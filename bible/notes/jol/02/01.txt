\v 1 Blow the trumpet in Zion,
\qAnd sound an alarm in my holy mountain!
\qLet all the inhabitants of the land tremble in fear,
\qFor the day of Yahweh comes,
\qIndeed, it is near.
\q
\v 2 It is a day of darkness and gloom,
\qA day of clouds and thick darkness.
\qAs the dawn spreads upon the mountains
\qA large and mighty army approaches.
\qThere has never been an army like them,
\qNeither will there be after,
\qEven after many generations.
