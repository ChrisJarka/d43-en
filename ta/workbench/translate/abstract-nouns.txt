====== Abstract Nouns ======

Remember that nouns are words that refer to a person, place, thing, or idea. ABSTRACT NOUNS are nouns that refer to things that cannot be seen, heard, tasted, smelled or touched in a physical sense. Ideas and things like 'peace' are real, but cannot be seen or touched in a physical sense.

===== Examples of Abstract Nouns =====

joy, peace, creation, goodness, contentment, justice, attitude, freedom, vengeance

Hint: English uses common word endings (suffixes) that may help identify abstract nouns. They include such endings as: -tion; -ism; -ity; -ment; -ness; -age; -ance; -ence; -ship; -ability; -acy

=== Reason This May Be an Issue ===

The Bible that you use to translate from may use abstract nouns to express certain ideas.

Your language might not use abstract nouns; instead, it might use verbs or adjectives to express some of those ideas.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  - If your language has an abstract noun that matches the meaning of the noun in the Bible, use it.
  - If your language has a verb or adjective that expresses the meaning of the noun, reword the sentence and use the verb or adjective.

===== Examples of Translation Suggestions =====

Two examples for Translation Suggestion 1: \\ //from childhood you have known the sacred writings//  2 Tim 3:15

The abstract noun "childhood" can be translated with the concrete noun "child."

  * Ever since you were a child you have known the sacred writings.
  * Even when you were a child, you came to know the sacred writings.

//But godliness with contentment is great gain.//  1 Tim 6:6

The abstract nouns "godliness," contentment," and "gain" can be translated with adjectives such as "godly," "content," and "beneficial."

  * But being godly and content is very beneficial.

The idea of "gain" can also be translated with the verbs "benefit" or "help." Sometimes the words may need to be moved around to form a good sentence.

  * But we benefit greatly when we are godly and content.
  * Being godly and content helps us.

Two examples for Translation Suggestion 2: \\ //Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.//  Luke 19:9

The abstract noun "salvation" can be translated with the verb "save."

  * The people in this house have been saved...

Depending on how you reword this sentence, you may need to include the person who saves the people:

  * God has saved the people in this house...

//You have shown me great kindness in saving my life//  Genesis 19:19

The noun "kindness" can be translated with the adjective "kind."

  * You have been very kind to me by saving my life

The noun "life" can be translated with the verb "live."

  * You have shown me great kindness in saving me so that I might live.

Remember that **//nouns//** are by definition a person, place, thing or idea. **ABSTRACT NOUNS**  involves experiencing ideas that cannot be seen, heard, tasted, smelled or touched in a physical sense. Ideas and things like 'peace' are equally real, but can not be seen or touched in a physical sense.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

**ABSTRACT NOUNS**  are powerful tools that present unique problems. For abstract nouns it is important to understand the culture in Hebrew, Aramaic or Greek. It is also important to be aware of a reader's likely understanding of a concept. In addition to the careful selection of abstract nouns, the use of related concrete nouns helps to make the meaning clear.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Luke 19:8-10 //Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I will restore four times the amount." 9 Jesus said to him, "Today//** salvation**// has come to this house, because he, too, is a son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the people who are lost."//

Salvation is an abstract noun. The phrase, "salvation has come to this house" can be translated with the verb 'save': “God has saved this household.”

===== Examples from English =====

English uses common word endings (suffixes) that may help identify abstract nouns. They include such endings as: -tion; -ism; -ity; -ment; -ness; -age; -ance; -ence; -ship; -ability; -acy

  * For example, the word "child" is a concrete noun. A child is a touchable being. Childhood, though, is not something which can be touched and is a concept that relates to children. "Childhood" is an //abstract noun//.
  * Another example is 'son.' Son is a concrete noun that describes an individual. “Sonship” is an abstract noun that refers to the essence of the relationship of being a son.
  * Other abstract nouns point directly to ideas, attitudes, emotions or characteristics. Goodness, contentment and justice are examples of those types of abstract nouns.
