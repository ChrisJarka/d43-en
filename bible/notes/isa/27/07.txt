<usfm> \p \q1 \v 7 Has Yahweh struck Jacob and Israel as he struck those nations who struck them, or have Jacob and Israel been killed as the slaughter of those nations that were killed by them? \q1 \v 8 In exact measure you have contended, sending Jacob and Israel away; he drove them away with his severe wind, on the day of the east wind. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Has Yahweh struck Jacob and Israel as he struck those nations who struck them**- This rhetorical question is answered with a denial. "Yahweh has not punished Israel in the same way he has punished other nations." (See Rhetorical Question) Judgement on other nations will be more severe.
  * **bold words**  - "In measure" means "with forbearance and moderation" - the punishment being carefully adjusted to the degree of the offence. God was about to "put Judah away" - to banish her into a far country; but still he would refrain himself - he would "not suffer his whole displeasure to arise," or give her over wholly to destruction.
In the day of the east wind , or of the national catastrophe, when his breath was fierce and hard against his people, he would "sigh" at the needful chastisement.
