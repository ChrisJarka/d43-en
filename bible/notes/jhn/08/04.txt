\v 4 They said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught  commiting adultery with her lover. She was with a man who was not her husband.
\v 5 Moses commanded us in the Law that he gave us, that we punish such a woman by throwing stones at her and dropping large rocks on her, until she dies.  So what do you say we should do?"
\v 6 They asked this question as a trap so that they could accuse him. If he said that they should not kill her, they would shame him as being one disobeyed the Law of Moses. If he said that they should kill her, they could accuse him to the Roman governor of taking a right of capital punishment, which they did not have under Roman law.
\p But Jesus bent down and wrote something on the ground with his finger.

to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
