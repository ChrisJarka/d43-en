\v 13 You punished us because we were very guilty for having done wicked things. But you have not punished us as much as we deserve to be punished. \add I say this because\add* you, our God, have allowed some of us to survive.
\v 14 However, some of us are again disobeying your commands, and we are marrying women who do those detestable things. If we continue to do that, surely you will get rid of all of us \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, with the result that none of us will remain alive.

\v 13 And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that you our God have punished us
less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such a remnant,
\v 14 shall we again break your commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? would not
you be angry with us till you had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?
