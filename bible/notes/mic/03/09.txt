\v 9 Now listen to this,
\qYou leaders of the house of Jacob,
\qand rulers of the house of Israel,
\qWho detest justice,
\qand pervert everything right.
\q
\v 10 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
\v 11 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money:
yet they lean upon Jehovah, and say, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us.
