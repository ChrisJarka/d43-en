\q
\v 23 When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him,
\q And will rain it upon him while he is eating.
\q
\v 24 He shall flee from the iron weapon,
\q And the bow of brass shall strike him through.
\q
\v 25 He draweth it forth, and it comes out of his body;
\q Yea, the glittering point comes out of his gall:
\q Terrors are upon him.
