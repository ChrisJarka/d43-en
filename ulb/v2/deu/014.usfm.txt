\c 14
\p
\v 1 You are the children of Jehovah your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyous for the
dead.
\v 2 For you are a holy people to Jehovah your God, and Jehovah has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above
all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.
\p
\v 3 You shall not eat any abominable thing.
\v 4 These are the beasts which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
\v 5 the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the antelope, and the chamois.
\v 6 And every beast that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two,
and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may you eat.
\v 7 Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the
hare, and the coney; because they chew the cud but part not the hoof, they are unclean to you.
\v 8 And the swine, because he parts the hoof but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean to you: of their flesh you shall not
eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch.
\p
\v 9 These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales may you eat;
\v 10 and whatever has not fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean to you.
\p
\v 11 Of all clean birds you may eat.
\v 12 But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,
\v 13 and the glede, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind,
\v 14 and every raven after its kind,
\v 15 and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kind,
\v 16 the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,
\v 17 and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant,
\v 18 and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
\v 19 And all winged creeping things are unclean to you: they shall not be eaten.
\v 20 Of all clean birds you may eat.
\p
\v 21 You shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: you may give it to the sojourner that is within your gates, that
he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner: for you are a holy people to Jehovah your God. You shall not boil a
kid in its motherâ€™s milk.
\p
\v 22 You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed, that which comes forth from the field year by year.
\v 23 And you shall eat before Jehovah your God, in the place which he shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, the
tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock; that you may learn
to fear Jehovah your God always.
\v 24 And if the way be too long for thee, so that you are not able to carry it, because the place is too far from thee, which
Jehovah your God shall choose, to set his name there, when Jehovah your God shall bless thee;
\v 25 then shall you turn it into money, and bind up the money in your hand, and shall go to the place which Jehovah your God
shall choose:
\v 26 and you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong
drink, or for whatever your soul asks of thee; and you shall eat there before Jehovah your God, and you shall rejoice, you
and your household.
\v 27 And the Levite that is within your gates, you shall not forsake him; for he has no portion nor inheritance with thee.
\p
\v 28 At the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall lay it
up within your gates:
\v 29 and the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with thee, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the
widow, that are within your gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that Jehovah your God may bless you in all the
work of your hand which you doest.
