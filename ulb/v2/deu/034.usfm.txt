\c 34
\p
\v 1 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And Jehovah
showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,
\v 2 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea,
\v 3 and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, to Zoar.
\v 4 And Jehovah said to him, This is the land which I sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it
to your seed: I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over thither.
\v 5 So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Jehovah.
\v 6 And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knows of his sepulchre to this
day.
\v 7 And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
\v 8 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the mourning for
Moses were ended.
\p
\v 9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of
Israel listened to him, and did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
\v 10 And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like to Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,
\v 11 in all the signs and the wonders, which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
and to all his land,
\v 12 and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.
