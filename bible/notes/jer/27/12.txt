\v 12 So I declared to Zedekiah the king of Judah according to all these words and said, “Place your necks into the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and live!
\v 13 Why will you die—you and your people—by the sword, famine, and plague, just as Yahweh has declared concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
