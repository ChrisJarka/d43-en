\v 22 Let God tell you \add what things are right for you to do, but do not try to force others to accept what you believe. God is\add* pleased with those who do what they know is right and as a result do not feel guilty \add concerning what they have done\add*, \add because they have done only\add* those things that they believe are right.
\v 23 But some believers are not certain \add that God will approve of their eating a certain kind of food\add*. So if they eat it, \add they think that God will punish\add* them. And they \add truly\add* will be punished \f + \ft Or:\add God truly\add* will punish them \f*, because \add they have done things that they\add* believe \add are not right\add*. Those who do anything without being certain \add that God considers it to be right\add* are sinning.

\v 22 Let God tell you what things are right for you to do, but do not try to force others to accept what you believe. God is pleased with those who do what they believe is right and do not feel guilty about it.
\v 23 But some believers are not certain that God will be pleased if they eat a certain kind of food. So if they eat it, they think that God will punish them. And he will truly punish them, because they have done things that they believe are not right. If we do anything without being certain that God considers it to be right, we are sinning.

\v 22 The faith that you have, you have according to yourself before God. Blessed is the one who does not judge himself in respect to what he approves.
\v 23 He who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **The faith that you have, you have according to yourself before God.** - So whether you have a strong faith or a weak faith that is between you and God."
    * **you...you...yourself** - singular. Because Paul is addressing the believers, you may have to translate this using plural. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou|]])
    * **Blessed is the one who does not judge himself in respect to what he approves**  - "Blessed are those who do not feel guilty for what they decide to do"
    * **He who doubts is condemned if he eats** - This can be translated with an active verb: "God will punish the person who is not sure if it is right to eat a certain food, but then eats it anyway" (see UDB) or "The person who is not sure if it is right to eat a certain food, but then eats it anyway will have a troubled conscience." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
    * **because it is not from faith** - This can be translated as a new sentence: "God will punish him because he is eating something he believes God does not want him to eat." 
    * **and whatever is not from faith is sin** - "You are sinning if you do something that you do not believe God wants you to do."
