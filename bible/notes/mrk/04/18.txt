\v 18 And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,
\v 19 and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word,
and it becomes unfruitful.
\v 20 And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold,
and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.
