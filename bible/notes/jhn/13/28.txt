\v 28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him.
\v 29 For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or,
that he should give something to the poor.
\v 30 He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night.
