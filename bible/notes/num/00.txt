**Who wrote Numbers?**\\

Moses wrote Numbers. One of the most striking aspects of this book is that Moses could give such a candid and honest account of his own failures. The honesty of Scripture about the weaknesses and sins of the greatest leaders is evidence of the validity of the accounts. Moses praises himself, but he also tells of his profound weaknesses. However, later scribes and priests put the book in its present form, including material from other sources such as eyewitness accounts, and books of history (21:14), “The Book of the Wars of the LORD,” is a book that may have been completed after Moses’ death, and was known by later scribes, who worked on the book of Numbers.

**What is Numbers about?**\\

The title of this book, “Numbers” refers to the counting or census that was to be taken of the children of Israel. Though Numbers is often thought to have only census information, or lists of numbers, this is not the case. It is a complex book, recording a broad set of matters, and including a long historical narrative. It has in fact the longest narrative about the people of Israel of any book of the Pentateuch, except Genesis. The account begins at Mt. Sinai, and ends forty years later at the southern border of Canaan. It is the story of the defeats and disappointment of the people of Israel. The nation of Israel, often defeated, was very discouraged, and they rebelled against the leaders God had given them. The great tragedy of Kadesh Barnea is that the people of Israel failed to enter the land of promise. They were so frightened by the report of some of the spies that they refused to go into the land of Promise. Yahweh delayed Israel’s entry into the Promised Land for forty years (13:1–14:45). As a matter of fact, none of them, except Joshua and Caleb, were permitted to enter the Land of Promise. This book is also a study on the faults, and frailty, as much as the courage of Moses their leader. 

**What are the different parts of Numbers?**\\

Numbers has three major parts. The first part covers the account of Israel at Sinai, the account regarding the preparation to go to the land of promise (1:1–10:10), and the journey from Sinai to Kadesh (10:11–12:16). The second part covers the account of Israel at Kadesh, the delay related to Israel’s rebellion (13:1–20:13), and the journey to the plains of Moab (20:14–22:1). 
As for the third part, it covers the account of Israel on the plains of Moab, and the hope for the land of promise (22:2–32:42).
