\v 11 You Ephesians were non-Jews from the time that you were born. The Jews insult you by calling you 'those who are not circumcised' They proudly call themselves 'we who are circumcised.' They have allowed people to circumcise them to indicate that they are God's people, but that has only changed their bodies, not their inner beings.
\v 12 You should constantly remember these things: Formerly you did not have any relationship with Christ. You did not belong to the people of Israel, the people whom God chose. You did not know about the things God promised in his agreements with his people. You did not confidently expect to go to heaven after you die. You lived in this world without knowing God.

\p
\v 11 Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands;
\v 12 that you were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
