<usfm>
\v 17 You people of Jerusalem, wake up!
\q2 You have experienced Yahweh severely punishing you.
\q1 Yahweh has caused you to suffer much
\q2 and to experience disaster.
\q1 Yahweh gave you this cup to drink, but this was Yahweh's cup! 
\q2 He forced you to drink every drop out of that large cup, down to the bottom of the bowl. And that drink made you  stagger like you  had drunk strong wine. This strong wine represents the anger of God, and you are to drink all of it!
\q1
\v 18 Now you do not have any children 
\q1 who are able to take your hand and guide you. You cannot help yourself.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem** - Yahweh speaks directly to Jerusalem, even though its people are not present, to add emphasis to his message. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **Awake, awake, stand up** - "Be alert and arise." The repetition of the word "awake" emphasizes the urgency of the call to arouse the people of Israel. It is not literally to wake them from sleep.
  * **Jerusalem** - Here Jerusalem refers to the people who live there. AT: "you people of Jerusalem" [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **you who drank the bowl of Yahweh's anger ... you drained it** - Yahweh speaks of punishing his people as if he forced them to drink from a bowl that was filled with his anger. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **from his hand** - Here Yahweh is referred to by his hand to emphasize that he is giving the bowl to his people. AT: "that he gave to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **you drank the bowl** - The word "bowl" refers to what is in the bowl. AT: "you drank from the bowl" or "you drank the wine that was in the bowl" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the bowl of staggering** - The word "bowl" refers to what is inside the bowl. AT: "the wine that causes a person to stagger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **you drained it** - "you drank all of it"
  * **staggering** - not walking straight or stumbling while walking
  * **There is no one among all the sons she has born to guide her ... to take her by the hand** - These two clauses have the same meaning and can be combined. This speaks of Jerusalem being helpless as if the city were a drunk woman without a son to help her walk safely. AT: "You have no one to help you! You are like a drunk old woman without a son to take her by the hand and guide her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
