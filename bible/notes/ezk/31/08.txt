\v 8 Cedars in the garden of God could not equal it!

\q And all the trees of Eden that were in the garden of God envied it!"

===== Important Terms: =====

  * cedars
  * garden
  * Eden
  * envied

===== Translation Notes: =====

The comparison of Assyria to a tree continues.

  * **Cedars in the garden of God could not equal it!** - "Assyria was greater than the Garden of Eden".  This is a great exageration to say that Assyria was greater than Eden. Eden was created perfect. (See: Hyperbole).
  * **garden of God**  - This is another way to say Eden.
