"Food" and "joy and gladness" have been taken away. Alternate translation: "because there all the food is gone and there cannot be sacrifices to Yahweh, all the joy and gladness of Israel is gone." (See:[[:en:ta:translate:parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **our eyes**  This pronoun refers to the nation of Israel and Joel is including himself in this statement.
  * **seeds rot under their clods… granaries are desolate… barns have been broken down… grain has withered**  - These statements emphasize that completeness of the devastation of Israel's food supply. Alternate translation: "we have no food: what we plant doesn't grow, what we stored, where we stored, and what was already have also been destroyed."
