\v 8 Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by
night: and he said, "Divine to me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whoever I shall name to thee."
\v 9 the woman said to him, "Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those that have familiar
spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then lay you a snare for my life, to cause me to die?"
\v 10 Saul swore to her by Jehovah, saying, "As Jehovah liveth, there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing."
