====== 1 Corinthians 15:12-14 ======

\v 12 So now \add let me ask you this\add*: Since \add we\add* have all preached to you that Christ was raised again \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* caused Christ to become alive \f* after he died, no one among you should be saying that \add God\add* will not cause \add believers\add* to become alive again after they die!\f + \ft Or: why do some of you say that \add God\add* will not cause \add believers\add* to become alive again after they die? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 13 If \add it is true that God\add* will not cause anyone to become alive again, that situation would mean that Christ was not raised from the dead \f + \ft Or:\add he\add* did not cause Christ to become alive again \f*!
\v 14 And if Christ was not raised from the dead \f + \ft Or:if \add God\add* did not cause Christ to become alive again \f*, then what we preached to you was useless, and your believing \add in Christ\add* is useless.

\v 12 Now if Christ is proclaimed to you as risen Savior, raised from the dead with all these witnesses to bear testimony to him, how can some of you teach that there is no such thing as a resurrection from the dead?
\v 13 If there were no resurrection from the dead, then how is Christ raised? He could not have been raised if there is no such thing as resurrection.
\v 14 It would follow that, if there is no resurrection, then the Christian gospel is pointless and, most alarmingly, your faith is meaningless.

\v 12 Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead?
\v 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised.
\v 14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.
