\v 15 God also said to Isaiah,
\q These people have become unable to really listen to me;
\q They have become unable to really hear what I say.
\q It is as if they wanted to keep their eyes shut,
\q As if they did not really want to see anything,
\q As if they did not really want to hear anything.
\q They are like this so they will not think they must stop sinning;
\q They are like this so they will not think they need for me to save them.

\q
\v 15 For this people's heart has become dull,
\q and they are hard of hearing,
\q and they have closed their eyes,
\q so they should not see with their eyes,
\q or hear with their ears,
\q or understand with their hearts,
\q so they would turn again,
\q and I would heal them.'
