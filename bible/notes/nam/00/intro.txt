====== Introduction to Nahum ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

===Outline of Nahum===

  - Introduction, “the book of the vision of Nahum” (1:1)
  - The psalm of the destruction of Nineveh (1:2-15)
    - The power and goodness of Yahweh to conquer his enemies (1:2-8)
    - The destruction of Nineveh for their evil (1:9-15)
  - The overthrow of Nineveh, the attackers; the destruction; the devastation (2:1-13)
  - The doom of Nineveh and the celebration of its enemies (3:1-19)


===What is Nahum about?===

Jonah and Nahum are two different chapters about the city of Nineveh. While Jonah was about its repentance, Nahum was about its destruction. The chief reasons for Yahweh’s destruction of Nineveh was their ruthless military power and their greed. The people of Nineveh were immoral and ruthless people.  
The prophecy ends with a celebration by the prophet Nahum and the enemies of Assyria when Nineveh was destroyed. 

===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Nahum" may also be called the "The book about Nahum" or "The sayings of Nahum."

===Who wrote Nahum?===

It is likely that Nahum wrote this book. He was a [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophet]] from Elkosh, an unknown city which was probably in Judah. The book was written before the fall of Nineveh, about 612 BC. The prophet also mentions the sack of Thebes, which occurred about 663 BC, so this is the time-frame in which Nahum was written.
