<usfm> \v 25 At that time Jesus prayed, "Father, you rule over everything in heaven and on the earth. I thank you that you have prevented people who think that they are wise and well-educated from knowing these things.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus prays to his heavenly Father while still in the presence of the crowd of people.

  * **O Father **- This refers to God the Father, not an earthly father.
  * **Lord of heaven and earth**  - “Master over everyone and everything in heaven and earth”
  * **concealed **- "hid" - This word is the opposite of "revealed."
  * **these things**  - This refers to Jesus' previous teaching. It may be best to simply say “these things” and let the reader determine the meaning.
  * **the wise and understanding**  - “from people who are wise and understanding.” This can be translated as “from people who think they are wise and understanding.” (See: Irony)
  * **revealed them**  - The pronoun "them" refers to "these things" earlier in this verse.
  * **to those who are untaught, like little children**  - This whole phrase can be translated "to infants" or "to little children." The word in the Greek refers to very young children. Possible meanings are 1) “to those who are untaught” (ULB) or 2) “to those who accept your truth readily” (see UDB).
  * **like little children **- In the ULB, "like little children" is a simile for people who are not wise or well-educated, or people who know that they are not wise and well-educated. (See: Simile<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>)</font>
  * **for so it was well-pleasing in your sight**  - “for you saw that it was good to do that”
  * **All things have been entrusted to me from my Father**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "My Father has entrusted all things to me" or “My Father has handed everything over to me.”(See: Active or Passive)
  * **no one knows the Son except the Father**  - This means “Only the Father knows the Son.”
  * **knows the Son**  - The word that is translated as “knows” means to know from personal experience. God the Father knew Jesus to this degree.
  * **the Son**  - Jesus was referring to himself in the third person. (See: First, Second or Third Person)
  * **no one knows the Father except the Son**  - This means “Only the Son knows the Father.”
  * **knows the Father**  - The word that is translated as “knows” means to know from personal experience. Jesus knew God his Father in that way.
  * **and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal him**  - This can be translated as “people know who the Father is only if the Son wants to reveal the Father to them.”
  * **to whom the Son desires to reveal him**  - The pronoun "him" refers to God the Father.
