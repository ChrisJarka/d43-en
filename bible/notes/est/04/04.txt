\v 4 And Esther’s maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent
raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he received it not.
\v 5 Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him
to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.
