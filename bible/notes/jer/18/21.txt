\q
\v 21 Therefore give their children to the famine, and give them over to the hand of the sword!
\q So let their women become bereaved and widows, and their men become those slain among the dead.
\v 22 Let a distressed cry be heard from their houses, for you will bring marauders upon them suddenly!
\q For they have dug a gorge to capture me and hidden traps for my feet!
\q
\v 23 But Yahweh, you yourself know all of their plans against me to kill me.
\q Do not atone for their iniquities and their sins! Do not wipe them away from before you.
\q But let them be overthrown before you! Act against them in the time of your wrath!
