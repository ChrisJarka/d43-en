====== General notes about Genesis 1 ======

**Formatting in this chapter**\\

This chapter presents the first account of God creating the world. There is a pattern to this account: "God said...God saw that it was good...This was evening and morning, the first day." Translators should preserve this pattern in their versions.

**Special concepts in this chapter**\\

This account of creation is told in the framework of the ancient Hebrew ideas of what the universe was like: the earth was resting with water around it and below it. Over the earth was something like a vast dome, called "an expanse between the waters" (1:6), on top of which was more water.
