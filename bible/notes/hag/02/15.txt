\v 15 So now, consider from this day forward, before stone was laid upon stone in the temple of Yahweh,
\v 16 whenever someone came to the grainery for twenty measures, there were only ten, and whenever someone came to the
winevat to draw out fifty measures, there were only twenty.
\v 17 I struck you and all the work of your hands with blight and mildew, but you still did not turn to me.'--this is Yahweh's declaration.
