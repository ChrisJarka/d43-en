\c 64
\p
\v 1 Oh that you would rend the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence,
\v 2 as when fire kindles the brushwood, and the fire causes the waters to boil; to make your name known to your
adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!
\v 3 When you did terrible things which we looked not for, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.
\v 4 For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen a God besides thee, who works
for him that waits for him.
\v 5 You meet him that rejoices and works righteousness, those that remember you in your ways: behold, you was wroth,
and we sinned: in them have we been of long time; and shall we be saved?
\v 6 For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as
a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
\v 7 And there is none that calls upon your name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for you have hid your face
from us, and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.
\p
\v 8 But now, O Jehovah, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.
\v 9 Be not angry very sore, O Jehovah, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all your
people.
\v 10 Your holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
\v 11 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are
laid waste.
\v 12 Wilt you refrain yourself for these things, O Jehovah? will you hold your peace, and afflict us very sore?
