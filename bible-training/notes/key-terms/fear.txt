====== fear ======


===== Definition: =====


When used in a Biblical context, the word fear refers to a proper respect for God; similar to the concept of awe. It is not cowering down in an expectation that you will be struck down by wrath.


    * Moses told the Israelites to fear God so that they would not sin
    * Israel's King Solomon said that wisdom starts with the fear (or respect) of God
