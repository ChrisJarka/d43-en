==== Description ====

Normally commands are used to tell someone to do something. Sometimes they are used in the Bible for other functions.

**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages would not use a command for some of the functions that commands are used for in the Bible.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

Commands are normally used to tell someone to do something. 

=== First Person Commands ===

A command can also be used __to tell a group to do something with the speaker__. In the ULB and UDB in English, this is shown with "let us."  

In Genesis 11, the people were not telling someone to let, or allow, them to make bricks. They were saying that they all should make bricks.
>They said to one another, "Come, __let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly__." (Genesis 11:3  ULB)

In Mark 1 Jesus told his disciples to go with him to other places. 
>__Let us go elsewhere__, out into the surrounding towns, so that I may preach there also. That is why I came out here. (Mark 1:38 ULB)

=== Third Person Commands === 
A command can also be used to say __what someone else should do__ or what should happen. In the ULB and UDB in English this is usually shown with "may" or "let" before the one who is to do it.

In Luke 16 Abraham was not telling the rich man to allow his brothers to listen to Moses and the prophets. He was telling him that his brothers ought to listen to them.
>But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the prophets; __let them listen to them__.' (Luke 16:29 ULB)

In Genesis 28 Isaac blessed Jacob by declaring that God would do these things for him.
>May God Almighty bless you, make you fruitful and multiply you, (Genesis 28:3) 

In Deuteronomy the Levites cursed anyone who would make an idol by declaring that he was cursed.

>May the man be cursed who makes a carved or cast figure, something disgusting to Yahweh, the work of the hands of a craftsman, and who sets it up in secret.'   (Deuteronomy 27:15 ULB)

=== Performative Commands === 

A command can also be used __to perform something__. In the example below, the man could not heal himself of his leprosy. When Jesus told him to be clean, that is, to be healed, Jesus actually healed him by commanding it.
> “I am willing. __Be clean__.” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. (Matthew 8:3 ULB)

In the command below, God not only commanded that there should be light, but he caused it to exist.
>God said, "__Let there be light__," and there was light. (Genesis 1:3 ULB)

=== Commands that Function as Conditions === 
A command can also be used like a __conditional statement__.  The proverbs mainly tell about life and things that often happen. The pur

The purpose of the the Proverbs 4:6 below is not to give a command, but to tell what people can expect to happen if they do not abandon wisdom and if they love wisdom.

>do not abandon wisdom and she will watch over you; 
>love her and she will keep you safe. (Proverbs 4:6 ULB)

The purpose of the the Proverbs2:6 below is tell what people can expect to happen if teach their children the way they should go. 

>Teach a child the way he should go,
>and when he is old he will not turn away from that instruction. (proverbs 22:6 ULB)

==== Translation Strategies ====
  - If the function of a command would not be understood correctly in your language, __use a sentence type__ that would express that function.
  - If the function of a command would not be understood correctly in your language, __use a verb form__ that would express that function.
  - If the function of a command would not be understood correctly in your language, __use pronouns__ that would make it clear.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ==== 

1. If the function of a command would not be understood correctly in your language, use a sentence type that would express that function.
>Teach a child the way he should go,
>and when he is old he will not turn away from that instruction. (proverbs 22:6 ULB)

"If you teach a child the way he should go,
when he is old he will not turn away from that instruction."


  * **Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be clean.” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy.** (Matthew 8:3 ULB)
    * * "Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing. I now cleanse you."  Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy."


2. If the function of a command would not be understood correctly in your language, use a verb form that would express that function.
  * **They have Moses and the prophets; let them listen to them.**(Luke 16:29 ULB)
    * "They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them."


3. If the function of a command would not be understood correctly in your language, use pronouns that would make it clear.
  * **Let us go elsewhere, out into the surrounding towns (Mark 1:38 ULB)
    * "Go with me elsewhere, out into the surrounding towns"
