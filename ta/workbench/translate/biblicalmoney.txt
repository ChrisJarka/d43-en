  - Do not use modern money values since these change from year to year. Using them will cause the Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate.

  - Keep the Bible term and spell it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  - Describe the value of the money in terms of its weight and what material it is made of.
  - Describe the value of he money terms of what people in Bible times could earn in a day's work.
  - Use the Bible term and give the equivalent amount in the text or a note.
