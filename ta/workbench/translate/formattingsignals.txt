==== Description ====

As part of a discourse  (Writing Styles) page that tells about things that are off-topic 

[[Should it be about all formatting signals, or just when they are used to tell about things that are off-topic?]]
 
 
The ULB and UDB use the following: \\  
**Long dashes** introduce information that is immediately relevant to what came before it. 

>Then two men will be in a field—one will be taken, and one will be left behind. Two women will be grinding with a mill—one will be taken, and one will be left. Therefore be on your guard, for you do not know on what day your Lord will come. (Matthew 24:40-41 ULB)
 
**Parentheses** are used to show that some information is an explanation or afterthought. It does not contribute as well to the point of the passage.

John wrote the book called John. In verse 6 he interrupted the story he was telling to explain that Jesus already know what he was going to do. This is put in parentheses.

><sup>5</sup>When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming to him, he said to Philip, "Where are we going to buy bread so that these may eat?" <sup>6</sup>(Now Jesus said this to test Philip, for he himself knew what he was going to do.)<sup>7</sup>Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be sufficient for each one to have even a little." (John 6:5-7 ULB)


Matthew wrote the book called Mathew. In Matthew 24:4-51 he quoted what Jesus was saying. The words in the parentheses below are not what Jesus was saying, but what Matthew was saying to the reader. 

>Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place __(let the reader understand)__, let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out anything that is in his house, 18and let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak.  (Matthew 24:15-18 ULB)


>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip and said, "Arise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This road is in a desert.) He arose and went. (Acts 8:26 ULB)
 
**Indentation** is used to show 1) poetic lines, 2) the start of a new paragraph, and 3) that a paragraph is quoted material. 

The lines in poetry are indented.
><sup>1</sup>Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked,
>or stand in the pathway with sinners,
>or sit in the assembly of mockers.
><sup>2</sup>But his delight is in the law of Yahweh,
and on his law he meditates day and night. (Psalm 1:1-2 ULB)

In the ULB, the first line of a paragraph is often indented to the right.
>When Jesus had come into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying sick with a fever. Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and started serving him.  (Matthew 8:14 ULB)






Sometimes a whole paragraphs is indented to show that it is quoted. Verse 6 below is a quote from the Old Testament, and it is indented to the right in the ULB.

><sup>4</sup>Herod brought together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and he asked them, "Where is the Christ to be born?" <sup>5</sup> They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what was written by the prophet, \\ 
><sup>6</sup>'And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
>are not the least among the leaders of Judah,
>for from you will come a ruler
>who will shepherd my people Israel.'"\\ 
><sup>7</sup>Then Herod secretly called the learned men to ask them exactly what time the star had appeared. (Matthew 2:4-7 ULB)
