An idiom is a word or phrase unique to a language or locality. An idiom has a special meaning distinct to the area in which the idiom was created by the people who first invented it. The meaning of an idiom is often only known to the people who live in the area in which it was created, because the idiom was invented there with a special usage and purpose in that language.

==== Description ====

**Definition**: An idiom is a phrase that has a special meaning to the people of the language or culture that uses it. Its meaning is different from what a person might understand from the meanings of the individual words.

> But I have __a baptism to be baptized with__, and how I am distressed until it is completed!  (Luke 12:50 ULB)\\
One meaning of “be baptized” is to be put completely in water. "Be baptized" is also an idiom meaning experience something  completely or intensely. Here Jesus used the idiom to refer to the terrible suffering he would experience when people would mock, torture, and kill him.  

**Purpose**: An idiom is created in a culture probably somewhat by accident when someone describes something in an unusual way. But, when that unusual way communicates the message powerfully and people understand it clearly, other people start to use it.

=== Reasons this is a translation issue ===

  * People can easily misunderstand idioms in the original languages of the Bible because they are not from the cultures that originally wrote the Bible.
  * People can easily misunderstand idioms that are in the source language Bibles because they are not forms the cultures that made those translations.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>For you are all __sons of__ the light and __sons of__ the day. We are not __sons of__ the night or the darkness.”  (1 Thessalonians 5:5 ULB)

The phrase “sons of” here is a Hebrew idiom used to refer to people who have a certain characteristic. Jews used this idiom even when speaking Greek. “Sons of light” refers to people who live and act in the “light,” that is, the truth.

>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God. If children, then also heirs, heirs of God __on the one hand__, and joint heirs __on the other hand__ with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.”  (Romans 8:16, 17 ULB)

The phrase “on the one hand … on the other hand” is an idiom that joins two different ways of thinking about something. When we think about being heirs, there are two special things to think. One is that we our heirs of God and our inheritance is from him; the other is that we are joint heirs with Christ, and we will inherit what he inherits. 

> When __day was breaking__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.” (John 21:4 ULB) 
The idiom “day was breaking” shows that it is very early in the morning and the sun was just coming up as the day was beginning. 

==== Translation Strategies ====
If the idiom would be clearly understood in your language, consider using it. If not, here are some other options.

  - Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.
  - Use a different idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.


==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.

  * **If children, then also heirs, heirs of God __on the one hand__, and joint heirs __on the other hand__ with Christ**  (Romans 8:17 ULB)
    * “If children, then also heirs, __not only__ heirs of God __but also__ joint heirs with Christ”
    * “If children, then also heirs, __both__ heirs of God __and__ joint heirs with Christ”

  * **When __day was breaking__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.**  (John 21:4 ULB)\\
    * "When __the day was starting, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus."
    * "When it was just starting to get light, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus."

2. Use a different idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.
