\v 9 And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said to him, Arise, get you down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.
\v 10 But if you fear to go down, go you with Purah your servant down to the camp:
\v 11 and you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall your hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp.
