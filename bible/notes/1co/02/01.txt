====== 1 Corinthians 02:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, when I came to you, I proclaimed to you the message that God had revealed to me. But I did not proclaim it using eloquent words that would make people think highly of me, nor did I argue in a way that unbelievers would think was very wise.
\v 2 I did that because I decided that I would speak only about Jesus Christ. Specifically, I told you  \add what he accomplished for us when\add* he was killed by being nailed \f + \ft Or:\add when they\add* killed him by nailing him \f* to a cross.

\v 1 When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not make beautiful speeches, nor did I repeat to you the things that wise men said. I told you the hidden truths about God.
\v 2 I decided not to talk to you about anything other than Jesus Christ and his death on the cross.

\p
\v 1 When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come with eloquence of speech or wisdom as I proclaimed hidden truths about God. 
\v 2 For I decided to know nothing when I was among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.

  * **eloquence of speech** - This means a persuasive and elegant way of speaking.
  * **hidden truths** - This means 'mystery.' See Important Terms.
  * **to know nothing** - This means that Paul focused on the crucifixion of Christ rather than on human ideas. By stating he would "know nothing .. except Christ" he was emphasizing complete focus on Christ (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **For I decided to know nothing when I was among you except Jesus Christ** This could be rephrased as: "For I decided to focus only on Christ Jesus when I was among you."
  * **and him crucified** - "and about him who was crucified."  This use of "him" without assumed preposition may be unclear. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
