\v 14 And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered
together, and went also after him.
\v 15 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against
the rampart; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
\v 16 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, to Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with
thee.
