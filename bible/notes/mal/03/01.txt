\v 1 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says this: "Look\f + \ft Or: Listen \f*! I am about to send my messenger who will prepare \add the people to receive me\add* when I come. You \add claim that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* you are wanting to see me, and I will suddenly come to my temple. The messenger \add who will tell you about a new\add* agreement, the one whom you are eagerly \f + \ft sarcasm \f* awaiting, is certainly going to come to you."
\p
\v 2 But will anyone \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be able to survive when he comes? Will anyone \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be able to remain standing in front of him? \add Probably not\add*, because he will be like \f + \ft simile \f* a blazing fire that refines\f + \ft Or: purifies \f* \add metal\f + \ft Or: gold \f*\add*. He will be like \f + \ft simile \f* a very strong soap \add that bleaches clothes\add*.
\v 3 \add He will be like a worker\add* who sits \add in front of his work\add* to cause silver to become pure by burning all the impurities. Like \add a worker refines\add* silver and gold, he will cause the descendants of Levi\f + \ft Or: priests \f* to become pure, \add in order that they will again become acceptable to\add* offer sacrifices that will be acceptable to him.

\p
\v 1 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his
temple; and the messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says Yahweh of armies.
\v 2 But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like
fullers’ soap.
\v 3 He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and
silver; and they will bring offerings of righteousness to Yahweh.
