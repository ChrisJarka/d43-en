====== Ecclesiastes 02:21-23 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 Some people work wisely and skillfully, using the things that they have learned. But \add when they die\add*, they leave everything, and someone who has not worked hard acquires those things. And that also seemed to be senseless and caused me to be discouraged.
\v 22 So, it seems that people do not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* get much for all the hard work that they do and for worrying.
\v 23 Every day the work that they do causes them to experience pain and to be worried. And during the night their minds are not able to rest. That also is very frustrating.

\v 21 Some people work wisely and skillfully, using the things that they have learned. But when they die, they leave everything, and someone who has not worked hard acquires those things. And that also seemed to be senseless and caused me to be discouraged.
\v 22 So, it is pointless for a man to labor and strive for all he does.
\v 23 Every day the work that they do causes them to experience pain and to be worried. And during the night their minds are not able to rest. That also shows how fleeting everything is.

<usfm>
\v 21 For there is a man that labors with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skil; but he will leave his portion to a man that has not labored. This also is vapor and a great evil.
\v 22 For why does  a man do all this labor, and all this striving in his heart that he labors under the sun?
\v 23 For every day his work is painful, and at night his soul does not find rest.This also is vaporous.
