You must appoint men who know the laws of your God. All of you must teach God's laws to others who do not know them.
\v 26 Everyone who does not obey God's laws or the laws of my government must be punished severely. Some of them will be executed, some will be put in prison, some will be sent out of the country or have all their property taken away from them.

\v 25 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the
people that are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of your God; and teach you him that knows them not.
\v 26 And whoever will not do the law of your God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all
diligence, whether it be to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
