===== Translator Qualifications =====

This module answers the question: How do I choose a translation team?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_whatis|What is Translation]]
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_why|Why We Translate the Bible]]

Before starting a translation project, as many church networks as possible should be contacted and encouraged to become a part of the translation and even to send some of their people to be a part of the translation team. They should be consulted and asked for their input into the translation project, its goals, and its process. 

- What is the age and local language background of each translator?

  * Does their work meet the expectations of their fellow translators and local church leaders? (Has the translator been willing to work with others in testing and checking their translation?)
