What is translation? Translation is the process of representing in one language (the "project language") the ideas found in a document (the "source text") written in a different language.

Why do translators do this? Translators in general have different reasons for doing their work. Their reasons depend on the kind of document they are translating, and the needs of the person who has asked them to translate it. In the case of Bible translation, people usually do their work because they want the Bible's ideas to affect the project language readers in the same way that the original readers and hearers of the biblical texts were affected. Because God's ideas in the Bible lead us to eternal life with him through Jesus Christ, translators also want project language readers to know his ideas.

How does the Bible translator usually expect to represent the biblical ideas? There are various ways in which we can represent the ideas in a source text: we can put them into a list, we can summarize them using far less space on the written page, we can simplify them (as we often do in children's Bible story books), or we can even put them into a diagram or chart. However, Bible translators usually try to present the biblical ideas as completely as possible. This also means that they try to produce in translation same kind of document as the original documents (a prophecy for a prophecy, a letter for a letter, a book of history for a book of history, etc.) Also, they try to create the same **tensions** in the translation that exist in the source texts.

What do we mean by "tension" in texts? Examples of tension occur when a reader wonders what will happen next to the participants in a story, or when a reader follows the argument, encouragement, and warnings of an epistle writer or of a conversation that is reported in the text. A reader can feel tension when reading a psalm, for example, since the praises of God affect the psalmist in various ways. When reading an Old Testament prophetic book, the reader can feel tension rise as the prophet condemns people for their sin, or as he warns them to turn back to God. And the reader can feel tension as he reads about God's promises for the future, and as he tries to learn about when God fulfilled those promises, or when he will fulfill them. Good translators study the kinds of tension in the source documents, and they try to reproduce those tensions in the project language.

How should translators use the ULB and UDB in translating the Bible? Translators can best use these two versions by remembering the following points:

  *   - The ULB tries to present ideas in the same order as they appear in the source text. The UDB does not.

>(Romans 1:1,7 ULB) Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, and set apart for the gospel of God...This letter is to all who are in Rome, the beloved of God.
>(Romans 1:1 UDB) I, Paul, who serve Christ Jesus, am writing this letter to all of you believers in the city of Rome. 

The ULB shows Paul's style of beginning his letters. He does not say who his audience is until verse 7. However, the UDB follows a style that is much more natural in English and most other languages today.

  *   - Often ideas in the text imply other ideas that are not made explicit in the ULB. However, the UDB often does make them explicit.

>(Luke 5:10 ULB) And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid, because from now on you will catch men."
>(Luke 5:10 UDB) But Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid! Until now you gathered in fish, but from now on you will gather in people to become my disciples." 

The UDB reminds the reader that Simon was a fisherman by trade. It also make clear the similarity that Jesus was drawing between Simon's previous work and his future work.
In addition, the UDB makes it clear why Jesus wanted Simon to "catch men" (ULB): "to become my disciples" (UDB)

>(Luke 5:12 ULB) When [a certain victim of leprosy] saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
>(Luke 5:12 UDB) When [a certain victim of leprosy] saw Jesus, he bowed down to the ground in front of him and pleaded with him, "Lord, please heal me, because you are able to heal me if you are willing!" 

The UDB makes it clear that the man did not fall to the ground by accident; instead, he deliberately bowed down to the ground. Also, the UDB makes it clear that he is asking Jesus to heal him. He only implies this request in the ULB.
