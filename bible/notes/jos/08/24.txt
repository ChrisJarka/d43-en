\p
\v 24 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness
wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel
returned to Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword.
\v 25 And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
\v 26 For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the
inhabitants of Ai.
