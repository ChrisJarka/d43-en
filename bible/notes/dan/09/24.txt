\p
\v 24 Seventy weeks are decreed upon your people and upon your holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins,
and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to
anoint the most holy.
\v 25 Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the
anointed one, the prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: it shall be built again, with street and moat, even in troublous times.
