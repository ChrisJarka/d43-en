\v 21 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the
arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver.
\v 22 In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter,
to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.
\v 23 And it shall be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity
to remembrance, that they may be taken.
