\v 36 Jehovah said moreover to me: Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? then declare to them their
abominations.
\v 37 For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery; and
they have also caused their sons, whom they bare to me, to pass through
the fire to them to be devoured.
