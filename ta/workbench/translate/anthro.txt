====== zzz- DO NOT USE - Anthropomorphism ======

Anthropomorphism is when God or animals are given traits or behaviors that usually only humans have.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Anthropomorphism should not be taken literally. The Bible is not saying that God has hands, or eyes, or ears, nor does he need to rest. Instead, the Bible uses anthropomorphism to relate to his followers on human terms.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**"And the Egyptians shall know that [[I am Yahweh when I reach out with my hand on Egypt and bring out the Israelites from among them."]]** (Exodus 7:5 ULB)

 **[[The eyes of Yahweh are on the righteous, and his ears are directed toward their cry.]]**  (Psalm 34:15 ULB) 

 **[[On the seventh day God came to the end of his work which he had done, and so he rested on the seventh day from all his work. 3God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it he rested from all his work which he had done in his creation."]]** (Genesis 2:2 ULB) 

===== Examples from English =====

 "My mother had a fondness for such [large words]; she liked to say them, and see other dogs look surprised and envious, as wondering how she got so much education…." A Dog’s Tale by Mark Twain "But I don’t want to go among mad people," Alice remarked. "Oh, you can’t help that," said the Cat: "we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad." Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland **
