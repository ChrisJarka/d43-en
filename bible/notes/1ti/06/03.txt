===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If anyone teaches false doctrines that do not agree with the reliable and true teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 4 that person is very proud and does not understand anything. They want to argue about unimportant matters and about certain words, and people who listen to them envy others. They quarrel with others and with one another. They say bad things about others. They suspect that others have evil motives.
\v 5 Their whole way of thinking has become completely wrong because they have rejected true things. As a result, they make the mistake of thinking that by doing religious things they will get a lot of money.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 3 If anyone teaches something that does not agree with the reliable instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching,
\v 4 he is proud and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy interest in controversies and arguments about words that result in envy, strife, insults, evil suspicions, 
\v 5 and constant conflict between people with depraved minds. They have lost the truth and they think that godliness is a way to get more money.
\f + \ft Some old copies add, \fqa Withdraw from such things, \fqa* but the best ancient copies do not. \f*

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **he is proud ... He has an unhealthy interest** - Here "he" refers to anyone in general that teaches what is not correct. To make this clear, you can translate "he" as "they" as in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **understands nothing** - "understands nothing about God's truth"
  * **He has an unhealthy interest in controversies and arguments** - Paul speaks of people who feel compelled to engage in useless arguments as if they were ill. Such people greatly desire to argue, and they do not really want to find a way to agree. AT: "all he wants to do is argue" or "he craves arguments" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **controversies and arguments about words that result in envy** - "controversies and arguments about words, and these controversies and arguments result in envy"

  * **depraved minds** - "wicked minds"
  * **They have lost the truth** - Here the word "They" refers to anyone who teaches anything that does not agree with the teaching of Jesus. The phrase "have lost the truth" represents ignoring it or forgetting it. AT: "They have ignored the truth" or "They have forgotten the truth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
