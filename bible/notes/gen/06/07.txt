===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I will wipe away mankind...from the surface of the earth** - AT: "I will destroy mankind whom I created so that there will not be any people on the earth"
  * **I will wipe away mankind whom I have created** - God created all mankind. Some languages would need to translate this as two sentences. AT: "I created mankind. I will wipe them away from the surface of the ground." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
  * **wipe away** - "wipe out." Here this is used in a negative sense, for God is talking about destroying the people because of their sin.
  * **Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh** - AT: "Yahweh looked favorably on Noah" or "Yahweh was pleased with Noah" (UDB)
  * **in the eyes of Yahweh** - Yahweh sees and knows what people do. AT: "in Yahweh's sight" or "in Yahweh's thoughts." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
