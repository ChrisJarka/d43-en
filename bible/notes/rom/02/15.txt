<usfm>
\v 15 They show that they know in their own minds what God commands in his law, for each person in his very own conscience either accuses himself of bad behavior or defends himself.
\v 16 God will punish them at the time when he will judge people according to what they have thought and done. He will judge them even for the things that they have done secretly. He will judge people by authorizing Christ Jesus  to judge them. This is  what I tell people when I preach the good news to them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 By this they show that the actions required by the law are written in their hearts. Their conscience also bears witness to them, and their own thoughts either accuse or defend them to themselves 
\v 16 and also to God. That will happen on the day when God will judge the secrets of all people, according to my gospel, through Jesus Christ.
