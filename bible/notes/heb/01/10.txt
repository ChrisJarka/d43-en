\v 10 And,
\q Thou, Lord, in the beginning did lay the foundation of the earth,
\q And the heavens are the works of your hands:
\q
\v 11 They shall perish; but you continuest:
\q And they all shall wax old as does a garment;
\q
\v 12 And as a mantle shall you roll them up,
\q As a garment, and they shall be changed:
\q But you are the same,
\q And your years shall not fail.
