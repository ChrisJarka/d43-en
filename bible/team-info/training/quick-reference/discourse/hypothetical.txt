====== Hypothetical Situations ======


===== Description =====

Something that is hypothetical is 'assumed' or 'supposed.' A hypothetical situation is a possible scenario from any point in time: past, present or future. This situation may or may not actually be true. It could possibly happen or it may never happen. A hypothetical situation might mean asking a “what if” question. It might be a “suppose” or “if only” statement.

=== Mat:24:08 ===

"But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine. Only you are not to take my son back there."

  * **But if**  - Abraham is answering the servant's hypothetical question from [[:en:bible:notes:gen:24:05|24:5]]. Abraham thinks this is an unlikely, even impossible, situation. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hypothetical]])

=== Gal:01:08 ===

"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you, he should be cursed."

  * **should proclaim**  - "would proclaim" or "were to proclaim." This is describing something that has not happened and should not happen. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hypothetical]])

=== Luk:22:67 ===

"saying, "If you are the Christ, tell us." But he said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe,"

  * **If I tell you, you will not believe**  - This is the first of two hypothetical statements by Jesus. It was a way for Jesus to respond without giving them a reason to say that he was guilty of blasphemy. Your language may have a way of indicating that the action has not actually happened.
