\v 4 but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
\v 5 even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace have you been saved),
\v 6 and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus:
\v 7 that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus:
