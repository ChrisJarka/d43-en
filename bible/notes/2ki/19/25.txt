\p I planned that your army \add the power to\add* capture many cities that were surrounded by high walls,
\p and cause them to become piles of rubble.

\v 26 The people who lived in those cities have no power,
\p and as a result they became dismayed and discouraged.
\p They are as frail as plants and grass in the fields,

\v 25 Hast you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it
should be your to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
\v 26 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field,
and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up.
