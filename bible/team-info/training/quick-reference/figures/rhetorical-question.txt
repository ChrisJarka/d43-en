  * **Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children**  - This rhetorical question emphasizes how unlikely it was for Sarah to have children. It can also be translated as a statement: "No one would have ever said to Abraham, 'Sarah will nurse children.'" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])

"So the captain came to him and said to him, 'What are you doing, sleeping? Get up! Call upon your god! Maybe your god will notice us and we will not perish.'"

"But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothing and quickly went out into the crowd, crying out and saying, "Men, why are you doing these things? We also are human beings with the same feelings as you."
