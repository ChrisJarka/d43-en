\v 7 \add Someone might object\add*, saying, "The laws \add that God gave Moses\add* must be evil \add if our sinful desires\add* are increased because of our knowing those laws. \f + \ft metonymy \f*\f + \ft Or: Are not the laws \add that God gave Moses\add* evil \add if they stir up our sinful desires\add*? \f*" \f + \ft metonymy, rhetorical question \f* \add I would reply\add* that they certainly are not \add evil, even though our sinful desires are increased\add*. What I would reply is that I, \add for example\add*, realized that \add what I was doing\add* was sinful only because\add of what is written\add* \f + \ft Or:\add Moses wrote\add* \f* \add in\add* those laws. For example, I realized that coveting \add is sinful\add* only because he wrote in those laws \f + \ft personification \f*, "You must not covet."
\v 8 And because of what that commandment \add stated\add*, my sinful \add desire to have things that belong to others\add* \f + \ft personification \f* caused me to covet in many ways. \add Our desire to\add* sin is not stimulated \f + \ft metaphor \f* when there is no law \add that prohibits our doing sinful things\add*.

\v 7 What will we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be. However I would not have known sin, if not through the law. For I had not known lust, except the law had said, "You shall not lust."
\v 8 but sin, taking the opportunity, brought about in me through the commandment every lust in me. For without the law, sin is dead.
