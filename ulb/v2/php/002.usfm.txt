\c 2

\v 1 If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
tender mercies and compassions,
\v 2 make full my joy, that you be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;
\v 3 doing nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than
himself;
\v 4 not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.
\v 5 Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
\v 6 who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,
\v 7 but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;
\v 8 and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient
even to death, yea, the death of the cross.
\v 9 Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;
\v 10 that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things
in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth,
\v 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
\p
\v 12 So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyoud, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out
your own salvation with fear and trembling;
\v 13 for it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.
\v 14 Do all things without murmurings and questionings:
\v 15 that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse
generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,
\v 16 holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither
labor in vain.
\v 17 Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:
\v 18 and in the same manner do you also joy, and rejoice with me.
\p
\v 19 But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your
state.
\v 20 For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.
\v 21 For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
\v 22 But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father,
so he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.
\v 23 Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:
\v 24 but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.
\v 25 But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your
messenger and minister to my need;
\v 26 since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because you had heard that he was sick:
\v 27 for indeed he was sick near to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not
have sorrow upon sorrow.
\v 28 I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less
sorrowful.
\v 29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:
\v 30 because for the work of Christ he came near to death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your
service toward me.
