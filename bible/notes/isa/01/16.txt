===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Wash, cleanse yourselves**  - The Law of Moses commanded that priest wash their hands before offering sacrifices. Here God is comparing that to the people's need to repent and be morally pure. This can be translated as: “Repent and wash the sin from your heart like you wash the dirt from your body.” (See: [[en/ta/translate:metaphor]])
  * **remove the evil of your deeds from my sight** - "take your evil deeds away from me"
  * **my** - This refers to God.
  * **the oppressed** - This refers to people in general who are oppressed. This could be translated as "people who are treated cruelly." (See: [[en:ta:translate:adjectivalnoun]])
  * **give justice to the fatherless** - "be fair to the children who do not have fathers"
  * **defend the widow** - "protect the women whose husbands have died"
