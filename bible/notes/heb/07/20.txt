\v 20 Furthermore, when God appointed Christ as a priest, he solemnly declared it. When God appointed former priests, he did not do this.
\v 21 But when he appointed Christ to be a priest, it was by these words that the psalmist wrote in scripture:
\q "The Lord has solemnly declared
\q —and he will not change his mind:
\q 'You will be a priest forever!'"

\v 20 And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,

\q "The Lord has sworn and he will not change his mind:
\q 'You are a priest forever.'"
