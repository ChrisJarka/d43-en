=== What is Romans about? ===

Paul was preparing to leave Corinth so he could take a gift of money to help the church in Jerusalem which  was suffering. Paul writes this letter to prepare for this journey to Rome, the most important city in the world at that time.  He stated his purpose was to “bring about the obedience of faith” (16:26). Most scholars would agree that Romans is the most profound and theologically rich letter in the New Testament. More has been written about the book of Romans than any other book of the Bible.

Paul of Tarsus was the author. He wrote to the Roman Christians, probably while he was staying in Corinth on the third of his missionary journeys.

Romans contains many new theological terms because the church needed to develop new terms to describe theologically important concepts. They "key terms" dictionary will help with translating specific terms. Also, because many of the terms are abstract Concepts, see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns|abstract nouns]].

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Romans? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of manuscripts that many believe are more accurate. The follow are the most significant issues in the Book of Romans:\\

  * "who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit." (8:1) 
  * "But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work." (11:6)
  * "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen." (16:24) (so noted in ULB)

Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to the Book of Romans.
