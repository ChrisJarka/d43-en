\v 9 For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the corn. Is it only for the oxen that God cares?
\v 10 Or does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written. Because both he that plows ought to plow in hope, and he that threshes, to thresh in hope of sharing in the harvest.
\v 11 If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap with you in your worldly things?
