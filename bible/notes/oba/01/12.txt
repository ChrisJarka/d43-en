\v 12 But do not gloat over your brother's day, in the day of his misfortune, and do not rejoice over the people of Judah in the
day of their destruction; do not boast in the day of their distress.
\v 13 Do not enter my people's gate in the day of their calamity; do not gloat over their affliction in the day of their disaster, do not loot their wealth in the day of their ruin.
\v 14 Do not stand at the crossroads, to cut off his fugitives and do not hand over his survivors in the day of distress.
