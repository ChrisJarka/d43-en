====== Empty Pages ======


As the team moves to a new assignment, all of the pages will initially be emptyâ€“they will only have placeholder words or phases, but no content.


The first team member who reaches a particular page should enter the initial, draft content if they feel confident to do so. This initial content does not be perfect. It is simply a starting point for the rest of the team to build upon.


If you arrive first at an empty page and do not feel confident to put in the first text, you have several options:


    - Add some comments about the page in the Discussion section to alert the team to important things to add.
    - Move on to another page that you may be more confident to edit.
    - Wait and come back after another member has had a chance to enter the initial content.
