===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **drew near** - "approached" or "went near"
  * **the city**  - This refers to Jerusalem.
  * **he wept over it** - The word "it" refers to the city of Jerusalem, but it represents the people who lived in that city. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy]])
  * **If only you had known ... the things which bring you peace**  - This can be translated "I wish so much that you knew ... the things which bring you peace" or "I am very sad because you do not know the things that bring you peace." This is an exclamation. Jesus was expressing his sadness that the people of Jerusalem did not know these things. (See: talink Exclamation) The implied information could be added if needed "If only you had known ... the things that would bring you peace, then you could have had peace." The word "you" can be singular to refer to the city, or plural to refer to the people of the city. (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:formsofyou]])
  * **they are hidden from your eyes**  - This can be translated as "you can no longer see them" or "you are unable to know it" (UDB).
