\v 6 You must not pervert justice that should go to your poor people in a poor man's lawsuit.
\v 7 Keep away from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked.
\v 8 Never take a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see, and perverts the words of the righteous.
