\c 38
\p
\v 1 Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
\q
\v 2 Who is this that darkens counsel
\q By words without knowledge?
\q
\v 3 Gird up now your loins like a man;
\q For I will demand of thee, and declare you to me.
\q
\v 4 Where was you when I laid the foundations of the earth?
\q Declare, if you have understanding.
\q
\v 5 Who determined the measures thereof, if you knowest?
\q Or who stretched the line upon it?
\q
\v 6 Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened?
\q Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,
\q
\v 7 When the morning stars sang together,
\q And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
\b
\q
\v 8 Or who shut up the sea with doors,
\q When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb;
\q
\v 9 When I made clouds the garment thereof,
\q And thick darkness a swaddling-band for it,
\q
\v 10 And marked out for it my bound,
\q And set bars and doors,
\q
\v 11 And said, Hitherto shall you come, but no further;
\q And here shall your proud waves be stayed?
\b
\q
\v 12 Hast you commanded the morning since your days began,
\q And caused the dayspring to know its place;
\q
\v 13 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,
\q And the wicked be shaken out of it?
\q
\v 14 It is changed as clay under the seal;
\q And all things stand forth as a garment:
\q
\v 15 And from the wicked their light is withholden,
\q And the high arm is broken.
\b
\q
\v 16 Hast you entered into the springs of the sea?
\q Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?
\q
\v 17 Have the gates of death been revealed to thee?
\q Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
\q
\v 18 Hast you comprehended the earth in its breadth?
\q Declare, if you know it all.
\b
\q
\v 19 Where is the way to the dwelling of light?
\q And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
\q
\v 20 That you should take it to the bound thereof,
\q And that you should discern the paths to the house thereof?
\q
\v 21 Doubtless, you knowest, for you was then born,
\q And the number of your days is great!
\q
\v 22 Hast you entered the treasuries of the snow,
\q Or have you seen the treasures of the hail,
\q
\v 23 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,
\q Against the day of battle and war?
\q
\v 24 By what way is the light parted,
\q Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?
\b
\q
\v 25 Who has cleft a channel for the waterflood,
\q Or the way for the lightning of the thunder;
\q
\v 26 To cause it to rain on a land where no man is;
\q On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
\q
\v 27 To satisfy the waste and desolate ground,
\q And to cause the tender grass to spring forth?
\q
\v 28 Hath the rain a father?
\q Or who has begotten the drops of dew?
\q
\v 29 Out of whose womb came the ice?
\q And the hoary frost of heaven, who has gendered it?
\q
\v 30 The waters hide themselves and become like stone,
\q And the face of the deep is frozen.
\b
\q
\v 31 Canst you bind the cluster of the Pleiades,
\q Or loose the bands of Orion?
\q
\v 32 Canst you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season?
\q Or can you guide the Bear with her train?
\q
\v 33 Know you the ordinances of the heavens?
\q Canst you establish the dominion thereof in the earth?
\b
\q
\v 34 Canst you lift up your voice to the clouds,
\q That abundance of waters may cover thee?
\q
\v 35 Canst you send forth lightnings, that they may go,
\q And say to thee, Here we are?
\q
\v 36 Who has put wisdom in the inward parts?
\q Or who has given understanding to the mind?
\q
\v 37 Who can number the clouds by wisdom?
\q Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,
\q
\v 38 When the dust runs into a mass,
\q And the clods cleave fast together?
\b
\q
\v 39 Canst you hunt the prey for the lioness,
\q Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
\q
\v 40 When they couch in their dens,
\q And abide in the covert to lie in wait?
\q
\v 41 Who provideth for the raven his prey,
\q When his young ones cry to God,
\q And wander for lack of food?
