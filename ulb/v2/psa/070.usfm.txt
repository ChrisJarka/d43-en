\c 70
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David; to bring to remembrance.
\q
\v 1 Make haste, O God, to deliver me;
\q Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.
\q
\v 2 Let them be put to shame and confounded
\q That seek after my soul:
\q Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor
\q That delight in my hurt.
\q
\v 3 Let them be turned back by reason of their shame
\q That say, Aha, aha.
\q
\v 4 Let all those that seek you rejoice and be glad in you;
\q And let such as love your salvation say continually,
\q Let God be magnified.
\q
\v 5 But I am poor and needy;
\q Make haste to me, O God:
\q You are my help and my deliverer;
\q O Jehovah, make no tarrying.
