Go to [[https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.8.8.html]] to download the Notepad++ software.


Click on the Green Download button. We suggest that you allow the Installer to run on your computer and to allow the program to run without verifying the publisher. You may need to verify to allow the installer to install the program one more time.


Choose the desired Installation Language. Go through the install approving of changes and making the choices that are presented. 


On the 'Choose Components' window, choose 'Custom' type of installation. No need to check any of the boxes on the second Choose Components window.


The Icon for Notepad++  (a piece of paper with a pencil) will be on the Start Menu of a Windows machine.
