=== What is the Book of Revelation about? ===

Revelation talks about "the end of time." Many commentators understand this to be the entire period of the Christian church, because it has always been under attack. Other interpreters view Revelation's description of events as relating to a more tightly limited period closer to Christ's return to earth. While some of the book gives specific words of [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophecy]] to churches, most of the events described in the book concern the wrath of God being poured out on creation. During this time, the opposition of the antichrist will unfold over a period of seven years. Ultimately, Jesus will be victorious, and all who put their trust in him will live forever with him. This book warns its readers and gives them assurance that God is in control. Eventually, [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] will come to an end.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Revelation,” "The Revelation of Jesus Christ," or "“The Apocalypse of John.” Or they may choose a possibly clearer title, such as “The Things that Jesus Christ Showed to John." (See: [:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Revelation? ===

The book of Revelation was probably written by the apostle John. He wrote the book of Revelation while on the island of Patmos, where he was exiled for preaching the good news about Jesus Christ.

=== What type of writing is the Book of Revelation? ===

John uses many images throughout the book to describe the things he saw, in the style of other pieces of writing classed as apocalyptic literature. Many symbols and events symbolic of other events are usually present in such writing, as well as many dreams and visions. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Are the events of Revelation past or future? ===

Many scholars have very different theories about the Book of Revelation. Some treat the events of the book as symbols, while others treat them as being fulfilled (at least in part) by the destruction of the Jewish temple in AD 70. Others believe that the events of the book are entirely set into the future. It is probable that at least many of the events are still for future fulfillment, and that any fulfillment of these prophecies in the past was either partial or a foreshadowing of what would eventually come. If this is allowed by the project language's preferences, the translator should leave the prophecies in the tense they are found in the ULB. 

=== How does the Book of Revelation relate to the rest of Scripture? ===

While the Book of Revelation is very different than the rest of Scripture, it is rooted in the Old Testament understanding of the end times. Revelation, Daniel, Ezekiel, Zechariah and a number of other books are all thematically related to each other; they form one cohesive account of the end times. Because of their shared imagery and background, it may be beneficial to translate Revelation about the same time that one translates Daniel. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Does one need to understand the Book of Revelation in order to translate it? ===

One does not need to have a definite understanding of the theology of the Book of Revelation in order to properly translate it. Symbols should not be given any possible identification to their meaning. The same holds true for numbers, which have great significance the the Book of Revelation. 

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Revelation? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of Revelation:\\

  * "'I am the Alpha and the Omega,' says the Lord God, 'the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.'" (1:8) The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. Some versions add the phrase "the Beginning and the End."
  * "the elders lay down and worshiped" (5:14). The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. Some older versions have, "the twenty-four elders lay down and worshiped the one who lives forever and ever."
  * "so that a third of it [the earth] was burned up" (8:7). The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. Some older versions omit this phrase.
  * Some manuscripts add the phrase "and who is to come" (11:17). But the ULB, UDB, and most modern versions do not.
  * Some manuscripts add the phrase "before the throne of God" (14:5). But the ULB, UDB, and most modern versions do not.
  * "the one who is and who was, the Holy One" (ULB) (16:5). The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. Some older manuscripts read, "O Lord, The One who is and who was and who is to be."
  * Some manuscripts add the phrase "of those who are saved" (21:24) 
  * "those who wash their robes" (22:14). Some manuscripts read "they who do his commandments"
  * "tree of life" (ULB) (22:19). Some manuscripts read "book of life."

Translators are advised not to translate this phrase. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region have it, it is not wrong to translate it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of Revelation.
