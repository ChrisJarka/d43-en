\p
\v 10 And I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet
together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to kill thee; yea,
in the night will they come to kill thee.
\v 11 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his
life? I will not go in.
