\v 4 The rash will think carefully with understanding, and the studderer will  speak distinctly and with ease.
\v 5 The fool will no longer be  called honorable, nor the deceiver called principled.
\v 6 For the fool speaks folly, and his heart plans evil and godless actions, and   he speaks wrongly against
Jehovah. He lets the  hungry go away empty, and the thirsty he sends away wanting.
