===== Important Terms: =====


    * Joseph
    * Nazareth
    * Galilee
    * Bethlehem
    * Judea
    * David
    * Mary


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **traveled to the town of Bethlehem**  - That is, "went up" in elevation. Bethlehem was higher in elevation than Nazareth.
    * **city of David **- Bethlehem was called a city because of its importance, not its size. This was the birthplace and residence of David before he joined the army of Saul. This town was also the prophesied birthplace of the coming Messiah.
    * **to register with Mary**  - Mary traveled with Joseph from Nazareth. It is likely that women were also taxed, so Mary would have needed to travel and be registered as well.
    * **who was engaged**  - An engaged couple was considered legally married, but there would not have been physical intimacy between them. (See Luke 1:27 translation notes).
    * **expecting a child**  -That is, "was pregnant" or, "with child."
