===== Description =====

In all languages, most **metaphors** fall into broad patterns of associations between ideas. The patterns of associations found in the Bible are often unique to the Hebrew and Greek languages. It is useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems on how to translate them. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere.

For example, one pattern of associations in the Bible is that walking along a path represents behavior. In Psalm 1:1 the image of walking in the advice of the wicked is associated with doing what wicked people say to do.

>Blessed is the man who does not __walk__ in the advice of the wicked (Psalm 1:1)

This pattern is also seen in Psalm 119:32 where running in the path of God's commands refers to doing all that God commands.

> I will __run in the path__ of your commandments. (Psalm 119:32 ULB)






When translators become familiar with these patterns, they will see that many **similes** in the Bible are built on these same associations of ideas. Luke 17:6 has a simile in which the image of a mustard seed is associated with the moral quality of faith.


==== Reasons this is a translation Issue ==== 

These patterns of associating one idea with another present three challenges to anyone who wants to identify them:

(1) When looking at particular metaphors in the Bible, it is not always obvious what two ideas are associated with each other. For example, it may not be immediately obvious that the expression //It is God who puts strength on me like a belt// Ps. 18:32 (ULB) is based on the association of clothing with moral quality. In this case, the image of a belt represents strength. (See: "Clothing represents a moral quality" in [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_manmade]])

(2) When looking at a particular expression, the translator needs to know whether or not it is an image for something else. This can only be done by considering the surrounding text. The surrounding text shows us for example, whether “lamp” refers concretely to a container with oil and a wick for giving light or whether "lamp" is an image  that represents life. (See: "FIRE or LAMP represents life" in [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_phenom]]). 

In Isaiah 42:1-3 below, the fact that that God's servant will bring justice shows that this passage is talking about people, not ordinary lamps. A dimly burning lamp is an image for a person who is in danger of dying.

> Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen one, in him I take delight. I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring justice to the nations. He will not cry out nor shout, nor make his voice heard in the streets. A crushed reed he will not break, and __a dimly burning wick he will not quench__: he will faithfully execute justice. (Isaiah 42:3 ULB)

(3) Expressions that are based on these associations of ideas frequently combine together in complex ways. Moreover, they frequently combine with—and in some cases are based on—common metonymies and cultural models.  (See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part2]] and [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part3]].) For example, in 2 Samuel 14:7 "the burning coal" is an image for the life of the son, who represents what will cause people to remember his father. So there are two patterns of association here: the association of the image of the burning coal with the life of the son, and the association of the son with the memory of his father.

>They say, 'Hand over the man who struck his brother, so that we may put him to death, to pay for the life of his brother whom he killed.’ And so they would also destroy the heir. Thus they will put out __the burning coal__ that I have left, and they will leave for __my husband neither name nor descendant__ on the surface of the earth. 2 Sam. 14:7 (ULB)

==== Translation Principles ==== 

When people talk about things using their own patters of associations, people in those cultures do not tend to think of those associations as being figurative. They are just using their normal way of speaking about those things. If your language does not have a certain pattern that you find in the Bible and you use that pattern in your translation, you may create a startling figure of speech that was not intended in the original text. So instead of using the association, it is sometimes better to simply use your own culture's way of speaking about something.

However, sometimes an association is used extensively in a text, and removing that association would cause much of the meaning to be lost. In this case it is important to keep the association. If it would be hard for readers to understand or believe the text because the association is so strange to them, it can help to prepare them for it by changing a metaphor to a simile. The simile keeps the same association of ideas, but it weakens the link between them. Instead of saying that one thing is the other, it says that one thing is "like" the other.

[[Jim, it seems like it would be good to have examples for both of these principles so people can understand what we're talking about, but this page is getting quite long.]]
