\v 21 Even though many people habitually call me Lord, pretending that they have my authority, God will not agree to rule over some of them, because they do not do what he desires. My Father will agree to rule over only those who do what he wants.
\v 22 On the day that God judges everyone, many people will say to me, â€˜Lord, we spoke God's message as your representatives! As your representatives we drove out demons from people! And as your representatives, many times we performed miracles!'
\v 23 Then I will publicly say to them, 'I have never admitted that you belonged to me. Go away from me, you who do what is evil!'"

\v 21 Not every one who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but only whoever does the will of my
Father who is in heaven.
\v 22 Many people will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, in your name drive out demons, and in your
name do many miracles?'
\v 23 And then will I openly declare to them, 'I never knew you! Depart from me, you who do iniquity!'"
