<usfm> \v 21 For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way! At the head of the two ways, so he might have a vision of the oracle. He shakes arrows and asks of the idols. He examines the liver! \q \v 22 In his right hand was the oracle concerning Jerusalem, to set battering rams! To open the mouth in the slaughter! \q To lift up the voice in a war cry! To set battering rams against the gates! \q To pour out earthen mounds! To build up siege walls! \q \v 23 It will seem to be an empty oracle in their eyes, \q to the ones who had sworn an oath to them! But he will bring iniquity to remembrance to besiege them! </usfm>
