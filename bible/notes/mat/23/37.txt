You killed them by throwing stones at them \f + \ft doublet \f*! Many times I wanted to gather you together \add to protect you\add*, like a hen gathers her young chicks under her wings \f + \ft metaphor \f*. But you did not want \add me to do that\add*.
\v 38 So listen to this: Your city \f + \ft synecdoche \f* will become an uninhabited place.
\v 39 Keep this in mind: You will see me again only when I \add return\add*, and you say \add about me\add*, '\add God\add* is truly pleased with this man who comes with God's authority \f + \ft metonymy \f*.'"

\v 37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent to her! how often would I have
gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!
\v 38 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
\v 39 For I say to you, You shall not see me henceforth, till you shall say, Blessed
is he that comes in the name of the Lord.
