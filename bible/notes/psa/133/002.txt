\q
\v 2 It is like the precious oil upon the head,
\q That ran down upon the beard,
\q Even Aaronâ€™s beard;
\q That came down upon the skirt of his garments;
\q
\v 3 Like the dew of Hermon,
\q That comes down upon the mountains of Zion:
\q For there Jehovah commanded the blessing,
\q Even life for evermore.
