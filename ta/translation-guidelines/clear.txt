====== Creating Clear Translations ======

There are several things involved with making a clear translation from the source text into your language. I will list them here and we will look deeper into each of them.

  * You will need to check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.
  * Be sure you understand who is doing the action.  A clear translation will identify the subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it.
  * You will need to change each EVENT idea into an active clause. 
  * Change passive verbs to the active form.  
  * You will also look at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the possessive construction.

**Let us start with “check the pronouns”.**\\
You will need to check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.
Pronouns are words that stand in the place of a noun or a noun phrase. They refer back to something that has already been mentioned. 

In this sentence; 

“The boy ate his dinner.” 

‘boy’ is the noun and ‘his’ is a pronoun that refers back to the boy. (For more information see the Translation Academy page on English Sentence Structure and Parts of Speech.)

Confusion can arise if it is not clear to whom or what a particular pronoun refers. Compare the following translations of Mark 9:20-21.
Reading from the Unfolding Word Literal Bible: **And __they__ brought __him__ to __him__: and when __he__ saw __him__, straightway the spirit shook __him__ severely; and __he__ fell on the ground foaming at the mouth. And __he__ asked __his__ father, “How long time has __he__ been like this?” And __he__ said, “From a child.”
**
__The pronouns are underlined.__

Is it immediately clear who or what each pronoun refers to?  It may not be clear to the reader.  Each language has its own pattern of pronoun reference. Therefore, to avoid confusion, you may sometimes need to use a noun in the translation where the source text has a pronoun.

REMEMBER:  Always check carefully that it is clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.

**Next you need to understand who is doing the action.  Check each abstract noun, also known as the EVENT idea, or passive verb form to be sure you understand who is doing the action.** 

A good translation will identify the person, or subject, who is doing the action and the person or thing, the object, that has the action done to them or it.  

The PARTICIPANTS in an event are the people or things which take part in that event. When re-expressing an EVENT idea as a verb, it is often necessary to state who or what are the PARTICIPANTS in that event. Usually this will be clear from the context.

Consider the action of this statement:  **The dog ate the meat.**
In this sentence the //dog// is the //Subject//. The //meat// is the //Object// and //ate// is the //Action//.

Since the PARTICIPANTS in an event are the people or things which take part in that event. The dog and the meat are the Participants.  The EVENT is ate.

Matthew 24 verse 31 states: ….gather his elect from the four winds.

Consider the implied action of the noun phrase of ‘his elect.’\\
This phrase could be re-stated as:  --->  the people whom (God) has chosen

Since the PARTICIPANTS in an event are the people or things which take part in that event. God and people are the Participants.  The EVENT is chosen, the past tense of to choose.

REMEMBER: A clear translation will identify the PARTICIPANTS. The subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it. 

Now let us look at the next item:

**You will need to change each EVENT idea into an active clause to be sure it is understood.**  Later, if your language will allow you to change active verbs into EVENT ideas, try to use the noun form. 

James chapter 4 verse 9 states, “Let your laughter be turned to mourning …”

The nouns, (laughter, mourning) in this example are actually EVENT ideas in the passage. 
This could be re-expressed:  “Don’t laugh any more, instead begin to mourn or weep”

Notice the noun in the first version is replaced in the simpler version with a verb.

1 Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 15 says, “until the coming of the Lord, . . .”
This could be re-expressed:  “until the Lord comes”

When preparing to translate, it is helpful to look for any EVENT ideas in the passage, especially those which are expressed by some form other than a verb. See if you can re-express the meaning using a verb to express the EVENT idea. This is useful for two reasons:

1. It helps to reveal more precisely the meaning of the source text. The meaning, especially the relationships between ideas, often appears more clearly when the EVENT ideas are expressed as verbs.

2. Often this restructuring will help the translator to find an easier way to express the meaning in the Target Language.

Now let us look at the next item:\\

**For each passive verb you find in the text, identify the active form as well as the subject and object of the verb.  Re-express any passive verbs in the active form. ** 

For each passive verb you find in the text, identify the active form as well as the subject and object of the verb.  Re-express any passive verbs in the active form.

In English it is possible to say “John built the house” (active form) or “The house was built by John.” (passive form)

In the ACTIVE form, the subject of the sentence is the person who does the action. 
In the PASSIVE form, the subject of the sentence is the person or thing to which the action is done. Someone else, who is not necessarily named, does the action to that person or thing. 

Many languages do not have a passive form, only the active form exists. Therefore, in translating from English it may be necessary to turn a sentence from the passive form into the active form. See the lesson on Active and Passive for more information.

Consider Mark 1:13 //Jesus was tempted by Satan// [passive form]
This may need to be re-expressed: Satan tempted Jesus.

In the passive form, the person who does the action is not always mentioned.  In the active form, the person who does the action is always mentioned.  Therefore, in turning a passive form into an active form, it is sometimes necessary to make explicit (that is, to state openly) who did the action.  Quite often the subject “God” has to be supplied.  For example:

Colossians 1:11 //May you be strengthened with all power.// --->  May (God) strengthen you with all power.

Finally, we will look at the last point:\\
**You will also need to look at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the possessive construction.** 

Look at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the possessive construction.  In many languages, “of” constructions are not as frequent as they are in English and Greek.  Study the meaning of each one and re-express the meaning of the phrase in a way which makes the relationship between the parts clear.  Re-express all EVENT ideas as verbs.

For example, consider the phrase “the love of God”.  Does this mean “someone’s love for God” or “God’s love for someone”?  Often if you take a phrase alone, it is not clear what the meaning is. It could be understood in more than one way. But if you study the context in which it occurs, the correct meaning becomes clear. 

An examination of the context of each of the following passages shows that:

in Romans 8:39   ‘the love of God’ means “God’s love for us”, or “how God loves us”
in 1 John 5:3   ‘the love of God’ means “our love for God” or “how we love God”.

At first sight the two phrases appear identical. But when the contexts in which they occur are studied, it becomes clear that they are different.

So the 5 points to remember when translating to keep the translation clear are:
  * Check the pronouns
  * Understand the action
  * Change event idea to active
  * Re-express passive verbs
  * Look at each ‘of’ phrase

The goal of accurate translations is to translate the meaning of the original message clearly, accurately and naturally, keeping the author’s main focus in mind.  

**Word for Word Substitution**  - Literal translations, or word for word substitution, is not the best choice for doing excellent translations because they look only at individual words in the text, result in awkward text, may contain improper grammar, and presents an unclear or wrong meaning in the target text.
