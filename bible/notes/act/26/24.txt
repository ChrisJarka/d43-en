\v 25 But Paul answered, "Your Excellency, Festus, I am not raving insanely! On the contrary, what I am saying is true and quite  sanesensible!

\v 24 And as Paul completed his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, 'Paul, you are insane; your great learning makes you insane.'
\v 25 But Paul said, I am not insane, most excellent Festus; but with courage I speak words of truth and soberness*.
\v 26 For the king knows about these things; and so, I speak freely to him, for I am persuaded that none of this is hidden from him; for this has not been done in a corner.
25 But he said, “I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness. 26 For the king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner. 27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.” 28 Agrippa said to Paul, “With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?” 29 Paul said, “I pray to God, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me today, might become such as I am, except for these bonds.” 30 The king rose up with the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them. 31 When they had withdrawn, they spoke to one another, saying, “This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.” 32 Agrippa said to Festus, “This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”
