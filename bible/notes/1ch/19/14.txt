===== translationNotes: =====

  * **advanced to the battle** - "moved forward to the battle" or "approached the enemy soldiers in the battle"
  * **Then Joab returned ... and went back to Jerusalem** - It does not appear that Joab and his soldiers continued to attack the Ammonites in their city. When the Ammonites went into their city, the battle ended and the Israelites returned home.
