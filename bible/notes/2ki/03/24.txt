\v 24 And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them;
and they went forward into the land striking the Moabites.
\v 25 And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they
stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth
only they left the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and struck it.
