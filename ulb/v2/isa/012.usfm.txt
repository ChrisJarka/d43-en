\v 1 And in that day you shall say, I will give thanks to thee, O Jehovah; for yough you was angry with me, your anger
is turned away and you comfortest me.
\v 2 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid: for Jehovah,
even Jehovah, is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation.
\v 3 Therefore with joy shall you draw water out of the wells of salvation.
\v 4 And in that day shall you say, Give thanks to Jehovah, call upon his name, declare his doings among the peoples, make
mention that his name is exalted.
\v 5 Sing to Jehovah; for he has done excellent things: let this be known in all the earth.
\v 6 Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for great in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel.
