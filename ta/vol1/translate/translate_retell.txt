===== Re-telling the Meaning =====

This module answers the question: How do I te-tell the Meaning?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: ['translate_process']

Compare the meaning in the Target Language translation with the meaning in the Original Language.

==== Source Language may not be Accurate ====
If the translator does not understand the Original Language they must use a Source Language. The meaning in the source may be correct, depending on how carefully it was translated from the original. But it is still an intermediate version. In some cases, the source may have actually been translated from another source, rather than from the original.\\
Consider the example below. A translator uses a Swahili NT as the source for a new language version. However, the particular Swahili Bible version he is using was actually translated from English â€” not directly from the Greek (Original Language)!

The only way to make sure the translation is accurate is to compare the new translation with the original language. Use the ULB when it is not possible to use a source text in the original language. 






Next we recommend you learn about: ['translate_terms', 'translate_discover', 'translate_literal', 'translate_dynamic']
