\v 10 Lot looked toward the town of Zoar and saw that there was plenty of water all over the plain near the Jordan River. This was before Yahweh destroyed the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah which were on that plain. In those days, it was like the garden of Yahweh, like the land in Egypt near the Nile River.
\v 11 So Lot chose for himself the land in the plain of the Jordan River. He left his uncle, Abram, and moved east.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **east**  - or "in the direction of the east" or "eastward."
  * **the whole plain of the Jordan**  - this refers to the general region of the Jordan River.
  * **was well-watered**  - means "had supplies of clean water"
  * **like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt**  - "like the garden of Yahweh or like the land of Egypt". These were in two different places.
  * **garden**  - Use the same word for "garden" as you used in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:02:07]].
  * **This was before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah**  - This anticipates a part of the story that will be told later in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:19:23]]. It is important here because it explains why Lot settled in a region that was later not fertile.
  * **the relatives**  - "the kinsmen" or "the families". This refers primarily to Lot and Abram.
  * **bold words**  - explanation
