====== Acts 14 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "The message of his grace" ==
The gospel message is one centered upon the [[:en:obe:kt:grace|grace]] of God. It is the message: God will show grace and [[:en:obe:kt:mercy|mercy]] to those who [[:en:obe:kt:believe|believe]] in Jesus. 

== Zeus and Hermes ==
The Gentiles in the ancient Near East worshipped many different [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|false gods]]. They are contrasted with the "living God," Yahweh, because they have no power.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "It is through many sufferings that we must enter into the kingdom of God" ==
Suffering itself cannot lead to [[:en:obe:kt:save|salvation]]. Scholars are divided over how to understand this passage. Some believe that suffering accompanies salvation and one should equate the phrase entering the [[:en:obe:kt:kingdomofgod|kingdom of God]] with [[:en:obe:kt:eternity|eternal]] life. Others do not wish to equate these terms, and see that suffering earn a person [[:en:obe:kt:reward|rewards]] in the future kingdom of God.
