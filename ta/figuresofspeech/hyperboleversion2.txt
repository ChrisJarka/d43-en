====== Hyperbole [hīˈpərbəlē] ======

A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker’s feeling or opinion about something.

=====Purposes of Hyperbole =====
=====Examples from English =====

“I’ve told you __a million times__ not to do that” means “I've told you __too many__ times not to do that.”\\ 
“I’m __starving__. I haven’t eaten anything since early morning” means “I'm __too hungry__. I want something to eat now. I haven't eaten since early morning.”\\ 
“It took __forever__ for him to finish the job” means “It took him __too long__ to finish the job.”

=====Examples from the Bible =====

//When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.// Luke 4:40 (WEB)\\ 
Luke wrote that __all__ brought their sick ones to Jesus. This is a hyperbole. Probably not everyone did this. But many did. The hyperbole helps to show how excited people were that Jesus could heal them.

//When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.// Luke 5:11 (WEB)\\ 
Luke wrote that when Jesus invited some fishermen to follow him, they left everything. We know that they left their fishing business. Saying that they left "everything" may be a case of hyperbole to emphasize that now they were completely committed to following Jesus.

//Then Jesus said to them, “I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?”// Luke 6:9 (WEB)\\ 
Jesus asked the leaders if they were permitted to save a person's life or "destroy" it on the day of rest. When he asked about destroying life, this was hyperbole. He was talking about allowing a person to continue in their suffering by refusing to heal them.

//You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake.// Luke 21:17 (WEB)\\ 
When Jesus said that "everyone" would hate his followers, he meant that most people would hate his followers. He said “everyone” to emphasize how difficult things would be for his followers.

//If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire,// Mark 9:43a (WEB)\\ 
Jesus told people to cut off their hand if it caused them to sin. He meant that they we should do whatever we need to do in order not to sin. He used this hyperbole to show how extremely important it is to stop sinning.

//“If anyone comes to me, and doesn’t hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he can’t be my disciple.// Luke 14:26 (WEB)\\ 
Jesus said that if we do not hate our family members and ourselves, we cannot follow him. When he said "hate", that was hyperbole. He meant that we must not love them more than we love him, that they should not be more important to us than he is, that we must put him first.

// You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.// Mark 13:13a (WEB)\\ 
Jesus said that “everyone” would hate his followers. This was hyperbole. He meant that “most people” would hate his followers. He said “everyone” to emphasize how difficult things would be for his followers.

//For from you has sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth; so that we need not to say anything.// 1 Thes 1:8 (WEB)
Paul wrote that people __in every ____place__ were talking about the Thessalonians. This is an example of hyperbole. He meant that people in “many far away places” were talking about them. Paul probably used this hyperbole to show how happy he was that the Thessalonians’ faith in God was so great that many people had heard about it.
