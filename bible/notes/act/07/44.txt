\v 44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, just as God commanded when he spoke to Moses, that he should make it like the pattern that he had seen.
\v 45 Later, our fathers, under Joshua, received the tabernacle and brought it with them when they took possession of the land. God forced those nations—before the face of our fathers—to leave the land. The tabernacle remained in the land until the time of David,
\v 46 who found favor in the sight of God, and he asked if he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.

  * **the tabernacle of the testimony** - The tent that housed the ark (a box) with the 10 commandments carved in stone inside it
  * **our fathers, under Joshua, received the tabernacle and brought it with them** - The phrase "under Joshua" means that their ancestors did these things in obedience to Joshua's direction. AT: "our fathers, in accordance with Joshua's instructions, received the tabernacle and brought it with them"
  * **those nations** - This refers to the people who lived in the land before Israel. AT: "the people who previously lived here" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **God forced those nations—before the face of our fathers—to leave the land** - This sentence tells how the ancestors were able to take possession of the land. Here "the face of our fathers" refers to the presence of their ancestors. Possible meanings are 1) "As our ancestors watched, God forced those nations to leave the land" or 2) "When our ancestors came, God forced those nations to leave the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
