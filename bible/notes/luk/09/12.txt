\v 12 And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, Send the crowds that they may go into
the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.
\v 13 But he said to them, Give you them something to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we
should go and buy food for all this people.
\v 14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.
