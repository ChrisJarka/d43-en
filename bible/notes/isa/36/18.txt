===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Has any of the gods of the peoples rescued them from of the power of the king of Assyria?** - The Bible also teaches about false “gods” which are nonliving idols that people wrongly worship. Assyria had defeated other nations around Judah.  The idols these nations worshiped did not protect them. AT: "Do not allow Hezekiah to trick you by saying, "Yahweh will rescue us. The gods that people of other nations worship have never rescued any of them from the power of the king of Assyria!" UDB (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
     * **from of the power of the king of Assyria?** - "Power of the king of Assyria" refers to the strength the Assyrian army.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
     * **Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my power?** - The Rabshakeh reminds Jewish officials that gods of other nations have not saved them from the Assyrian army. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) "My power" refers to the strength the Assyrian army.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
     * **Hamath...Arpad...Sepharvaim** - See how you translated these cities in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:10:07|Isa 10:09]]. These are all names of cities located in northern Syria, northeast of Jerusalem. (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]])
    * **as if Yahweh could save Jerusalem from my power?"** - "My power" refers to the strength the Assyrian army.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) Rabshakeh does not believe that Yahweh can protect Judah since the Assyrian army was able to conquer adjacent  nations. AT: "Yahweh can not save you from my power!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
