\v 5 For who will have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who will bemoan thee? or who will turn aside to ask of your welfare?
\v 6 You have rejected me, says Jehovah, you are gone backward: therefore have I stretched out my hand against thee, and
destroyed thee; I am weary with repenting.
\v 7 And I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land; I have bereaved
them of children, I have destroyed my people; they returned not from their ways.
