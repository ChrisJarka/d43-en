===== Use of Notes =====

These questions will help the church community know more about how the book was translated and if the translator was able to use the notes faithfully.

Q? Were the notes provided for the translation adequate for you to make a clear translation?  (Was the translator satisfied that the exegetical notes made the message clear for them to translate?)

Q? List any passages where you needed more help to understand the meaning of the text, and tell where you found that help.  (Explain what was difficult to understand.)

Q? What passages in this book are still difficult for you to understand, and where would you like additional consultant help?  (How can the church leaders add some insight from their theological background?)
