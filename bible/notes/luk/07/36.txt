\v 36 Now a certain Pharisee was requesting that Jesus eat with him. And so after Jesus entered into the Pharisee’s house, he reclined at the table to eat. 
\v 37 Now there was a certain woman in the city who was a sinner. And having found out that he was reclining in the Pharisee’s house, having brought an alabaster flask of perfume,
\v 38 and having stood behind him near his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and was wiping them with the hairs of her head, and was kissing his feet, and anointing them with perfume.
