===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 He will punish especially severely those who do what they themselves want to do, things that make them displeasing to God. They boldly do whatever they wish to do; they even insult God's powerful angels.
\v 11 Unlike those people, God's angels insult no one in front of him, not even them!
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 This is especially true for those who continue in the corrupt desires of the flesh and despise authority. They are bold and self-willed. They are not afraid to blaspheme the glorious ones.
\v 11 Angels have greater strength and ability than all men, but they do not bring not insulting judgments against them to the Lord.
