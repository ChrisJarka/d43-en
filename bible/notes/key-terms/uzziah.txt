====== Uzziah ======

===== Facts: =====

Uzziah became king of Judah around 800 B.C. at 16 years old and reigned 52 years in Jerusalem, unusually long.

  * Ussiah's wise men designed towers with "engines of war" to hurl arrows and large stones to defend the city.
  * Uzziah generally served the Lord until late in his career when he inappropriately burned incense in the temple,  suffered leprosy and had to be isolated the rest of his reign.
