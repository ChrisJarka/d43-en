===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **proclaiming and preaching - **
    * **the Twelve - **  These are the twelve men he had selected to be his special helpers in Luke 6:12-16. They are here distinguished from his disciples in general, which was a much larger number.
    * **Mary who was called Magdalene**  - That is, Mary from the town of Magdala.
    * **Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward**  - This could also be translated as "Joanna, the wife of Herod's steward, Chuza." Joanna was Chuza's wife, and Chuza was Herod's steward.
    * **steward**  - He was one of Herod's servants. His job was to manage Herod's property. (Please correct this if I'm off about the role of the steward.)
