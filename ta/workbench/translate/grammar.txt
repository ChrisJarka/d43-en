===== Speech Quotations =====

Some languages have both direct and indirect quotations.

  * **DIRECT** quotations are when someone reports someone else’s speech the way the other person would have said it. (She said, “Come.” and then he said, “I will come.”) 
  * **INDIRECT quotations are when someone reports basically what another person said but from his own perspective (using his own words). (She told him to come. He said he would come.)
