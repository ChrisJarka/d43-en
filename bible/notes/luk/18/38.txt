===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **cried out**  - "called out" or "shouted"
  * **Son of David**  - Jesus was a descendant of David, Israel's most important king. The phrase is used here of Jesus of Nazareth as a royal title for the anointed king that would come to Israel. The blind man's address is on the same level as Peter's confession in Mt. 16:16.
  * **have mercy on me**  - "show me pity" or "show me compassion"
  * **And the ones**  - "And the people"
  * **be quiet**  - "be silent" or "do not talk"
