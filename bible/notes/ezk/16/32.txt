====== Ezekiel 16:32-34 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 You are like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a woman who commits adultery: You prefer to \add have sex with\add* strangers rather than with your husband.
\v 33 Prostitutes are paid, but \add it is as though\add* you give gifts to all your lovers; you bribe them to come to you from everywhere to have sex with you.
\v 34 So although you act like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a prostitute, you are not like other prostitutes: no one needs to request you to have sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with them. You are the opposite of other prostitutes; instead of them giving any money to you, you give men money to have sex with you.

\v 33 Prostitutes are paid, but it is as though you give gifts to all your lovers; you bribe them to come to you from everywhere to have sex with you.
\v 34 So although you act like you are a prostitute, you are actually the opposite of other prostitutes! Instead of them giving any money to you, you give men money to have sex with you!

<usfm>
\v 32 You adulterous woman, you accept strangers instead of your husband!
\v 33 People give payment to every prostitute, but you give your wages to all your lovers and bribe them to come to you from all around for your acts of prostitution.
\v 34 So there is a difference between you and those other women, since no one goes to you to ask you to sleep with them. Instead, you pay them! No one pays you.'
