===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Though they hide on the top of Carmel ... Though they are hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea** - Yahweh gives an exaggerated image of the people fleeing to the top of mount Carmel or to the bottom of the sea to escape being killed. Here "top of Carmel" and "bottom of the sea" are a merism that represents all places. AT: "Even if they were to hide on the top of Carmel ... Even if they tried to go the bottom sea, thinking that I could not see them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **serpent** - an unknown fierce sea animal, not the snake in the garden of Eden and not a common snake
  * **Though they go into captivity, driven by their enemies before them** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Though enemies capture them and force them to go to a foreign land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **there will I give orders to the sword, and it will kill them** - Here "sword" represents their enemies. AT: "there I will cause their enemies to kill them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will keep my eyes on them for harm and not for good** - Here "eyes" represents seeing. The phrase "keep my eyes on them" is an idiom that means to watch closely. AT: "I will watch closely and make sure only bad things happen to them and not good things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
