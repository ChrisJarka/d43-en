====== Proverbs 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapter 2 continues a collection of proverbs that ends in chapter nine. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Parallelism ==

Proverbs are often written without any surrounding context and in two lines of text. Each line will have a certain relationship to the other line. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Many of the proverbs are stated as promises but are intended to be advice. 

== My Son ==
Occasionally the author addresses a proverb to my son. This is not intended to restrict the words of that proverb to only males but is still given in the context of a father warning his son.
