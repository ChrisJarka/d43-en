====== written ======

===== Definition: =====

The phrase "As it is written" or "what is written" occurs frequently in the New Testament and usually refers to commands or prophecies that were written in the Hebrew scriptures.

  * Sometimes "As it is written" refers to what was written in the Law of Moses.
  * Other times it is a quote from what one of the prophets wrote in the Old Testament.
  * This could be translated: "As it is written in the Law of Moses" or "As the prophets wrote long ago" or "As it says in God's laws that Moses wrote down long ago".
  * Another option is to keep "It is written" and give a footnote that explains what this means.
