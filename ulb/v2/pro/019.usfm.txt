\c 19
\q
\v 1 Better is the poor that walks in his integrity
\q Than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool.
\q
\v 2 Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good;
\q And he that hastens with his feet sinneth.
\q
\v 3 The foolishness of man subverteth his way;
\q And his heart fretteth against Jehovah.
\q
\v 4 Wealth adds many friends;
\q But the poor is separated from his friend.
\q
\v 5 A false witness shall not be unpunished;
\q And he that utters lies shall not escape.
\q
\v 6 Many will entreat the favor of the liberal man;
\q And every man is a friend to him that gives gifts.
\q
\v 7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him:
\q How much more do his friends go far from him!
\q He pursueth them with words, but they are gone.
\q
\v 8 He that gets wisdom loves his own soul:
\q He that keeps understanding shall find good.
\q
\v 9 A false witness shall not be unpunished;
\q And he that utters lies shall perish.
\q
\v 10 Delicate living is not seemly for a fool;
\q Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.
\q
\v 11 The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger;
\q And it is his glory to pass over a transgression.
\q
\v 12 The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion;
\q But his favor is as dew upon the grass.
\q
\v 13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father;
\q And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.
\q
\v 14 House and riches are an inheritance from fathers;
\q But a prudent wife is from Jehovah.
\q
\v 15 Slothfulness throws into a deep sleep;
\q And the idle soul shall suffer hunger.
\q
\v 16 He that keeps the commandment keeps his soul;
\q But he that is careless of his ways shall die.
\q
\v 17 He that has pity upon the poor lends to Jehovah,
\q And his good deed will he pay him again.
\q
\v 18 Chasten your son, seeing there is hope;
\q and set not your heart on his destruction.
\q
\v 19 A man of great wrath shall bear the penalty;
\q For if you deliver him, you must do it yet again.
\q
\v 20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction,
\q That you may be wise in your latter end.
\q
\v 21 There are many devices in a man’s heart;
\q But the counsel of Jehovah, that shall stand.
\q
\v 22 That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness;
\q And a poor man is better than a liar.
\q
\v 23 The fear of Jehovah tendeth to life;
\q And he that has it shall abide satisfied;
\q He shall not be visited with evil.
\q
\v 24 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish,
\q And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
\q
\v 25 Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;
\q And reprove one that has understanding, and he will understand knowledge.
\q
\v 26 He that does violence to his father, and chaseth away his mother,
\q Is a son that causes shame and brings reproach.
\q
\v 27 Cease, my son, to hear instruction
\q Only to err from the words of knowledge.
\q
\v 28 A worthless witness mocketh at justice;
\q And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.
\q
\v 29 Judgments are prepared for scoffers,
\q And stripes for the back of fools.
