To help translators make the best translation possible, translation helps have been created. The resources include the Unlocked Dynamic Bible, translationNotes, translationWords, and translationQuestions.

==== Translation Resources in translationStudio ====

Click on the **Check** icon that looks like a clipboard with a check mark. In the right column there are tabs with the following words: Notes, Words, Questions and UDB.

Click on the word "Notes" for the translationNotes. The words or phrases are listed as they appear in the story or in the ULB. Tap on the phrase for help in understanding how to translate that phrase into the target language. The **translationNotes** are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain the context in which the stories from Open Bible Stories and the Bible was written as well as inform the translator of translation options available to them. See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:resources_types]] for information about the types of notes.

Click on the word "Words" for the translationWords. The words are listed as they appear in the story on in the ULB. The **translationWords** are important terms found in Open Bible Stories and the Bible. It is crucial that they be translated correctly. Each translationWord has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places that term is used in Open Bible Stories and the Bible to ensure that it has been translated correctly there, too.

Click on the word "Questions" for the translationQuestions. The questions are about information as it appears in the story on in the ULB. Read the question and answer it according to the translated text. Click on the question for the expected answer. If the given answer and the expected answer are the same then the translation might be clear and accurate.

Click on the initials "UDB" for the Unlocked Dynamic Bible. It will open at the same spot that you are in the ULB. Read the text. Perhaps the UDB is clearer to understand for this chunk.


Once you have consulted the translation helps, then you are ready to make the best translation.

**Please use the translation helps when checking your translation!**
