\v 7 \add I refused to accept money\add* from you as pay for teaching you God's message about Christ.

\v 8 \add Some people might say that it was as though\add* \f + \ft irony \f* I was robbing other congregations because I accepted money from them in order that I might work among you.
\v 9 Furthermore, when I was \add there\add* with you and had no \add money to buy the things that I needed\add*, I did not cause any difficulty to any \add of you\add* \add by depending on you\f + \ft Or: by asking you for money, Or: support\add* \f*, because our\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* fellow believers who came from \add here in\add* Macedonia \add province\add* brought enough \add money for me to buy everything\add* that I needed.

\v 7 Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you for nothing?
\v 8 I robbed other churches, taking support from them so that I could serve you;
\v 9 and when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone; for after coming from Macedonia, the brothers supplied what I was lacking.
And in every way I kept and will continue to keep myself from being a burden to you.
