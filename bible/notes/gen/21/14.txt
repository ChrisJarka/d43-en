\v 14 Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and gave her the child, and sent her away.  She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
\v 15 When the water in the bottle was gone,  she abandoned the child under one of the bushes.
\v 16 Then she went, and sat down acrosss from him, about  the distance of a bowshot away, for she said, "Let me not look upon the death of the child." As she sat there across from him she lifted up her voice and wept.
