\q
\add You consider that\add* the non-Jewish groups are not nations at all \f + \ft chiasmus \f*. But some of them  \add will believe in me, and I will bless them\add*. Then you will envy them. I will cause you to be angry with those people whom  \add you Jews think\add* do not understand  \add my ways\add* \f + \ft irony \f*.

\v 19 Furthermore, it is true that the Israelites really did hear this message. They understood it, too, but they refused to believe it. Remember that Moses was the first one to warn the people like this. He told them that God said,

"You think that the non-Jewish nations are not real nations at all. But some of them will believe in me, and I will bless them. Then you will envy them and be angry at them, people who you do not think understand me.

\v 19 Moreover, I say, "Did Israel not know?" First Moses says,
\q "I will provoke you to jealousy by what is not a nation.
\q By means of a nation without understanding, I will stir you up to anger."
