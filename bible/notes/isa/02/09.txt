===== Translation Notes: =====

In 2:9 Isaiah was speaking to God. In 2:10-11 Isaiah was speaking to the people.

  * **The common man bows down and the great man bows low before them**  - The phrases "common man" and "great man" used together means "all people." Alternate translation: "From the common person to the great person, everyone bows down before idols." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:merism|Merism]])
  * **therefore do not forgive them**  - Here Isaiah is talking to Yahweh.
  * **Enter into the rocky places**  - Here Isaiah is again talking to the people of Judah.
  * **hide in the dust**  - "hide in the holes in the ground"
  * **from before the terror of Yahweh**  - Alternate translations: "to get away from Yahweh's terrifying presence" or "from Yahweh because you will be extremely afraid of him"
  * **the glory of his majesty**  - Alternate translation: "his awesome power" or "his great power"
  * **The lofty gaze of man will be brought low, and the pride of men will be brought down**  - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. This could be translated with an active verb: “He will make every prideful person humble." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:doublet|Doublet]] and [[:en:ta:translate:active|Active or Passive]])
  * **and Yahweh alone will be exalted**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "and people will praise only Yahweh."
  * **on that day** - This refers to the time when Yahweh will judge all people. Translation alternate: “on the day that Yahweh comes to judge everyone.” (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
