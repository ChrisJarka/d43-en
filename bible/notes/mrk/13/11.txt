\v 11 When people arrest you, do not worry before that happens about what you will say. Instead, say what God puts into your mind at that time. Then it will not be just you who will be speaking. It will be the Holy Spirit who will be speaking through you.
\v 12 Brothers will betray their brothers and sisters. Fathers will betray their children.  Children will betray their parents so that the government will kill their parents.
\v 13 You will be hated by most people because you believe in me. But all you who continue to trust in me until your life is finished will be saved.

\v 11 When they arrest you and hand you over, do not be concerned or practice what you should say. In that hour, say whatever is given to you to say because it will not be you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
\v 12 Brother hand over brother, and the father his child. Children will rise up against their parents and condemn them to death.
\v 13 And you will be hated by everyone because of my name, but the one who endures to the end will be saved.
