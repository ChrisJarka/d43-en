\v 4 Now consider how great this man was, to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.
\v 5 And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priestâ€™s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham:
\v 6 but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes of Abraham, and has blessed him that has the promises.
