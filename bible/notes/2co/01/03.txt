\v 3 We praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christâ€”he is the Father and from him pour out every kind gift from him, when all we deserve was his fierce anger. And he is the God who gives us all the comfort there is.
\v 4 God comforts us when we go through every painful trial. His comfort heals our lives and even while it heals us, we are able to give away that comfort, to help other people who are suffering, so they can get through their own painful trials.
