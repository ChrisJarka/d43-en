====== Personification ======

Personification is a figure of speech in which someone speaks of something as if it could do what animals or humans can do.
===== Examples of Personification from the Bible =====

**Does not Wisdom call out? Does not Understanding raise her voice?** Proverbs 8:1  \\ 
The author speaks of wisdom and understanding as if it is a woman who calls out to teach people. 
 
**The wild animals of the field will honor me, the jackals and the ostriches.**  Isaiah 43:20 \\ 
God speaks of animals as if they could honor him by what they do or say. 
 
**Discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you.** Proverbs 2:11 \\ 
The author speaks of discretion and understanding as if they could watch over and guard you. A person who has discretion and understanding will be safe. 

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Use the personification if it would be understood correctly.
  * Use the words “like” or “as” to show that the sentences is not to be understood literally. See the example given below from Genesis 4.
  * If it would not be understood correctly, find a way to translate it without the personification. See the example given below from Matthew 8.
===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Therefore also __the wisdom of God said__, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,** Luke 11:49 (WEB)\\
Here God's wisdom is personified as if it could speak.

**No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. __You can’t serve both God and riches.__** Matthew 6:24.\\
Here riches is personified as a master whom people might serve.

===== Examples from English =====

**That delicious looking dessert is calling out to me, "Eat me. Eat me."**  This personification helps to show how tempted the speaker feels to eat the cake. It also implies that the responsibility for the speaker's choice to eat the cake belongs to the cake.

**The raging fire devoured everything in its way.**  \\ This description of the fire helps show how terrifying and destructive it was by comparing it to a wild animal that devours other animals.
