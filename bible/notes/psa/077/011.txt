===== translationNotes: =====

The writer begins to speak to Yahweh.

  * **I will call to mind...think about...ponder...reflect on** - These phrases all mean basically the same thing and emphasize how much he will think about what God has done. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **call to mind** - "remember" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
