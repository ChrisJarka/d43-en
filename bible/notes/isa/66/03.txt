<usfm>
\v 3 He that kills an ox is as he that kills a man; he that sacrifices a lamb, as he that breaks a dog’s neck; he that
offers an oblation, as he that offers swine’s blood; he that burns frankincense, as he that blesses an idol.
Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations:
</usfm>
