===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **What are the two of you** - "You" refers to the two men. Use //you// (dual) if your language has that form; otherwise, use //you// (plural). 
    * **Are you the only person** - "You" refers to Jesus, use //you// (singular). This is a rhetorical question (see [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]]) meaning "You must be the only person."
