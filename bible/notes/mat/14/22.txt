\v 22 Right after that happened, Jesus told the disciples to get in the boat and to go ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. In the meantime, he was going to send the crowd home.
\v 23 After he sent the crowd away, he went up into the hills to pray by himself. When it was evening, he was still there alone.
\v 24 By this time the disciples were a long distance from the shore. The wind was blowing very hard opposite to how the disciples were trying to sail; the wind made very large waves that were tossing the boat back and forth in the water.

\v 22 Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he himself would send the crowds away.
\v 23 After he had sent the crowds away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had fully come, he was there alone.
\v 24 But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, almost uncontrollable because of the waves, for the wind was contrary.
