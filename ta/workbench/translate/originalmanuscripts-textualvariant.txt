===== Description =====

See ([[:en/ta/workbench/translate/originalmanuscripts]]) for a description of how the Bible was written and copied, and how it come to today’s world.

Some people who were making copies of Bible books added words or even whole sentences into the text that they copied. Sometimes this was to explain what was in the text and sometimes it was to add to the ideas in the text, often using phrases from other places in the Bible. Sometimes this happened accidentally, as the person copied something twice or included in the text a comment that someone else had written beside the text. Sometimes words were left out by accident, as well. But over all, the Bible books have been copied with great accuracy and faithfulness over many, many years. By comparing many different copies with each other, Bible scholars can decide which copies contain the original wording and which ones have errors.

Sometimes the ULB will have a footnote that says something like, “some ancient authorities add a verse here.” We recommend that the translator include this footnote when translating the passages where it appears in the ULB. For example, there will be a note like this at Mark 16:9-20 and at verses such as Acts 8:37 and 1 John 5:7-8. This means that some copies of the Bible have these verses, but other copies that are older and considered to be accurate do not.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Matthew 18:10-11 has a footnote about verse 11. \\ 
  * **<sup>10</sup> See that you do not despise any of these little ones. For I say to you that in heaven their angels always look on the face of my Father who is in heaven. <sup>11</sup><sup>[1]</sup>** \\ 
    * <sup>[1]</sup> Many authorities, some ancient, insert v. 11. //For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.//\\ 

John 7:53-8:11 is not in the best earliest manuscripts. It has been included in the ULB, but it is marked off  with square brackets ([ ]) at the beginning and end, and there is a footnote after verse 11. \\
  * **<sup>53</sup>[Then every man went to his own house.…  <sup>11</sup>She said, "No one, Lord." Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way; from now on sin no more."]<sup>[2]</sup>**
    * <sup>[2]</sup>The best earliest manuscripts do not have John 7:35-8:11
===== Translation Strategies =====
When there is a textual variant, you may choose to follow the ULB or another version that you have access to.

  - Translate the verses that the ULB does and include the footnote that the ULB provides.
  - Translate the verses as another version does, and change the footnote so that it fits this situation.  



===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

The translation strategies are applied to Mark 7:15-16, which has a footnote about verse 16.
  * ** <sup>14</sup>He called the crowd again and said to them, "Listen to me, all of you, and understand. <sup>15</sup>There is nothing from outside of a person that can defile him when it enters into him. It is what comes out of the person that defiles him." <sup>16[1]</sup>** \\ 
    * **<sup>[1]</sup>Many ancient authorities insert v. 16. //If any man has ears to hear, let him hear//.**

1. Translate the verses that the ULB does and include the footnote that the ULB provides. \\ 
  * <sup>14</sup>He called the crowd again and said to them, "Listen to me, all of you, and understand. <sup>15</sup>There is nothing from outside of a person that can defile him when it enters into him. It is what comes out of the person that defiles him." <sup>16[1]</sup>\\ 
    * <sup>[1]</sup>Many ancient authorities insert v. 16. //If any man has ears to hear, let him hear//.

2. Translate the verses as another version does, and change the footnote so that it fits this situation.\\ 
  * <sup>14</sup>He called the crowd again and said to them, "Listen to me, all of you, and understand. <sup>15</sup>There is nothing from outside of a person that can defile him when it enters into him. It is what comes out of the person that defiles him. <sup>16</sup>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear." <sup>[1]</sup>\\ 
    * <sup>[1]</sup>Some ancient authorities do not have v. 16.
