<usfm>
\v 17 When Aaron goes into the Very Holy Place \add in the Sacred Tent\add* to purify it, no one else is permitted to enter \add the other part of\add* the Sacred Tent. Only after Aaron has performed rituals to enable me to forgive him and his family, and all the Israelite people, is any priest permitted to enter the Sacred Tent.
\p
\v 18 Then Aaron must go outside the tent to purify my altar. He must do this by smearing some of the blood from the bull and some of the blood from the goat on each of the projections at the corners of the altar.
\v 19 Then Aaron must dip his finger into the \add basin of\add* blood and sprinkle some of the blood over the altar seven times. By doing that, he will cleanse it from being unholy \add because of the sins\add* of the Israelite people, and it will become holy again.

\v 17 And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goes in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.
\v 18 And he shall go out to the altar that is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it, and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.
\v 19 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel.
