===== Description =====

In the Bible, events are not always told in the order in which they occurred. Sometimes the author wanted to discuss something that happened at an earlier time than the event that he just talked about. Many languages do this by using different tenses or time words such as ‘earlier,’ ‘last year,’ or ‘before that.’ Other languages prefer to state the events in the order that they occurred to avoid confusion. For events that are told in the order in which they occurred, it is also necessary in many languages to mark the order of events with connecting words such as "after these things," "having done this," or "then." It is important to help your readers understand the correct order of events in a natural way when translating into your language. 

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**He approached him and bound up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them.** (Luke 10;34) // 
This could sound like the Samaritan bound up the wounds and then poured oil and wine on the bandages. To make the order of what happened more clear, you might consider rearranging the phrases in this sentence to read, 
"The Samaritan went to him, poured oil and wine on his wounds, and put bandages on them."//

**But then Herod ... had John locked up in prison. Now it came about, while all the people were being baptized by John, that Jesus also was baptized.** (Luke 3:20-21) \\ 
It sounded like Jesus was baptized by John in prison.
Some languages will have to make the order of events clear by saying, "Now it came about, while all the people were being baptized by John, that Jesus also was baptized. But then Herod did another very evil thing. He had John locked up in prison."\\  


===== Translation Strategies =====

  - In languages that use time words such as already or yesterday to show events that happened before, be sure to put them in.
  - In languages who prefer to tell evens in the order they occur reorder the events. It may be necessary at times to put some verses or parts of verses in a different order. When you put verses in a different order, you may need to combine the verse numbers so that the numbers can stay in the right order, such as labeling a chunk of two reordered verses as 5-6. You should only put verses in a different order when necessary to avoid confusion or wrong meaning. The translation should always be clear, accurate, and natural. \\
