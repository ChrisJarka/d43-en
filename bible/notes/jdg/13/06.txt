\v 6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:
\v 7 but he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any
unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
