\v 38 For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
\v 39 And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise
it up at the last day.
\v 40 For this is the will of my Father, that every one that sees the Son, and believes on him, should have eternal life;
and I will raise him up at the last day.
