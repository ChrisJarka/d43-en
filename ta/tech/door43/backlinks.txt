==== Links ====
In Door43, links are green words. Click on any green word and the new page opens. Sometimes you might want to open the page in a new window. To do this on a PC, right click on the green words and choose 'Open in a New Window' from the pop-up menu. On a Macintosh, click-and-hold on the green words and choose 'Open in a New Window' from the pop-up menu.\\

Some links have a World Icon just before the blue words. These links will open a video or a website in a new window. [[http://unfoldingword.org|unfoldingWord]] \\
Some links have a document before the blue words. These links will open the document in a new window.{{en:bible:team-info:test.pdf|sample}}
