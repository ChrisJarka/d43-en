\v 15 \add One day\add* David very much wanted \add some water\add* to drink, and said "I wish that someone would bring me some water from the well near the gate at Bethlehem!"
\v 16 So his three greatest warriors forced through the camp of Philistia soldiers and drew some water from the well, and brought it to David. But he would not drink it. Instead, he poured it out \add on the ground\add* to be an offering to Yahweh.
\v 17 He said, "Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That would be like \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* drinking the blood of these men who were willing\f + \ft Or: ready \f* to die for me!" So he refused to drink it.
\p That was one of the things that those three great warriors did.

\v 15 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!
\v 16 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that
was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out to Jehovah.
\v 17 And he said, Be it far from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this:
shall I drink the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These
things did the three mighty men.
