How to translate units of volume in the Bible:

  - Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. [See Transliterate]
  - An important reason for keeping the Bible terms is to show that the Bible is true and that people actually used these units of measure during that time period.
  - If it doesn't work to use the Bible term, then instead, state the equivalent amount using a unit of measure that is known.
  - These methods could be combined, using the Bible term, but then also giving the equivalent amount in the text or a note.

**measure** \\ 
Sometimes Hebrew doesn't use a unit for measuring volume, so the ULB and UDB supply the word "measure" as in 
[[en:bible:notes:hag:02:15|Haggai 2:16-17]].

Translation suggestions. Any of these could work: \\ 
1. Simply use the number without a unit. \\
2. Use a generic word like "measure." \\ 
3. Use the name of an appropriate container, such as "basket" for grain and "jar" for wine. \\ 
4. Use an appropriate measure that you are already using in your translation.
