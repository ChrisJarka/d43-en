\v 4 The  serpent said to the woman, "You will surely not die.
\v 5 For God knows that the day you eat it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
\v 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate it. And she gave some also to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **your eyes will be opened**  - This metaphor means "you will understand new things." This meaning can be stated clearly as it is in the UDB, and it can be expressed as a simile: "It will be as though your eyes were opened." (UDB) (See [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor]])
  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **knowing good and evil** -  "being able to distinguish what is good from what is bad." This tells how they would be like God. It can translated as "because you will know good and evil" or "in that you will be able to distinguish what is good from what is bad."
  * **it was a delight to the eyes** - "the tree was delightful to look at" or "it was nice to look at" or "it was very beautiful" (UDB).
  * **and that the tree was desirable to make one wise**  - "and she wanted it because it could make a person wise"
