===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Birds settled\f + \ft Or: went to live \f* on the fallen tree, and wild animals lived among its branches.
\v 14 The result of what I have done is that no other trees, even if they have plenty of water, will ever grow very high and become proud, and lift their tops above the branches of other trees. I do not want any other tree to grow high like that cedar tree did; trees will all certainly die and decay in the ground, like people die and go down to their graves.

\q
\v 13 All the birds of the heavens dwelt upon its husk;
\q And All the living beasts of the field were in its branches.
\v 14 So that none of the watered trees would grow tall in height, and they would not set their tree tops within the foliage, for they would not stand before them in their heights. None who drank the waters! For they were all given to death upon the lowest part of the earth, in the midst of the children of men who went down to the pit.
