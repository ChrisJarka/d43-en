===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the king's word was enforced against Joab** - "the command of the king prevailed despite Joab's objections" 
  * **So Joab left and went throughout all Israel** - It may be helpful to add the words "to count the people" to make the meaning clear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **men who drew the sword** - The soldiers in Israel are described by the action of pulling out a sword to fight with it. AT: "men who were prepared to serve as soldiers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
