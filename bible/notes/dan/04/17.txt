\v 18 "Belteshazzar, that is what I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw in my dream. Now you tell me what the dream means. No one else can tell me.

<usfm>
\v 17 The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the decision is by the word of the holy ones so that those who are alive may know that the Most High rules over the kingdom of men and gives it to anyone he wishes and sets over it the lowliest of men.'
\v 18 This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now you, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation because all the men who have wisdom in my kingdom cannot interpret it for me. But you are able because the spirit of the holy gods is in you."
