===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Even today my complaint is bitter** - Here "Even today" emphasizes that his friends arguments have not changed Job's situation at all. AT: "In spite of what you have said, my complaint is still bitter"
  * **my complaint is bitter** - Job speaks of his unanswered complaint against God as if it was a bitter taste in his mouth. AT: "my unanswered complaint is as bad as bitter food in my mouth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my suffering is heavier than my groaning** - Some translations read, "my hand is heavy because of my groaning" or "his hand is heavy despite my groaning." The "heavy hand" is God's punishment that makes Job suffer.
