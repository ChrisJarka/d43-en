<usfm>
\v 5 They willfully forget that the heavens and the earth were established out of water and through water, long ago, by the word of God,
\v 6 and that through his word and the water the world at that time, being flooded, was destroyed.
\v 7 But now the heavens and the earth are reserved by that same word for fire, being reserved for the day of judgment and the destruction of the ungodly people.
