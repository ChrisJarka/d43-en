====== Jubilee ======

===== Definition: =====

The word "Jubilee" occurs 26 times in Leviticus and once in Numbers. Most English translations simply use the word "Jubilee," which comes from a transliteration of the Hebrew word //yobel// 'ram's horn.' It was blown on the Day of Atonement to announce the time for restoration. 

There is also an English definition for the word: celebration of a 25-year or 50-year anniversary. 

The historical Jewish definition is a year of freeing people and returning land, celebrated every 50 years.
