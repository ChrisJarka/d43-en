\v 4 In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought
them to him into the temple of Yahweh, and he made a covenant with them. He put them under an oath in the temple of Yahweh, and he showed them the king’s son.
\v 5 He commanded them, saying, "This is the thing that you must do. A third of you who come in on the sabbath will 
keep watch of the king’s house, 
\v 6 and a third will be at the gate Sur, and a third at the gate behind the guard. So shall you keep watch over the palace and form a barrier.
