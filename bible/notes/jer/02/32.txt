\v 32 Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
\v 33 How trimmest you your way to seek love! therefore even the wicked women have you taught your ways.
\v 34 Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: you did not find them breaking in; but it is
because of all these things.
