=== What is the Book of Revelation about? ===

Revelation talks about the end of time, however that should be understood. While some of the book gives specific words of [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophecy]] to churches, most of the events described in the book concern the wrath of God being poured out on creation. During this time, the ministry of the antichrist will unfold over a period of seven years. Ultimately, Jesus will be victorious, and all who put their trust in him will live forever with him. This book warns its readers and gives them assurance that God is in control. Eventually, [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] must come to an end.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Revelation,” "The Revelation of Jesus Christ," or "“The Apocalypse of John.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Things that Jesus Christ Showed to John." (See: [:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Revelation? ===

The book of Revelation was probably written by the apostle John. He wrote the book of Revelation while on the island of Patmos, where he was exiled for preaching the good news about Jesus Christ.

=== What type of writing is the Book of Revelation? ===

John uses many images throughout the book to describe the things he saw. The writing style of Revelation is unique, which may be because it is not meant to be quickly and universally understood.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Are the events of Revelation past or future? ===

Many scholars have very different theories about the Book of Revelation. The book can be difficult to interpret for many different reasons. Some treat the events of the book as symbols, while others treat them as being fulfilled (at least in part) by the destruction of the Jewish temple in AD 70. Others believe that the events of the book are entirely future. It is probable that at least many of the events are still for future fulfillment, and any fulfillment of these prophecies in the past was was either partial or a foreshadowing of what would eventually come. If possible, leave the prophecies in the tense they are found in the ULB (often future tense) and do not interpret them as already fulfilled. Some languages will prefer to use an "imperfect" form to identify that the events are not complete according to the speaker. This is acceptable. 

=== How does the Book of Revelation relate to the rest of Scripture? ===

While the Book of Revelation is very different than the rest of Scripture, it is rooted in the Old Testament understanding of the end times. Revelation, Daniel, Ezekiel, Zechariah and a number of other books are all thematically related to each other; they form one cohesive account of the end times. Because of their shared imagery and background, it may be beneficial to translate Revelation about the same time that one translates Daniel. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Do I need to understand the Book of Revelation in order to translate it? ===

The translator does not need to have a definite understanding of the theology of the Book of Revelation in order to properly translate it. Symbols should not be given any possible identification to their meaning. The same holds true for numbers, which have great significance the the Book of Revelation. Chronological sequences should be left vague.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Revelation? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of Revelation:\\

  * "'I am the Alpha and the Omega,' says the Lord God, 'the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.'" (1:8) The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. Some versions add the phrase "the Beginning and the End."
  * "the elders laid down on the ground and worshiped" (5:14). Some manuscripts read, "the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped Him who lives forever and ever."
  * "and a third of the earth was burned up" (8:7). Some manuscripts omit this phrase.
  * Some manuscripts add the phrase "and who is to come" (11:17)
  * Some manuscripts add the phrase "before the throne of God" (14:5)
  * "the one who is and who was, the Holy One" (ULB) (16:5). Some manuscripts read "O Lord, The One who is and who was and who is to be."
  * Some manuscripts add the phrase "of those who are saved" (21:24) 
  * "those who wash their robes" (22:14). Some manuscripts read "they who do his commandments"
  * "tree of life" (ULB) (22:19). Some manuscripts read "book of life."

Translators are advised not to translate this phrase. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region have it, it is not wrong to translate it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of Revelation.
