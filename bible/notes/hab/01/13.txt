\v 13 You that are of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that can not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest you upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest your peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he;
\v 14 and make men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
