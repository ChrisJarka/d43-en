===== Bible Examples =====

=== Luk:24:16 ===

"But their eyes were prevented from recognizing him."

  * **(1) Their eyes were prevented from recognizing him**  - **(2)** "Their eyes were kept from recognizing Jesus." **(3)** The men's ability to recognize Jesus is spoken of as their eyes' ability to recognize him. **(4)** It can also be translated as "They were kept from recognizing him" or "Something prevented them so they could not recognize him." **(5)** (See: [[:en:ta:translate:synecdoche]])

=== Luk:09:58 ===

"Jesus said to him, 'Foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.'"

  * **(1) nowhere to lay his head**  - **(2)** "nowhere to rest my head" or "nowhere to sleep."  **(3)** In this hyperbole Jesus is exaggerating in order to get across the point that he was not welcome anywhere to live. **(5)** (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hyperbole|Hyperbole]])

=== Act:07:43 ===

You accepted the tabernacle of Molech
And the star of the god Rephan,
And the images that you made to worship them:
And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.'

  * **(1) tabernacle of Molech**  - **(3)** The tabernacle or tent that housed the false god Molech.
