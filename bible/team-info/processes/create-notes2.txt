====== How to Create Translation Notes-2 ======

==== Formatting Notes ====

We have developed a general method for the format of the translation notes. We want the notes for all books to follow the same general pattern. See the link below for more information about formatting.

==== Reasons for translation notes: ====

There are many different situations where notes are necessary. These include:

  * Neither the UDB nor the KT's clarify the meaning
  * There is implicit information that is not stated
  * English does not convey important information from the original languages
  * Some languages may not have the same syntactic structures as English
  * Idioms or figures of speech may not be understood
  * Cultural concepts and customs may not be understood
  * etc.

Here are some reasons for different kinds of translation notes.

  * Neither the ULB nor the UDB gives certain information that translators might need in order to translate the text.
      * who or what a pronoun or demonstrative refers to
      * which meaning is intended for a word that has multiple meanings

  * Translators may need certain information because of the grammar of their language.
      * whether 'you' is singular, dual, or plural
      * whether 'we' includes the audience or not
      * who the actor is in a passive clause

  * Some languages don't have the same syntactic structures that English has or they may use them only for certain purposes. We may need to give suggestions for translating texts that have things like passive clauses, relative clauses, appositions, ellipses, or indirect quotes.

  * Translators may not understand a particular figure of speech and may need some suggestions for how to translate it â€“ particularly if they don't use that kind of figure or would not use it in certain situations.

  * The translators and their readers may not be familiar with the cultures of the Bible, and so may not understand the text because they lack information that the authors left implicit. We may need to explain the implicit information and give suggestions for how they might translate it. (We don't want to add information to the text that the author was not intending to communicate. But if the author must have assumed that the people would have something in mind in order to understand what he was saying, we may need to bring that out.)

  * If a page has a continuing quote, we'll need a note in parentheses like "John continues speaking to the crowd" or "Jesus continues speaking to his disciples" or "Jesus continues telling his parable."

==== List of Important Terms ====

The Important Terms section will have a list of the important terms in the ULB on that page. Each word will be linked to a Key Term page that explains it. Do not write anything in this section. If you think a word should be included, say so in the Discussion section. This page explains how we decide whether a term should have a page: [[:en:bible:team-info:training:topics:kt-yes-no|Is It a Key Term?]]
