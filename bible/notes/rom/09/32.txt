\v 32 The reason \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add that they did not succeed\add* is that they did not trust that \add God would provide a way to save them\add*. Instead, they were trying to do certain things \add in order that God would accept them. Because they did not expect the Messiah to die, the Israelites\add* felt disgusted concerning \add Jesus' death, which is like\add* the stone \f + \ft metaphor \f* on which people stumble.
\v 33 This is what \add a prophet\add* predicted when he wrote these words that\add God said about the Messiah\add*:
\q Listen! I am placing in Israel \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add one who is like\add* a stone \f + \ft metaphor \f* on which people will stumble. What he does will offend people \f + \ft doublet \f*. Nevertheless, those who believe in him will not be disappointed.
