===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues telling his story.)
    * **Leave it alone this year** - The servant (with definite length of time and course of action in mind) appealed to the master to extend his patience for one more year.
    * **while I dig around it** - The servant reveals or expresses his course or plan of action to his master
    * **If it bears fruit next year, good** - The servant (without being over optimistic) recognizes the new condition and preparation he gives to the tree, the fig tree may bear fruit which is the master's desire, then the tree will continue to live.
    * **but if it does not** - That is if the fig tree fails to bear fruit in spite of all the servant's effort, the master has gotten his support to take the fig tree down. Both the patience of the master and the grace of the servant will henceforth be justly terminated.
