\v 15 And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him
to the king.
\v 16 And he said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Forasmuch as you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of
Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore you shall not come down from the bed whither
you are gone up, but shall surely die.
