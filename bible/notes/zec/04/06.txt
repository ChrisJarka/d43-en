\v 6 Then the angel said to me, "This is the message from Yahweh to you, Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah: 'You will do what I want you to do, but it will not be by your own strength or power. It will be done by the power of my Spirit,' says Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies."
\v 7 The angel continued to speak to me: "Zerubbabel, you have many difficult matters to handle. They are like high mountains. But it will be as though they became flat land. And you will bring to the new temple the final stone, the highest stone, to complete it. When you set it in place, all the people will shout repeatedly, 'It is beautiful! May God bless it!'"

\v 6 So he said to me, "This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel: 
\q 'Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,' 
\q says Yahweh of hosts.
\v 7 'What are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain, 
\q and he will bring out the top stone to shouts of "Grace! Grace!"'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

**General Information:** - Zech. 4:6b-10a appears in the ULB and UDB in the same order as in the original text, but it is actually out of order in terms of the flow of information. See the chapter introduction for more details.

  * **seven lamps are the eyes of Yahweh** - The seven lamps are symbols for the eyes of Yahweh. 
  * **the eyes of Yahweh** - The word "eyes" refers to God seeing because eyes are used for seeing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
