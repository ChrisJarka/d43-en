\v 1 \add One day\add* David talked with all his army officers. Some of them were commanders of 100 soldiers and some were commanders of 1,000 soldiers.
\v 2 Then he summoned the other Israelite leaders and said to all of them, "If it seems to you to be a good thing for us to do, and if it is what Yahweh our God wants, let's send a message to our fellow Israelites in all the areas of our country, including the priests and descendants of Levi who are living among them in their towns and in the nearby pasturelands, to come and join us,
\v 3 because we want to bring the Sacred Chest of our God back to us. While Saul \add was the king\add*, we did not go to God's presence to ask him what we should do."
\v 4 All the people agreed with David, because they all thought that it was the right thing to do.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.
\v 2 And David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seem good to you, and if it be of Jehovah our God, let us send
abroad every where to our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their
cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us;
\v 3 and let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we sought not to it in the days of Saul.
\v 4 And all the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
