\v 8 Now we have listened to the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, for all that he commanded us, to never drink wine all of our days: we, our wives, our sons, 
and our daughters.
\v 9 And to never build houses to dwell in them; and there is no vineyard, field, or seed for us.
\v 10 So we have lived in tents and listened and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
\v 11 But it was when Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon rose up against the land that we said, ‘Let us go,’ and we came to Jerusalem from before the army of Nebuchadnezzar 
and Aram. Then we dwelt in Jerusalem.”
