\v 19 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* \add had them\add* take along the bones of Joseph with them\f + \ft Or: us \f*, because Joseph long ago had made the Israelite people promise solemnly that they would do that. He had said to them, "God will enable your descendants to leave Egypt. When that happens, you must carry my bones with you."
\p
\v 20 The Israelite people left Succoth and traveled to Etham, at the edge of the desert, and they set up their tents there.
\v 21 \add When they traveled\add* during the daytime, Yahweh went in front of them in a tall \add white\add* cloud to show them the way. During the night, he went in front of them in a tall cloud that looked like a fire. By doing that, he enabled them to travel in the daytime and also at nighttime.
\v 22 The tall cloud did not leave them. It was always in front of them, as a bright white cloud in the daytime and like a fire at night.

\v 20 The Israelite people left Succoth and walked to Etham at the edge of the wilderness, and they set up their tents there.

\v 22 The tall cloud did not leave them. It was always in front of them, as a bright white cloud in the daytime and like a tall column of fire in the night.
