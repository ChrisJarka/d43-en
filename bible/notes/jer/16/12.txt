====== Jeremiah 16:12-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 But you \add who are living now\add* have done more wicked things than your ancestors did! Each of you stubbornly does the evil things that he desires and refuses to pay attention to what I say.
\v 13 So, I will throw you out of this land, and I will send you to a land that you and your ancestors have never known about. There you will worship other gods day and night. And I will not act mercifully toward you.'

<usfm>
\v 12 But you yourselves have brought about more wickedness than your fathers, for behold! Each man is walking according to the stubbornness of his wicked heart; there is no one who listens to me.
\v 13 So I will hurl you from upon this land unto the land that you have not known, you nor your fathers, and you will serve other gods there by day and night, since I will not give favor to you.
