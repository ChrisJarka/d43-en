  * **I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and will give to your descendants all these lands. Through your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed.**  - Yahweh paraphrases to Isaac the promise he made to Abraham in Gen 17:9 and the implications of the promise in 18:19. Be sure, however, that your words, when you translate, show that this promise is directed to Isaac and made to him.
