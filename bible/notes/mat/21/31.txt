\v 31 So which of the man's two sons did what their father desired?" They answered, "The older son." Jesus \add explained to them what that parable meant\add* by saying, "Think about this: \add It is more likely that other people, including\add* tax collectors and prostitutes, \add whom you think are very sinful\add*, will enter where God rules, than it is that you \add Jewish leaders\add* will enter.
\v 32 I \add say this to you\add* because, even though John\add the Baptizer\add* explained to you how to live righteously, you did not believe his message. But tax collectors and prostitutes believed his \add message, and they turned away from their sinful behavior\add*. In contrast, you, even though you saw what they did, refused to turn away from your sinful behavior, and you did not believe \add John's message\add*."

\v 31 Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus says to them, Verily I say to you, that the
publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
\v 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed
him: and you, when you saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, that you might believe him.
