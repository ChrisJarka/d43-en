\v 1 God, having of old time spoken to the fathers in the prophets by various portions and in various manners,
\v 2 has at the end of these days spoken to us in his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also
he made the worlds;
\v 3 who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his
power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
\v 4 having become by so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they.
\v 5 For to which of the angels said he at any time,
\q You are my Son,
\q This day have I begotten thee?
\p and again,
\q I will be to him a Father,
\q And he shall be to me a Son?
\p
\v 6 And when he again brings in the firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.
\v 7 And of the angels he saith,
\q Who makes his angels winds,
\q And his ministers a flame of fire:
\p
\v 8 but of the Son he saith,
\q Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever;
\q And the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of your kingdom.
\q
\v 9 You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;
\q Therefore God, your God, has anointed you
\q With the oil of gladness above your fellows.
\p
\v 10 And,
\q Thou, Lord, in the beginning did lay the foundation of the earth,
\q And the heavens are the works of your hands:
\q
\v 11 They shall perish; but you continuest:
\q And they all shall wax old as does a garment;
\q
\v 12 And as a mantle shall you roll them up,
\q As a garment, and they shall be changed:
\q But you are the same,
\q And your years shall not fail.
\p
\v 13 But of which of the angels has he said at any time,
\q Sit you on my right hand,
\q Till I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?
\p
\v 14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation?
