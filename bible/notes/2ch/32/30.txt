<usfm>
\v 30 Hezekiah was the one who told his workers to block the place where the water flows out of the Gihon Spring, and to build a tunnel through which the water flowed to the west side of the area called 'the City of David.' He was able to do everything that he wanted to do.
\v 31 But when messengers who were sent by the rulers of Babylon came and asked about the miracle that God had performed for him, God allowed Hezekiah to say what he himself wanted to say, in order to test \add whether or not Hezekiah would admit that God had performed a miracle\add*.

\v 30 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side
of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
\v 31 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the
wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.
