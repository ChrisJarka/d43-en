\v 6 So those officials took me from my cell and lowered me by ropes into a well in the courtyard. The well belonged to Malkijah, who was a son of the king. There was no water in the well, but there was a lot of mud, so I sank down deep into the mud.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they ... threw him into the cistern** - They literally "lowered Jeremiah down on ropes," but they treated him roughly. Your language may have another way of saying this. AT: "they ... roughly pushed him into the cistern" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **cistern** - a deep hole in the ground where people collect and store rain water
  * **the courtyard of the guard** - This was an open area attached to the king's palace that was surrounded by buildings and in which they kept prisoners. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:32:01|32:2]].
  * **They lowered Jeremiah down on ropes** - This tells how "they threw him into the cistern."
