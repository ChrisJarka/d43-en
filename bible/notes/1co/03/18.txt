\p
\v 18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
\v 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He that takes the wise in their craftiness."
\v 20 And again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are useless.
