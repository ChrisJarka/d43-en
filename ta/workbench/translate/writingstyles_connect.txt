===== Description =====

Connecting words are words that show how thoughts are related to other thoughts. This page is about words that connect statements and groups of statements to others. Examples of connecting words include: and, but, for, so, therefore, now, if, if only, since, then, when, while, whenever, because, yet, unless, like, and many more.
  * It was raining, __so__ I opened my umbrella.
  * It was raining, __but__ I did not have an umbrella.

Sometimes people do not use a connecting word when they expect the readers to understand the relationship because of the content.
  * It was raining. I didn't have an umbrella.

**Reason this is a translation issue**
  * Translators need to understand the meaning of a connecting word in the Bible and the relationship between the thoughts it is connecting.
  * Each language has its own ways of showing how thoughts are related.
  * Translators need to know how to help their readers understand the relationship between the thoughts.
===== Translation Strategies =====

If your language has a word that clearly translates the meaning of a connecting word found in the ULB, then consider translating with that word. These strategies below may help when your language cannot translate a connecting word found in the ULB.\\

1. Translators may need to use a connecting word even if the ULB does not use a connecting word. Use connecting words in your language that are natural and clear to your readers, as needed, even if the ULB does not use a connecting word.\\ 
2. Translators do not need to use a connecting word just because the ULB does. Translators must be careful to use whatever words sound natural and communicates the intended meaning clearly and accurately in their language.\\
3. Translators must understand the meaning of the two thoughts that the writer is connecting with his use of a connecting word. The context created by the writer by the two thoughts he is connecting will be very important to the meaning of the connecting word that connects those thoughts.\\
4. Translators may seek to translate with the same connecting word in your language when the meaning is essentially the same, even if the ULB does not use a connecting word, or even if the ULB uses different connecting words for the same meaning.\\ 
5. Translators may use different connecting words in your language when what is being said can be said in two different ways, but those ways mean the same thing. 




===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Translators may need to use a connecting word even if the ULB does not use a connecting word. Use connecting words in your language that are natural and clear to your readers, as needed, even if the ULB does not use a connecting word.\\ 

Perhaps in your language the connecting word "because" may be more clear than “and” in the verses above:\\
  * **For “all flesh is like grass, __and__ all its glory is like the flower of grass.** (I Peter 1:24)\\
    * "For “all flesh is like grass, __because__ all its glory is like the flower of grass."


In these verses, the connecting word “__because__” could be used instead of “and.” “__Because__” indicates that the words that follow will show the reason that “flesh is like grass,” not just “and” flesh is like a flower.\\

“__Because__” means that “all flesh is like grass” __because__ people’s bodies (their “flesh”) die, and then the “glory” of their bodies goes back into the ground, like a “flower” does when it dies.\\

So, if in your language the connecting word “and” here needs to show that the text is giving the reason that “flesh is like grass,” then you may use a word in your language that can mean that a reason is about to be given (like “__because__” does in English).\\
\\
**2.**  Translators do not need to use a connecting word just because the ULB does. Translators must be careful to use whatever words sound natural and communicates the intended meaning clearly and accurately in their language.

  * **For “all flesh is like grass, __and__ all its glory is like the flower of grass.** (I Peter 1:24)\\
    * For “all flesh is like grass; all its glory is like the flower of the grass.”

//__**For**__\\
“all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of grass.\\
The grass withers, and the flower falls off,\\
but the word of the Lord remains forever.”\\
This is the message that was proclaimed as the gospel to you.\\
(I Peter 2:24-25 ULB)//\\

In the verses above, the connecting word “__For__” connects these verses to what has been said previously in this chapter, which is describing the eternal word of God. So, these  verses continue describing how God’s word is eternal, “remaining forever.”\\

However, the connecting word “__For__” may not need to be present in your language. It might be more clear in your language just to leave the word “__For__” out of the translation, especially if that word is likely to cause confusion in your readers.\\ 
\\
**3.**  Translators must understand the meaning of the two thoughts that the writer is connecting with his use of a connecting word. The context created by the writer by the two thoughts he is connecting will be very important to the meaning of the connecting word that connects those thoughts.\\
//For\\
“all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of grass.\\
The grass withers, and the flower falls off,\\
**__but__** the word of the Lord remains forever.”\\
This is the message that was proclaimed as the gospel to you.\\
(I Peter 2:24-25 ULB)//\\

The connecting word “__but__” in these verses is connecting Peter’s description of the human body and flowers, which all die, with God’s word, which will never die. So, “__but__” is showing that there is a very strong difference between human bodies and flowers, and God’s word. “But” is strongly contrasting God’s word that lives forever with the lives of people and plants, which die.\\ 

So a connecting word in your language that indicates a strong contrast needs to be used here to show that the two thoughts connected by this connecting word are very different from one another—opposites from each other.\\
\\
**4.**  Translators may seek to translate with the same connecting word in your language when the meaning is essentially the same, even if the ULB does not use a connecting word, or even if the ULB uses different connecting words for the same meaning.\\

Readers of your translation may be helped if you choose connecting words in your language for meanings that the translation will keep standard. For example, if your language has words like the words below that you define and use with standard meanings, meanings that these words will usually have, then I Peter 2:24-25 might be translated as described below.\\
\\
**Therefore**: This connecting word means that because of what has just been 
described, a result of that will now be described.\\
**Because**:   This connecting word means that the cause or reason for something is about to be described.\\
**Then**:      This connecting word means that the event which follows comes after the event previously mentioned or described.\\
**But**:       This connecting word shows a contrast between what has been previously described and what follows.\\
If these connecting words are used according to the meanings above, then the verses from 1 Peter might translated as follows:\\
\\
//**__Therefore__**,\\
“all flesh is like grass, **__because__** all its glory is like the flower of grass.\\
The grass withers, **__then__** the flower falls off,\\
**__but__** the word of the Lord remains forever.”\\
This is the message that was proclaimed as the gospel to you.//\\
(I Peter 2:24-25 ULB edited for this page)\\
\\
If connecting words can be defined and used by translators to have the same meaning each time they are used, or at least most of the time they are used, with only a small range of variation of meaning, then that should help readers understand the connecting words of your language in regard to how they are used and what they mean in your translation of the Bible.\\
\\
**5.**  Translators may use different connecting words in your language when what is being said can be said in two different ways, but those ways mean the same thing.\\
\\ 
Compare the different connecting words used by the ULB and an alternate translation below. Use whatever connecting words in your language communicate clearly and accurately the meaning of the Biblical text.\\
//For\\
“all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of grass.\\
The grass withers, and the flower falls off,\\
but the word of the Lord remains forever.”\\
This is the message that was proclaimed as the gospel to you.//\\
(I Peter 2:24-25 ULB)\\

//**__Therefore__,** “all people will die **__like__** grass dies,\\ 
**__because__** the life of each person dies **__like__** flowers fall to the ground.\\ 
**__Yet__**, the Lord’s words live forever!”\\ 
This is the message of good news that we proclaimed to you.//\\
(I Peter 2:24-25)\\

=== Now and Therefore ===

Two connecting words that appear often and can be misunderstood are the following.\\
\\
**Now**\\
\\
“Now” does not always mean only, “at this time,” but the word can also be a connecting word used with the meanings noted below. The word “now” can be used to mark a break in a storyline or teaching. In many languages the word “now” is used to:\\
1. Tell background information about someone or something in the story or teaching.\\
2. Start to tell a new part of the story or teaching.\\
3. Tell about a new person in the story or teaching.\\
4. Explain about what is happening in the story or teaching.\\
\\
Here are some examples:\\
“Now the ark of Yahweh was in the country of the Philistines for seven months.” (I Samuel 6:1 ULB)\\ 
“Now I remind you, brothers and sisters, of the gospel I proclaimed to you, which you received and on which you stand…” (I Corinthians 15:1 ULB)\\
\\
**Therefore**\\
\\
The word “therefore” indicates that because of what has just been said, there is now something that is true or should be done or might happen that is based on the previous information. When what has just been said or described or explained has a result that might follow or will follow, the word “therefore” is used to alert the reader or hearer that the following information is a result of what they just read or heard. So, a word in target language that will alert the reader that the following information is a result of what they just read or heard needs to be used in the translation of the word “therefore.”\\
\\
“Therefore” can mean “for that reason” or “so.” The reason may not be in the immediately preceding sentence, but the reason might be further back in the text.
