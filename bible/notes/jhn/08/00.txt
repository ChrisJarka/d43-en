====== John 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Translators may wish to include a note at verse 1 to explain to the reader why they have chose to (or not to) translate verses 8:1-11. Because this is a controversial passage, it is best not to build theological conclusions from this passage.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Light ==
Light is a common image in Scripture used to represent [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]]. Light is also used to show the path of righteousness and to show righteous living. Darkness is often used as images representing [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] or [[:en:obe:kt:unrighteous|unrighteousness]].

== "I am..." ==

John uses this phrase seven times in his gospel. It is the same words used by God, when he revealed himself and his name at the burning bush. The name “Yahweh” can be translated as “I am.”

== "A woman caught in the act of adultery" ==
If the woman was caught in the act of adultery, there was a man who was also caught in the act of adultery. The man is noticeably absent from this account. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Son of Man" ==

Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this passage. It may not be possible in every language to have someone speaking in the first person, also speak in the third person.
