\v 2 And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses.
\v 3 So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.
\v 4 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to
the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
\v 5 Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah: and Solomon and the assembly sought to it.
