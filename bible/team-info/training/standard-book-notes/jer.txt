====== Standard Notes for Psalms ======

This is a growing list of 'standard notes' that occur frequently in Jeremiah. Please use these so that there are consistent notes about the same topic throughout the book.

When a standard note includes brackets (see examples below), replace the brackets with the detail that is appropriate for the text you are working on.

**Put this note on the first chunk of each chapter.** \\
See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] \\ 
(Please add a talink tag on the chunk. The tA team will put in the link to "Translating Poetry" once that page is completed.) \\
