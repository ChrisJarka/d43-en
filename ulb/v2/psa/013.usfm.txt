\c 13
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 How long, O Jehovah? will you forget me for ever?
\q How long will you hide your face from me?
\q
\v 2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul,
\q Having sorrow in my heart all the day?
\q How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
\q
\v 3 Consider and answer me, O Jehovah my God:
\q Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
\q
\v 4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him;
\q Lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved.
\q
\v 5 But I have trusted in your lovingkindness;
\q My heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
\q
\v 6 I will sing to Jehovah,
\q Because he has dealt bountifully with me.
