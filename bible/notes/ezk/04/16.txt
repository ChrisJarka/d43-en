===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Son of man**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:03|2:03]].
  * **behold**  - This can be translated as “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”
  * **I am breaking the staff of bread**  - The word "I" refers to God. The phrase "staff of bread" refers to Jerusalem's supply of bread. A staff is something used to support someone who is walking, bread is used to support life. By breaking the staff of bread, God is stopping the way the people of Israel get food. It is called a staff because they rely on it to get bread. (See: [[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **while rationing it in anxiety**  - The word "rationing" means to plan out how much of something is needed for each use so that it can last as long as possible. They were worried about their rations because eventually they would run out and have no food.
  * **rationing it in trembling**  - The word "trembling" refers to someone shaking because they are very scared. Alternate translation: "rationing it in fear" (See: [[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **every man will be dismayed at his brother**  - The reason people are looking at their brothers in dismay is because they know every person needs food and more people means they will run out of food sooner. Alternate translation: "every man will look at his brother and be sad" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **melt away because of their iniquity**  - The words "melt away" mean that something is getting smaller.  Like butter or ice will melt away when heated, a person will melt away when they don't eat. "become thin because of their iniquity." (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metaphor]])
