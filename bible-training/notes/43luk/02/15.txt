===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **from them**  - That is, "from the shepherds."
    * **to each other**  - That is, "to one another." There may have been more than two shepherds.
    * **Let usâ€¦ to us**  - Since the shepherds were speaking to one another, languages that have inclusive forms for "we" and "us" should use the inclusive form here. (See [[:en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive|Inclusive]].)
