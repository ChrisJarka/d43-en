<usfm>
\v 12 Let the nations rouse themselves
And come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat.
For there will I sit to judge
All the nearby nations.
\v 13 Put you in the sickle
For the harvest is ripe.
Come, crush you the grapes
For the winepress is full
The vats overflow
For their wickedness is enormous.
