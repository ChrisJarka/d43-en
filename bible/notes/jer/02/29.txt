<usfm>
\p
\v 29 Wherefore will you contend with me? you all have transgressed against me, says Jehovah.
\v 30 In vain have I struck your children; they received no correction: your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a
destroying lion.
\v 31 O generation, see you the word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? or a land of thick darkness? wherefore
say my people, We are broken loose; we will come no more to thee?
