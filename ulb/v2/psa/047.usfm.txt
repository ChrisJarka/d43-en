\c 47
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
\q
\v 1 Oh clap your hands, all you peoples;
\q Shout to God with the voice of triumph.
\q
\v 2 For Jehovah Most High is terrible;
\q He is a great King over all the earth.
\q
\v 3 He subdueth peoples under us,
\q And nations under our feet.
\q
\v 4 He chooses our inheritance for us,
\q The glory of Jacob whom he loved. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 God is gone up with a shout,
\q Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.
\q
\v 6 Sing praises to God, sing praises:
\q Sing praises to our King, sing praises.
\q
\v 7 For God is the King of all the earth:
\q Sing you praises with understanding.
\q
\v 8 God reigneth over the nations:
\q God sits upon his holy throne.
\q
\v 9 The princes of the peoples are gathered together
\q To be the people of the God of Abraham;
\q For the shields of the earth belong to God:
\q He is greatly exalted.
