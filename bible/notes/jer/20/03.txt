\v 3 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah to him,
Jehovah has not called your name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.
\v 4 For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends; and they shall fall by the
sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he
shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill them with the sword.
