  * **Kenaanah** - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **horns of iron** - This is a reference to the horns of a bull but they made of metal.
  * **you will push the Arameans until they are consumed** - The prophet's actions are a symbolic metaphor that illustrates the way that Ahab would defeat the Arameans. Ahab's army will win with great strength, as a bull attacks another animal. AT: "With horns like these, your army will keep attacking the army of Aram like a bull attacks another animal, until you completely destroy them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **until they are consumed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "until you consume them" (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **has given it into the hand of the king** - Here the king's "hand" refers to his control. This means that God will enable them to defeat the people at Ramoth Gilead. AT: "has allowed the king to capture it" or "will allow your armies to capture it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
