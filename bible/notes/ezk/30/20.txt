\v 20 Almost eleven years after the Babylonians took us Israelites to their country, Yahweh gave me another message on the seventh day of the first month of that year. He said,
\v 21 "Son of man, I have enabled the army of Nebuchadnezzar to defeat the army of the king of Egypt. It is as though I have broken one of the arms of the king of Egypt, and it has not been bandaged in order that it could be healed, and it has not been put in splints in order that after it heals the arm will be strong enough to hold a sword.

\v 20 Then it came about in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 21 “Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Behold! It is not bound up and able to receive medicine or able for anyone to place a bandage on it, so it will not be strong enough to grasp a sword."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then it came to pass**  - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **in the eleventh year** - It is implied that this is the eleventh year after the Babylonians took king Jehoiachin to Babylon. Alternate translation: "in the eleventh year after the Babylonians took king Jehoiachin to Babylon." The people of Judah started counting their time in Babylon from the time the Babylonians took Jehoiachin to Babylon. (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **in the first month** - It was understood that this was the first month of the eleventh year. Alternate translation: "in the first month of that year."
  * **The Word of Yahweh came to me and said** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]].
  * **broken the arm of Pharaoh**  - The "arm of Pharaoh" refers to the "power of Pharaoh. "broken the power of Pharaoh" or "broken the control of Pharaoh". Alternate translation: "I have taken away some of Pharaoh's power." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **Behold**  - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **It is not bound up to receive medicine** - "The arm Pharaoh is not wrapped up so it can heal." This phrase compares the way an arm heals to the way a person regains power. Alternate translation: "Pharaoh will not receive help that will let him regain power."
  * **set a bandage to bind it** - "there is no bandage to wrap the arm of Pharaoh." There is nothing to help the arm heal and there is nothing to help Pharaoh regain power. Alternate translation: "nothing can help Pharaoh regain power."
  * **so it will be not be strong enough to grasp a sword** - The "it" here is the broken arm. Just like a broken arm that cannot carry a sword, Pharaoh will not regain the power that he had in war. Alternate translation: "Pharaoh will not regain his power in war."
