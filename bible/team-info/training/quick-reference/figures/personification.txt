====== Personification ======


===== Description =====

Personification is giving human attributes to a non-human object (i.e. thing, idea or animal). Personification helps a writer to make something more vivid or life-like. It adds depth to writing and helps the reader 'feel' the subject matter more fully.

=== Genesis 1:18 ===

"God set them (lights) in the sky to give light upon the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness."

  * **(1) to rule over the day**  -  **(3)** This phrase describes the lights as having the same authority over the day as a ruler who directs a group of people. **(4)** This can be translated as "to direct the daytime" or "to mark the times of the day." **(5)** (See: Personification)

=== Galatians 3:7 ===

"The scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith. "

  * **(1) scripture foresaw**  -  **(3)**  Because God made the promise to Abraham and they wrote it down before the promise came through Christ, the scripture is like someone who knows the future before it happens.  **(4)** This can be translated as "predicted" or "saw before it happened."  **(5)** (See: Personification)

=== Titus 2:12 ===

"You see, the grace of God that is able to bring salvation to everyone has appeared and trains us to deny ungodliness and worldly passions and to live sensibly, righteously, and in a godly way in this age"

  * **(1) the grace of God...trains us**  -  **(3)** This presents the grace of God as a person who trains and disciplines people to live holy lives.  **(5)** (See: Personification)
