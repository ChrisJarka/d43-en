Different languages have different rules about when to use pronouns. When you follow your language's rules for using pronouns, people will easily understand who and what your translation is about.\\  

==== Description ====

When we talk or write, we use pronouns to refer to people or things without always having to repeat the noun or name. Usually the first time we refer to someone in a story, we use a descriptive phrase or a name. The next time we might refer to that person with a simple noun or by name. After that we might refer to him simply with a pronoun, as long as we think that our listeners will be able to figure out easily who the pronoun refers to.

> Now there was __a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish Council__. __This man__ came to Jesus … Jesus replied to __him__ (John 3:1-3 ULB)

In John 3, Nicodemus is first referred to with noun phrases and his name. Then he is referred to with the noun phrase "this man." Then he is referred to with the pronoun "him."

Each language has its rules and exceptions to this usual way of referring to people and things. 
  * In some languages the first time something is referred to in a paragraph or chapter, it is referred to with a noun rather than a pronoun.
  * The **main character** is who a story is about. In some languages, after a main character is introduced in a story, he is usually referred to with a pronoun. Some languages have special pronouns that refer only to the main character.
  * In some languages, a change on the verb helps people know who the subject is. (For example in English, //-s// is put on the end of the verb only when the subject is third person singular: "He come__s__." See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]].) In some of these languages, speakers do not use pronouns much, and listeners rely on the additions to the verb to help them figure out who the subject is. Speakers use a pronoun only when they want to emphasize or clarify who the subject is. 

==== Reason this is a translation issue ==== 
  * If translators use a pronoun at the wrong time, readers might not know who the pronoun refers to. 
  * If translators frequently refer to a main character by  name, listeners might not realize that the person is a main character.
  * If translators use pronouns, names or nouns at the wrong time, people might think that there is some special emphasis on it in the sentence.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

1. The two examples below occur at the beginning of a chapter. It some languages it might not be clear who the pronouns refer to.
> Again Jesus walked into the synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there. __They__ watched __him__ to see if __he__ would heal __him__ on the Sabbath. (Mark 3:1-2 ULB)

> The Pharisees and Sadducees came and tested __him__ by asking him to show them a sign from heaven. (Matthew 16:1 ULB)

In the example below, two men are named in the first sentence. It might not be clear who "he" refers to.
> Now after some days, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay an official visit to Festus. After __he__ had been there for many days, Festus presented Paul’s case to the king;  (Acts 25:13-14 ULB)

The first two sentences below refer to two Jesus and John. In some languages it might not be clear who "he" refers to. \\
> Jesus responded and said to him, "Permit it now, for it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John permitted him. After __he__ was baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him. (Matthew 3:15-16 ULB)

2.  The **main character** is who a story is about. In some languages, after a main character is introduced in a story, he is usually referred to with a pronoun. Some languages have special pronouns that refer only to the main character.

    * "Now after some days, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay an official visit to Festus. After __King Agrippa__ had been there for many days, Festus presented Paul’s case to him."

2. If repeating a name or noun more too much would lead people to think that  an important person in the story is not very important in the story, than use a pronoun instead.

  * __Jesus__ entered a boat, crossed over, and came into his own city. Behold, they brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a mat. Seeing their faith, __Jesus__ said to the paralyzed man, "Son, be of good cheer. Your sins have been forgiven."  (Matthew 9:1-2)
