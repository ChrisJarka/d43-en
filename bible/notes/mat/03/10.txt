\v 10 \add God is\add* ready \add to punish you if you do not turn away from your sinful behavior, just like\add* a man who lays his axe at the roots of a \add fruit\add* tree \add in order to\add* chop it down and throw it into the fire if it does not produce good fruit \f + \ft metaphor \f*."


\p
\v 11 "As for me, I \add am not very important, because\add* I baptize you \add only\add* with water. I \add baptize you\add* because of your feeling sorry that you have sinned. But someone else will come soon who is very great; \add he will do powerful deeds\add* (OR\add , act powerfully\add*)\add . Because he is\add* superior to me, I am not worthy \add even to do a menial task for him, such as\add* to carry his sandals.
\p He will put \add his\add* Holy Spirit \add within\add* you \add to truly change\add* the way you live \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and \add he will judge others of you and punish you in\add* the fire \add in hell\add*.
\v 12 \add He is like a farmer who wants to clear away the grain that is on the ground where it has been threshed\add* \f + \ft Or:\add they have threshed it\add* \f*\add . That farmer uses a\add* huge fork to throw the grain into the air \add to separate the wheat from the chaff\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and then he cleans up the threshing area. \add Similarly\add*, God will \add separate righteous people from the evil people like a farmer who\add* gathers the wheat into his storage area, and then \add God\add* will burn the\add people who are like\add* chaff with a fire that will never be put out \f + \ft metaphor \f*."

\v 10 God is ready right now to punish you, just like a man who starts to chop away the roots of a fruit tree that does not give good fruit. He will chop down every tree like that and throw it into the fire."



\p
\v 11 "As for me, I am not very important, because I baptize you only with water. I do it when people are sorry for having sinned. But someone else will come soon who will do very powerful things. He is so much greater than I, that I do not even deserve to carry his sandals. 
\p He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.
\v 12 He is holding his winnowing fork, ready to separate the good grain from the bad chaff. He is ready to clear out all the bad chaff from where he has threshed the grain. He will take the righteous people home, as a farmer puts his wheat into his storehouse; but he will burn the wicked people, like one burns the chaff, in a fire that never goes out."

\v 10 Already the ax has been placed against the root of the trees. So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.
\v 11 I baptize you with water for repentance. But he who comes after me is mightier than I, and I am not worthy even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
\v 12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire."
