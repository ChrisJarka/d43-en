\v 3 I will reject [IDI] such people and cause that they are no longer to be considered to belong to my people.
\v 4 If the people of that man's town ignore it when he kills one of his children to offer him as a sacrifice to Molech, and if they do not execute that person,
\v 5 I myself will punish that person and his family, and I will command that he no longer be able to associate with my people. And I will do the same thing to any others who do the same thing that he did to worship Molech.

\v 3 I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
\v 4 And if the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he gives of his seed to Molech, and put him not to death;
\v 5 then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that play the harlot after him, to play the harlot with Molech, from among their people.
