===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **All things...the Father has are mine...the Spirit will take things of mine** - God the Father, Son, and Spirit all own the universe together. Together they are the one and only God. All three persons work together to save believers from sin and explain it in the Bible. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **In a little while** - "Soon" or "Before long"
