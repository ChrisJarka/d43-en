\v 17 For someone like that to become acceptable to me again, some of the ashes from \add the cow\add* that was burned must be taken and put in a jar. Then some fresh water must be poured over the ashes.
\v 18 Then someone who has not become unacceptable to God must take a stalk of \add a plant named\add* hyssop and dip it into the water. Then that person must sprinkle some of the water on the tent where that person died, on the things that are in the tent, and on the people who were in the tent. He must also sprinkle some of that water on any person who touched a human bone or who touched a person who died, or who touched a grave.
\v 19 On the third day and on the seventh day after that, the person who is acceptable to me must sprinkle some of that water on those who have become unacceptable to God. On the seventh day, the people who are performing that ritual to become acceptable to me again must wash their clothes and bathe. If they do that, on that evening they will become acceptable to me again.
