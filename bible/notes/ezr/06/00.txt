====== Ezra 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The completion of the story of the building of the temple and re-establishment of the temple worship occurs in this chapter. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:temple]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Temple taxes ==
The king said the Jews were right and ordered money from his taxes to be used to help them with their sacrifices. 


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===
== Darius ==
In this chapter, Darius is called the king of Assyria. This was not a title, but a description. He was the ruler of the former Assyrian Empire. King Darius was king of Persia. Persia conquered Babylon, which had conquered Assyria. This made the king of Persia, the king of Assyria as well. It was unusual to refer to Darius as the king or ruler of Assyria. Ezra may have done this to contrast the actions of the current ruler of Assyria with the former rulers of Assyria. These former rulers were cruel to the Jews. They also conquered the northern tribes of Israel. After they did this, they lost their distinct identity and were no longer a people group.
