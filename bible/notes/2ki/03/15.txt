\v 15 But now bring me a musician." And it came to pass, when the harpist played, the hand of Yahweh came upon Elisha.
\v 16 And he said, "Thus says Yahweh, 'Make this wadi full of trenches.'
\v 17 For Yahweh says this, 'You will not see wind, neither will you see rain, but this wadi will be filled with water, and you will drink, you and your livestock and all your animals.'
