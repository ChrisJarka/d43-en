\v 7 Similarly, the people who lived in Sodom and Gomorrah cities and the nearby cities committed sexual immorality. They sought all kinds of sexual relations that differ from what God permits. So God destroyed their cities. What happened to those people and those angels in heaven shows that God will punish people, such as the ones who teach false doctrine, in the eternal fire of hell.
\v 8 Similarly, these ungodly people in your midst also defile their own bodies by living immorally. They say that God has sent them visions that tell them to live like this. But they do not obey God's commands, and they insult his wonderful angels.

\v 7 It is just like Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, which in a similar way gave themselves over to sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desires. They were given as examples of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.
\v 8 Yet in the same way these also pollute their bodies in their dreams, and they reject authority, and they say evil things about the glorious ones.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **in a similar way gave themselves over** - Sodom and Gomorrah lived in sexual sins the same way as the angels followed evil ways.
  * **as examples of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire** - The destruction of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah became an example for the fate of all who reject God.
  * **these also pollute** - "These" refers to the people who reject God ([[:en:bible:notes:jud:01:03|1:4]]) who pollute their bodies with sexual immorality the same way throwing garbage into a stream can cause the water to be bad to drink.
  * **about the glorious ones** - "about God's wonderful angels"
