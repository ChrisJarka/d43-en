\v 23 So now \add I will tell you why I changed my mind and did not visit you as I intended to do\add*: God himself knows \add that what I am telling you is true\add*. The reason that I did not return to Corinth was so that I might not have to \add speak to you severely about the wrong that you had done\add*.
\v 24 It is not that Silas, Timothy and I want to boss you \add and tell you that you must\add* believe only what we say. \add Not at all!\add* On the contrary, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are working as partners \add with you\add* in order to make you happy. \add We do not try to force you to believe everything that we believe, because we are sure that you are continuing to\add* trust \add the Lord Jesus Christ\add* and that you are remaining firmly committed to him.

\v 23 God will confirm that my purpose for you, Corinthians, was not to e overlook the problems you have, but to deal with them all harshly and honestly.
\v 24 We do not want to be masters who tell you how you must serve God, but we are working with you so you will know the joy that God gives his children, and so you can stand firm in your faith.

\v 23 But I call God to bear witness against me--that I did not come to Corinth to spare you.
\v 24 Not because we are commanding what your faith should be, but we are working with you for your joy, as you stand in your faith.
