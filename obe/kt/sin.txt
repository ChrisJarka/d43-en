====== sin, sinful, sinner ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "sin" refers to actions, thoughts, and words that are against God's will and laws. Sin can also refer to not doing something that God wants us to do.

Sin includes anything we do that does not obey or please God, even things that other people don't know about.

Thoughts and actions that disobey God's will are called "sinful."

Because Adam sinned, all human beings are born with a sinful nature.</font>

A "sinner" is someone who sins, so this applies to every human being.

Sometimes the word "sinner" was used by religious people like the Pharisees to refer to people they considered to be worse sinners than others. For example, this label was given to tax collectors and prostitutes.
