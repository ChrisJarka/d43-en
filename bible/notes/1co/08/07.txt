\v 7 Nevertheless, some people do not understand \add that idols are not really alive\add*. In the past, some among you who are believers now were accustomed to believing that idols \add were really alive\add*. As a result, when they eat such meat \add now\add*, they still think that it was sacrificed to an idol \add that is alive\add*. They are not sure \add that God allows believers to eat meat that has been offered to idols\add*. So, \add when they eat such meat\add*, they think that they have sinned.
\v 8 But God will not think more highly about us \add if we eat certain\add* foods, or if we do not eat \add certain foods\add*. That is, we are not more acceptable to God if we do not eat certain foods, nor are we more acceptable to him if we eat those foods.
\v 9 However, be sure that you do not do anything that God allows you to do, if by doing that you would encourage any of \add your fellow believers to do something that\add* they are not sure \add God allows them to do\add*. As a result, you would be causing them to sin.
\v 10 For example, you know \add that idols are not really alive\add*. Suppose that in a temple \add where they worship\add* idols you eat \add food that has been sacrificed to idols\add*. Suppose that someone who is not sure whether God allows us to eat that food sees you eating it. \add You\add* would be encouraging him to eat it, too.\f + \ft Or: Wouldn't \add you\add* be encouraging him to eat it, too? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 7 Not everyone has this knowledge and understanding there there being only one God and, they do not all know the lies about idolatry. Some worshiped an idol in earlier times, and they ate the food offered in sacrifice to the idol, as an act of worship. But now as Christians, they are concerned about hurting their faith by eating this kind of food. They are weak in faith, and they may think that eating this food is always connected with idolatry. Because their faith is weak, they believe it is a sin to eat it. They do not worship the idol any more, but their consciences accuse them that they are doing something wrong, or that you are, if you are eating that food.
\v 8 We know that the food we eat doesn't make us better or worse before God. The food we eat is not a matter that God commends or condemns.
\v 9 But what matters is your brother and sister in Christ. Your freedom should not crush the faith of the weak, or cause them to lose hope.
\v 10 You know that idols are not alive, nor are they gods at all. But if a weak brother sees you eating in an idol's temple (which is normal fare in our town), will that not endorse idolatry for the one who used to be an idolator? They used to eat meat sacrificed to idols, as an act of worship. You are just having a meal, but they may not know that and it hurts their weak faith.

\v 7 However, everyone does not have this knowledge. But some, being associated with idol worship in earlier times, ate this food as if it was a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
\v 8 But food will not commend us to God. We are not worse off if we do not eat, nor better off if we do eat it. 
\v 9 But take care that your freedom does not become a cause of stumbling to the weak.
\v 10 For if someone see you, you who has knowledge, eating in an idol's temple, will that person's conscience not be emboldened to eat food that has been sacrificed to idols?
