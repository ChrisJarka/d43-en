\v 13 The Lord said, "This people draw near to
me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. Their worship of me
is a commandment taught by men;
\v 14 Therefore, see, I will proceed to do a marvelous thing among this people, wonder after wonder. The
wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will disappear.
