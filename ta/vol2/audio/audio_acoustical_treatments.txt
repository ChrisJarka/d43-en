===== Simple Acoustical Treatments =====

This module answers the question: What are some simple acoustical treatments?\\
===  ===

Fortunately, with a little ingenuity, easy acoustic treatment solutions can be possible using locally available materials. This is good news, since professionally manufactured acoustic foam is quite expensive and not easy to obtain in many parts of the world.

One of the first steps toward acoustic treatment is to utilize existing furnishings such as chairs, beds, rugs, curtains, tapestries, shelves of books and many other common items that may already be in the room or in the house or facility. In fact, you will have probably identified in your assessment that the rooms that sound the best are often the ones with furniture absorbing and deflecting sound waves. It is our recommendation to use these furnishings to your advantage.

What kinds of things can be done to improve a decent room even further? Hanging blankets on the walls, placing a linen on the table or desk that the narrator is using can significantly reduce echo reflections. Other ideas include positioning pillows near the microphone or a suitcase with towels or linens inside just beyond the microphone in order to immediately absorb sound.

A caution needs to be mentioned, however, against taking acoustical treatment to the extreme. If too much treatment is used, such as covering all surfaces with carpet or foam, the room will have an unnatural lack of vibrance that a voice should have. The result is that the sound of the voice seems unnaturally dull and flat. So use good judgment when approaching acoustical treatment. Be sure to address the problems before you record, but do not go so extreme that you create an opposite acoustical problem.
