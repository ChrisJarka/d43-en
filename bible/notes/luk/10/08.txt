===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to give directions to the 70 people he was sending out.)
    * **and they receive you** - "if they welcome you"
    * **eat what is set before you**  - "eat whatever food they give you"
    * **The kingdom of God has come near to you**  - "The time for God's kingdom has come near to you." Possible meanings are 1) "God has established his kingdom among you" or 2) "God will soon establish his kingdom among you." The first is more likely. Languages that do not have a word for kingdom can translate it as "The time for God to rule has come."
