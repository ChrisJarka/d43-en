====== Introduction to Hebrews ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of Hebrews ===

  - Jesus is superior to God's prophets and angels (1:1-4:13)
  - Jesus is superior to the priests who minister in the temple of God in Jerusalem (4:14-7:28)
  - Jesus' ministry is superior to the old agreement which God made with his people through the law of Moses (8:1-10:31)
  - Jesus is superior in every way and practical instructions (10:32-13:17)
  - Encouragements and greetings (13:18-25)


=== What is the Book of Hebrews about? ===

The book of Hebrews is an encouraging letter which shows how Jesus fulfilled several Old Testament prophecies, to explain his role as the perfect High Priest, to encouraging to Jewish Christians and to explain that Jesus is better than anything that the Jewish religion has to offer.  Hebrews shows how Jesus completed the Law so that priests won't have to offer sacrifices ever again.  Jesus was the sacrifice for all sins, once and for all time. Christians in our time can also find encouragement in the letter to the Hebrews to keep following Jesus Christ as the one who makes it possible for us to trust in God.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Hebrews." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "The Letter to the Hebrews," or "A Letter to the Jewish Christians." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Hebrews? ===

No one knows who wrote Hebrews, but scholars have made suggestions such as the Apostle Paul, Luke, or Barnabas.  The date of writing is also not known but most believe it was written before 70 years after the birth of Christ.  Jerusalem was destroyed in 70, but the writer of this letter talks about Jerusalem like it was not yet destroyed.  Hebrews was written in the city of Rome and was probably circulated among several churches.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== How to translate this book without the Old Testament? ===

Jim, I thought about a note here about how the book cannot really be understood without a thorough knowledge of the levitical system.  Do you think there is a way to help translators with this, from your experience.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How do you translate the warning passages in Hebrews? ===

There are several passages in Hebrews which give the reader warning (2:1-4, 3:7-14, 5:11-6:20, 10:26-39, 12:15-17, and 12:25-29). Some scholars believe that these passages are about the possibility of losing one's salvation. Other scholars believe that the passages explains how true christians live. Still others believe that they are about the possible loss of rewards. Extra care must be taken in translating these passages, additional research may be required.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Hebrews? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of Hebrews:\\

  * "And set him over the works of Your hands." (2:7) Most manuscripts omit this phrase (so noted in the ULB).
  * "on those who were prisoners" (10:34). Some older versions read, "of me in my bonds"
  * "or shot with an arrow" (12:20). Most manuscripts omit this verse.

Translators are advised not to translate this last passage. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have it, it is not wrong to translate it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of Hebrews.
