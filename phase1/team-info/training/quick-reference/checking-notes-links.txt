====== Checking Notes and Links ======

This page contains info for the proof-readers of the Translation Notes (TN).

==== Links ====

We suggest that as you check the notes, you also open the following pages in new tabs in your browser:

  * [[:en:phase1:team-info:training:reviewers:talinks]] - contains links to TA pages in code blocks that can be safely pasted into Door43.
  * [[:en:phase1:team-info:training:quick-reference:quick-reference-notes]] - contains brief definitions of figures of speech, and links to standard notes pages. 

==== Sample Notes ====

IMPORTANT NOTE: Please DO NOT COPY the formatted text of these notes into Door43. It is safe to copy only the unformatted text in the code blocks. 

=== Verse References ===

See this page for more info: [[:en:phase1:team-info:training:reviewers:chunklinks]]

Note that in making links to verses, the first reference in the code is the verse that starts the chunk and the second is the verse you are pointing to:

  * **furnace of fire** - See how you translated this in 13:42.

<code>
  * **furnace of fire** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:40|13:42]].
</code>

  * **weeping and grinding of teeth** - See how you translated this in 8:12]].

<code>
  * **weeping and grinding of teeth** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:11|8:12]].

In this example, they are one and the same:
