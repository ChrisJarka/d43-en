\v 17 If there is a need, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.
\v 18 But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods with reverence, and we will not give the golden statue you set up our worship.
