\v 5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and stood in awe
of my name.
\v 6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and
uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.
\v 7 For the priestâ€™s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah
of hosts.
