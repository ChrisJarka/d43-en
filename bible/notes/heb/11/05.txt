\v 5 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God took him up because it was said of him before he was taken up that he had been well-pleasing to God:
\v 6 And without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing to him; for he that comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek after him.
