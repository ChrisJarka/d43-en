====== What Now? ======

**Changes to the text** - mention the necessary changes to the source text in the discussion area. The team lead will email the mentor/reviewer with a list of chunks with the source text comments.

**Difficult passages** - mention in the discussion panel the passage and a summary of the team's discussion. The team lead should email the mentor/reviewer about the passage and discussion for continued direction.

**Completed chunks** - when the team has taken the notes as far as they are able, the team leader should (carefully) change the tag from "draft" to "review" to signal the mentor/reviewer that the chunk is ready for the next phase.
