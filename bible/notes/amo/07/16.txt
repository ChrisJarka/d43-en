\q2 stop saying those things!'

\v 17 Therefore listen to what Yahweh says about you:
\q1 'Your wife will become a prostitute in this city,
\q2 and your sons and daughters will be killed by \add your enemies'\add* swords.
\q1 Others will measure your land
\q2 and divide it up \add among themselves\add*;

\v 16 You said to me, 'Do not prophesy and say that terrible things will happen to the people of Israel;
\q2 stop saying those things!'
\p
\v 17 So listen to what Yahweh says about you:
\q1 'Your wife will become a prostitute in this very city;
\q2 your sons and daughters will die because their enemies will kill them.
\q1 Others will measure your land
\q2 and divide it up among themselves;
\q1 and you yourself will die in a foreign country.
\q1 And the people of Israel will certainly have to leave their country and go into exile.'"

\v 16 Now hear the word of Yahweh. You say, 'Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not
speak against the house of Isaac.'
\v 17 Therefore this is what Yahweh says,
\q 'Your wife will be a prostitute in the city;
\q your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword;
\q your land will be measured and divided up;
\q you will die in an unclean land,
\q and Israel will surely go into exile from his land.'"
