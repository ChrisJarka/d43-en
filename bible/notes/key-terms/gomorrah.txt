====== Gomorrah ======

===== Facts: =====

Gomorrah was a city, along with the city of Sodom, in a fertile valley somewhere east of the region of Shinar, later known as Babylonia.

  * There were many kings at war in the region where Sodom and Gomorrah were located, and the family and followers of Lot, Abraham's nephew, got captured in the conflict because they lived in Sodom.
  * Abraham rescued Lot's people by fighting the superior warring kings and chasing them into the region of Dan.
  * Not long after the rescue of Lot, Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by God due to the wickedness in each city.
