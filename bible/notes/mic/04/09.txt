===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Now, why do you cry out aloud? Is there no king in you, is your counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of you like a woman in labor?** - Although Yahweh will save the people in the future, Micah uses these questions to emphasize that they are crying now because Yahweh is sending them away from the land of Israel as punishment for their sins.  AT: "Now, you cry out like a woman in labor because your king and wise men are gone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **Be in pain and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor** - Micah uses the image of a woman in labor to emphasize their terrible pain and cries. He means that they should be in pain because God is punishing them by sending them away from Israel. Many of them will never come home again.
    * **There you will be rescued There Yahweh will rescue you** - AT: "There Yahweh will rescue you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
