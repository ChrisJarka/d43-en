\v 12 They were very stubborn [IDI], and they would not listen to the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add* or the messages that the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels told his Spirit to give to the former prophets. So the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels was very angry.

\v 11 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.
\v 12 Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which Jehovah of hosts had
sent by his Spirit by the former prophets: therefore there came great wrath from Jehovah of hosts.
