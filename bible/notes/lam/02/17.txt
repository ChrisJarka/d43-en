    * **has not shown compassion**  - AT: "He acted harshly." (See: Litotes) 
    * **he has lifted up the strength of your adversaries** - The word that is translated “strength” here is literally the “horn” of an animal, which in this imagery God has made even more powerful. The horn is what an animal uses to attack and defend. See Lam. 2:3. (See: Metaphor)
