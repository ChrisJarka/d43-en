===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **broken … scattered **- Eliphaz uses the picture of a lion's teeth being broken and of a lion's family being scattered as an image of the wicked being destroyed. (see: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **The roaring of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions—they are broken.**  -  The roaring lion, the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions are all different phrases to describe one trait (see: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])  (also see: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The old lion perishes for lack of victims; the cubs of the lioness are scattered everywhere.**  - This is a poetic figure of speech in which two phrases say the same idea, or explain the same idea using different words (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
