\v 16 The people answered and said, "Never would forsake Yahweh to serve other gods.
\v 17 for it is Yahweh our God who brought us and our ancestors up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed.
\v 18 Then Yahweh drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land. So we also will serve Yahweh, for he is our God.
