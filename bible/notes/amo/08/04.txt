\v 4 Hear this, O you that would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail,
\v 5 saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the
ephah small, and the shekel great, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;
\v 6 that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?
