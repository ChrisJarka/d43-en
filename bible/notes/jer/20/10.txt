\v 10 For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him,
say all my familiar friends, they that watch for my fall; perhaps he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail
against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
\v 11 But Jehovah is with me as a mighty one and a terrible: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall
not prevail; they shall be utterly put to shame, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which
shall never be forgotten.
