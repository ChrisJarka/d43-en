<usfm>
\v 17 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says this \add about those people\add*: "They will be my people. On the day that I judge people, they will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a special treasure to me. I will be kind to them, like \f + \ft simile \f* fathers are kind to their sons who obey them.
\v 18 When that happens, you will again see that \add the manner in which I treat\add* righteous people is different from \add the manner in which I treat\add* wicked people. You will see that the manner in which I act toward those who serve me is different from the manner in which I act toward those who do not."

\v 17 And they shall be mine, says Jehovah of hosts, even mine own possession, in the day that I make; and I will
spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serves him.
\v 18 Then shall you return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serves God and him that serves
him not.
