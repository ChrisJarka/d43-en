\v 54 Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom you say, that he is
your God;
\v 55 and you have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar: but I
know him, and keep his word.
\v 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
