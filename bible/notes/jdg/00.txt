**What is Judges about?**\\

Judges is the history of the time from about 410 years from the Conquest of the land until the [[:en:obe:kt:death|death]] of Samson. The book of Judges about the most important judges who ruled over Israel. These accounts follow a strict design. There is an introduction to the account; the people do what is [[:en:obe:kt:evil]], an evil that usually remains hidden; Israel experiences difficulty and they fall under control of one of their enemies ; Israel call to Yahweh for help; Yahweh [[:en:obe:kt:raise|raises]] up a judge, a [[:en:obe:kt:deliver|deliverer]] who is filled with the [[:en:obe:kt:Spirit|Spirit]] of Yahweh; some victory over their enemies is achieved; then the judge dies; and the sequence is repeated until it is stopped by the giving of a king to the nation. The judges did not succeed in driving out the Canaanites under the judges. [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful|unfaithfulness]] to the covenant of Moses is important.
