\v 11 And every priest indeed stands day by day ministering and offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
\v 12 But he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
\v 13 waiting with expectation till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.
\v 14 For by one offering he has perfected for ever those who are sanctified.
