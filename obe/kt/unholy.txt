====== unholy, common, defiled ======

===== Definition: =====

Anything that is common or unholy has not been set apart by God as having special significance to Him.

  * Defilement is usually temporarily.
  * In the Bible, certain animals were considered unholy to God, meaning people should not eat their meat.
  * An example of a person who was considered holy by God but becomes temporarily defiled is when that person gets an illness (becomes defiled) and is separated from people to avoid spreading the illness. He is later considered to be holy again when he is healed.
