====== OBE: Future Tasks ======

This is a page for tracking OBE tasks that we want to do after the initial drafting of the terms is complete. Please use a bold title for each and provide a short explanation.

==== Task List: ====

**Update Bible References** - Remove tags to less important passages and make sure the most important references for the term are included in the list.

**Remove excess KT links** - Thin down the number of KT links in a passage so that "regular" terms only appear once per story/narrative, allowing the more important terms to stand out in the list.

**Update cross-links** - check that newer terms are cross-linked as needed to older pages.

**Create kings pages** - create "generic" pages with chronological lists of kings for Israel, Judah, etc. and cross-link to the KT pages for the individual kings.

**Maps** - There may need to be included in some of the OBE:OTHER terms maps for certain places, not necessarily because knowing the land of the Bible in important for translation, but it may be helpful to see where places are in relationship to each other.
