===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **synagogue attendant**  - This refers to a synagogue worker who made sure that the scrolls containing the Scriptures were brought out and put away with proper care and reverence.
    * **fixed on **- That is, "focused on" or "staring at."
    * **this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing**  - Jesus was saying that he was fulfilling that prophecy by his actions and speech at that very time.
    * **amazed **- That is, "surprised."
    * **Isn't this Joseph's son?**  - That is, "Isn't this just Joseph's son?" People thought that Joseph was Jesus' father. Joseph was not a religious leader, so they were surprised that his son would preach what he did. It could also be translated as, "This is just Joseph's son" or "His father is only Joseph." (See: Rhetorical Question).
