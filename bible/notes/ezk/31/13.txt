===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Birds settled\f + \ft Or: went to live \f* on the fallen tree, and wild animals lived among its branches.
\v 14 The result of what I have done is that no other trees, even if they have plenty of water, will ever grow very high and become proud, and lift their tops above the branches of other trees. I do not want any other tree to grow high like that cedar tree did; trees will all certainly die and decay in the ground, like people die and go down to their graves.

<usfm>
\v 13 Upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches;
\v 14 to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the
thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up in their height,
even all that drink water: for they are all delivered to death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of
the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
