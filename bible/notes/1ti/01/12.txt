\v 12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, because he gave me the strength to serve him. He also relies on me to serve him.
\v 13 In past times, I insulted and persecuted the believers. I did violent deeds, but God had mercy on me because I did not believe, and I did not know what I was doing.
\v 14 God was extremely kind to me, for he made me able to believe in Christ Jesus and love him.
