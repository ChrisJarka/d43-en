===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:love]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:flock]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my soul loves** - The soul is a metonym for the person. AT: "I love" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **feed your flock** - "graze your flocks"
  * **rest your flock** - "have your flock lie down"
  * **Why should I be like someone who wanders beside the flocks of your companions?** - The woman asks this question to emphasize that she has a closer relationship to her lover than other women do. AT: "Tell me so that I will not need to wander around among the flocks of your companions when I am looking for you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **wanders** - "goes all around." She does not want to have to look for her lover. Perhaps she is afraid other men will think she is a prostitute looking for business (see UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **companions** - "friends" or "co-workers"
