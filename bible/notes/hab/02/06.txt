\v 6 Will not all these people take up a parable against him and a taunting proverb regarding him, and say, 
\q 'Woe to the one increasing what is not his! For how long will you increase your the weight of the pledges you have taken?'

\q2 You will become a victim for them!
\q2
\v 8 Because you

\q2 on account of the blood of man and the violence done to the land, the village, and the inhabitants of it.
