====== Personification [pərˌsänəfiˈkāSHən] ======

Personification is a kind of simile or metaphor, in which an idea or something that is not alive is referred to as if it were a person and could do the things people do or have the attributes people have.


===== Purposes of Personification =====


===== Examples from English =====

**That delicious looking dessert is calling out to me "Eat me. Eat me."**
 
**The raging fire devoured everything in it's way.**

**Time waits for no one.**


===== Examples from the Bible =====
**He stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, “I want to. Be made clean.” Immediately the leprosy left him.** Luke 5:13b (WEB)\\ 
Luke wrote that __the leprosy left__ the sick man. People can leave and go somewhere else, but sicknesses don't leave a person and go somewhere else. So this is an example of personification. Another way to say this is "He no longer had leprosy."

**Wisdom is justified by all her children.”** Luke 7:35 (WEB)\\ 
Jesus said that wisdom is vindicated or proved right by her children. This was likely a proverb that was applicable to this situation. It is personification because wisdom is spoken of as though it were a woman that has children. This wisdom is God's wisdom, and wisdom's "children" are those who believe and follow wisdom. As a result of following God's wisdom they live wisely, and their wise behavior proves that God's wisdom is right. Jesus was probably saying that those who follow God's wisdom would follow what John and he were teaching, and their behavior would prove that John and he were teaching according to God's wisdom.

**He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”** Luke 7:50b (WEB)\\ 
Jesus told a woman that her __faith__, or trust, in God had __saved her__. People can save people, but abstract ideas like faith can't save anyone. So this is an example of personification.

**Therefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,** Luke 11:49 (WEB)\\
Jesus said that the __wisdom__ of God __said__, "I will send prophets"…. Here God's wisdom is personified as if it could speak.

**Jesus said to him, “Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.** Luke 19:9 (WEB)\\ 
Jesus said that __salvation had come__ to Zacchaeus's household. People can come to someone's house, but abstract ideas like salvation can't. So this is an example of personification.

**But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed. Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.** Luke23:23b, 24 (WEB)\\ 
Luke wrote that the __people's voices prevailed__, so Pilate decided to do what they were demanding him to do. In this personification, the people's voices and Pilate's voices are portrayed as if they are in a battle, and the people's shouting voices win the battle. Pilate would do what they wanted.

**But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief. You are all sons of light, and sons of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness,** 1 Thes 5:4, 5a, (WEB)\\ 
In this example of personification, the day or time of punishment is said to overtake people. A thief can overtake a person when that person is unaware and is not expecting him. In the same way, the time of punishment can happen at a time when people are unaware and not expecting it. Paul reminds the people that since they are aware, this will not happen to them.
