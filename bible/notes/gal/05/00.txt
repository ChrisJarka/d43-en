====== Galatians 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Paul begins this chapter still talking about the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]] as something that traps or enslaves a person.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Fruit of the Spirit ==
Many scholars have observed that the phrase "the fruit of the Spirit" is singular and not plural, even though it begin a list. This should remain in translation in a singular form if possible. Do not translate as "the fruits of the spirit."

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Illustrations ==
Paul uses several [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphors]] to illustrate his points. Running a race and yeast are two metaphors he uses in this chapter to help explain complicated issues.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Flesh ==

This is a complex issue and it is possible that “flesh” is a metaphor for a person's sinful nature. It is not the physical part of man that is sinful and it appears that Paul is teaching that while man remains alive (“in the flesh”), he will remain sinful regardless of his effort, but his new nature will be fighting against his old nature. Flesh is used in this chapter to contrast with that which is spiritual.

== "You are separated from Christ, all you who are "justified" by the law. You have fallen away from grace." ==
Some scholars believe that this teaches that this type of action causes a person to lose their salvation. It is more probable that Paul is saying these people have walked away from grace as a rule and exchange it for the law. 

The authors of the ULB have also chosen to place "justified" in quotation marks to indicate that this is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo|hypothetical situation]] and that no one is able to be justified by the law.
