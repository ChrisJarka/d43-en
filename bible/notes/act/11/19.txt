\v 19 After Stephen died, many of the believers left Jerusalem and went to other places because they were suffering there in Jerusalem. Some of them went to Phoenicia, some went to the Island of Cyprus, and others went to Antioch, a city in Syria. In those places they were continually telling people the message about Jesus, but they told only other Jewish people.
\v 20 Some of the believers were men from the Island of Cyprus and Cyrene city in north Africa. They went to Antioch and were also telling non-Jewish people about the Lord Jesus.
\v 21 The Lord God was powerfully enabling those believers to preach effectively. As a result, very many non-Jewish people believed their message and trusted in the Lord.

\v 19 Therefore the believers whom the suffering that began with Stephen's death scattered away from Jerusalemâ€”these believers went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch. They told the message about Jesus only to Jews, and to no one else. 
\v 20 But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, came to Antioch and spoke to Greeks also and preached the Lord Jesus.
\v 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them; a great number believed and turned to the Lord.
