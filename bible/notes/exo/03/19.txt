\v 19 But I know that the king of Egypt will allow you to go only if he sees that I am more powerful than he is.
\v 20 So I will use my power by performing many miracles there. Then he will allow you to leave.
\v 21 When this happens, I will cause the people of Egypt to honor the Hebrew people so that when you leave Egypt, they will give you what you need for the journey.
\v 22 At that time, each Hebrew woman will ask her Egyptian neighbor for what belongs to her. The Egyptians will give you all they have--silver and gold jewelry and clothing. You will put these things on your children. In this way, you will take everything from the Egyptians."

\v 19 But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, except if his hand is forced.
\v 20 I will put forth my hand and strike the Egyptians with all my wonders which I will do among them, and after that he will let you go.
\v 21 I will grant this people favor with the Egyptians, so when you depart, you shall not go empty-handed.
\v 22 Every woman shall ask her neighbor and of any woman staying in her house for jewels of silver and gold and for clothing. You will put them on your sons and daughters, and you shall plunder the Egyptians."
