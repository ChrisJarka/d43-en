=== What is the Book of Mark about? ===

The Gospel according to Mark is one of four books in the New Testament that describe the life of Jesus Christ.  Each one of them is called a “gospel,” which means “good news.” There are many opinions about the purpose of this book. It is probable that the book was written to defend the importance of Jesus after he died like a criminal. This would have also encouraged the Christians who were being persecuted in Rome. It was probably written to a Gentile, non-Christian audience.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Mark" may also be called "The Gospel according to Mark," "The Good News about Jesus that Mark wrote" or "This is what Mark wrote about Jesus."

=== Who wrote the Book of Matthew? ===

The book does not give the reader the name of the author. Since early on, the church has believed that the author is Mark, also known as John Mark. Mark was a close friend of Peter.  Although Mark was not an eyewitness to the life of Jesus, many believe that Peter’s testimony provided Mark with the information for this book. 


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
=== What is discipleship? ===

A large part of the religious environment of Israel surrounded the offering of sacrifices to Yahweh. Since Jesus offered his life as a sacrifice for the sins of man, the continued offering of animal sacrifices was no longer necessary. Faith is shown through following Jesus and the example he gave to his followers.

=== Text-Question ===

Text-Answer

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Matthew? ===
The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of more accurate manuscripts. The most significant issue in Mark concerns 16:9-20. This longer ending to Mark was probably added to the book to give the book a more logical conclusion. Verses 7:16, 9:44, 11:26 and 15:28 were not likely in the original text of the Book of Mark.

=== What are the synoptic gospels? ===
Why is this important to translate similar passages in the same way?  Chronology of events in the gospels.
