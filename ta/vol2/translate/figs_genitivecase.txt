===== Genitive Case =====

This module answers the question: What is genitive case?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: ['figs_intro']

<font inherit/arial, helvetica, sans-serif;;inherit;;rgb(255, 255, 255)>Genitive case shows the relationship between two nouns, when one noun is a part of/connected to/belongs to the second noun</font>
===== Translation Suggestions =====
<font inherit/arial, helvetica, sans-serif;;inherit;;rgb(255, 255, 255)>Genitive case can describe character, origin, possession, relationship, contents, or make up.  Make sure Your translation makes the relationship between the two nouns clear.  Ex: the love of Christ can mean the love Christ has or a person's love for Christ.  Be sure you understand the relationship of the nouns in the original and that your translation also makes that relationship clear.</font>
===== Examples in the Bible =====
Matt 19:14  But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the **kingdom of heaven**.
Eph 6:17 And take the **helmet of salvation,** and the **sword of the Spirit**, which is the **word of God**
===== Examples in English =====
English shows the genitive case two ways: an of-phrase (with the possessor noun second) or with the possessive 's (with the possessor noun first).
Depending on the version of the Bible, nouns of possession may be translated with either the possessive 's (such as God's word) or with 'of' (such as word of God)
The man's office
The dog's tail
The color of the car
The people of the town
