====== Gentile ======


===== Facts: =====


A Gentile is a person who is not an Israelite. That is, Gentiles are not descendants of Jacob or of his twelve sons.


    * In Scripture, Gentiles are occasionally referred to as the "uncircumcised" because many of them did not circumcise their male children as the Israelites did.
    * Because God chose the Israelites to be his special people, they thought of the Gentiles as outsiders.
    * Gentile could also be translated as "Non-Israelite", "Non-Jew" or "person from another nation."
