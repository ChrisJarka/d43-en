<usfm>
\v 6 For thus has Jehovah of hosts said, Hew you down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be
visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.
\v 7 As a well throws forth its waters, so she throws forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before
me continually is sickness and wounds.
\v 8 Be you instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you; lest I make you a desolation, a land not inhabited.
