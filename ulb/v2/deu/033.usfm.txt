\p
\v 1 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
\v 2 And he said,
\q Jehovah came from Sinai,
\q And rose from Seir to them;
\q He shined forth from mount Paran,
\q And he came from the ten thousands of holy ones:
\q At his right hand was a fiery law for them.
\q
\v 3 Yea, he loves the people;
\q All his saints are in your hand:
\q And they sat down at your feet;
\q Every one shall receive of your words.
\q
\v 4 Moses commanded us a law,
\q An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
\q
\v 5 And he was king in Jeshurun,
\q When the heads of the people were gathered,
\q All the tribes of Israel together.
\q
\v 6 Let Reuben live, and not die;
\q Nor let his men be few.
\p
\v 7 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said,
\q Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah,
\q And bring him in to his people.
\q With his hands he contended for himself;
\q And you shall be a help against his adversaries.
\p
\v 8 And of Levi he said,
\q Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one,
\q Whom you did prove at Massah,
\q With whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;
\q
\v 9 Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him;
\q Neither did he acknowledge his brethren,
\q Nor knew he his own children:
\q For they have observed your word,
\q And keep your covenant.
\q
\v 10 They shall teach Jacob your ordinances,
\q And Israel your law:
\q They shall put incense before thee,
\q And whole burnt offering upon your altar.
\q
\v 11 Bless, Jehovah, his substance,
\q And accept the work of his hands:
\q Strike through the loins of them that rise up against him,
\q And of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
\p
\v 12 Of Benjamin he said,
\q The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by him;
\q He covers him all the day long,
\q And he lives between his shoulders.
\p
\v 13 And of Joseph he said,
\q Blessed of Jehovah be his land,
\q For the precious things of heaven, for the dew,
\q And for the deep that coucheth beneath,
\q
\v 14 And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun,
\q And for the precious things of the growth of the moons,
\q
\v 15 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains,
\q And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
\q
\v 16 And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof,
\q And the good will of him that lived in the bush.
\q Let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph,
\q And upon the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
\q
\v 17 The firstling of his herd, majesty is his;
\q And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox:
\q With them he shall push the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth:
\q And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim,
\q And they are the thousands of Manasseh.
\p
\v 18 And of Zebulun he said,
\q Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;
\q And, Issachar, in your tents.
\q
\v 19 They shall call the peoples to the mountain;
\q There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness:
\q For they shall suck the abundance of the seas,
\q And the hidden treasures of the sand.
\p
\v 20 And of Gad he said,
\q Blessed be he that enlarges Gad:
\q He lives as a lioness,
\q And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.
\q
\v 21 And he provided the first part for himself,
\q For there was the lawgiver’s portion reserved;
\q And he came with the heads of the people;
\q He executed the righteousness of Jehovah,
\q And his ordinances with Israel.
\p
\v 22 And of Dan he said,
\q Dan is a lion’s whelp,
\q That leapeth forth from Bashan.
\p
\v 23 And of Naphtali he said,
\q O Naphtali, satisfied with favor,
\q And full with the blessing of Jehovah,
\q Possess you the west and the south.
\p
\v 24 And of Asher he said,
\q Blessed be Asher with children;
\q Let him be acceptable to his brethren,
\q And let him dip his foot in oil.
\q
\v 25 Your bars shall be iron and brass;
\q And as your days, so shall your strength be.
\q
\v 26 There is none like to God, O Jeshurun,
\q Who rideth upon the heavens for your help,
\q And in his excellency on the skies.
\q
\v 27 The eternal God is your dwelling-place,
\q And underneath are the everlasting arms.
\q And he thrust out the enemy from before thee,
\q And said, Destroy.
\q
\v 28 And Israel lives in safety,
\q The fountain of Jacob alone,
\q In a land of grain and new wine;
\q Yea, his heavens drop down dew.
\q
\v 29 Happy are thou, O Israel:
\q Who is like to thee, a people saved by Jehovah,
\q The shield of your help,
\q And the sword of your excellency!
\q And your enemies shall submit themselves to thee;
\q And you shall tread upon their high places.
