\v 11 And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey,
and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants: and now make you a covenant with us.
\v 12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold,
it is dry, and is become mouldy:
\v 13 and these wine-skins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are
become old by reason of the very long journey.
