It is too bad that although they knew how to conduct their lives in a righteous manner, they rejected the things that God commanded people to do, the things that were taught to them by us apostles.
\v 22 The way in which they are behaving again is just like the proverbs: They are like dogs that return to eat their vomit, and they are like pigs that have washed and then roll again in the mud.

\v 20 For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with them than the first.
\v 21 For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
\v 22 It has happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.
