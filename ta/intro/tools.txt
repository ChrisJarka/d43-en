===== Translation Tools =====

To help facilitate the translation and creation of Biblical content, unfoldingWord has created a number of tools:
  * [[en:ta:tech:door43|Door43]] - a website where translators can do online translating, also the content management system for unfoldingWord
  * [[en:ta:tech:ts|translationStudio]] - a mobile app where translators can do offline translating
  * [[en:ta:tech:tk|translationKeyboard]] - a mobile app where users can create custom keyboards for languages not supported by their mobile device
  * [[en:ta:tech:uw|unfoldingWord app]] - a mobile app where checked unfoldingWord translations are published and distributed
  * [[en:ta:tech:dpe|Digital Publishing Engine]] - a system of pushing checked translations to the unfoldingWord website and app and creating print-ready documents of the content
