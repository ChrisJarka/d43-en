Description 
Ordinal numbers are numbers that tell either the position of something in a list or the order in which things happens. 
The first lot went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, the third to Harim, ...  the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.  (1 Chronicles 24:7-18) 
 
Most ordinal numbers in English simply have  "-th" added to the end.

 Some ordinal numbers in English do not follow that pattern.

Reason this is a translation issue 
Some languages do not have special numbers for showing the order of items in a list. There are different ways to deal with this. 
 
Examples from the Bible 
Ordinal numbers are used in the Bible mainly to tell the position of something in a list. 
This was an evening and morning, the first day.  (Genesis 1:5) 
This was an evening and morning, the second day. (Genesis 1:8) 
 
The name of the first river is Pishon. (Genesis 2:11) 
The name of the second river is Gihon. (Genesis 2:13) 
 
He gave to the church first apostles, second, prophets, third teachers, then those who do powerful deeds... (1 Corinthians 12:28) 
 
 
 
Translation Strategies 
If your language has ordinal numbers, consider using them. If not, here are some strategies to consider. 
1  Use the word "number" along with the number. 
2 Tell the total number of items, and then use "one" with the first item and "another" or "the next" with the rest.  
3  Simply tell the number of items and list the things associated with them.
