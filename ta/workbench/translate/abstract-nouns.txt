===== Description =====

Remember that nouns are words that refer to a person, place, thing, or idea. **ABSTRACT NOUNS** are nouns that refer to things that cannot be seen, heard, tasted, smelled or touched in a physical sense. Ideas and things like 'peace' are real, but cannot be seen or touched in a physical sense. 

**Examples of Abstract Nouns**: \\ joy, peace, creation, goodness, contentment, justice, attitude, freedom, vengeance\\
Hint: English uses common word endings (suffixes) that may help identify abstract nouns. They include such endings as: -tion; -ism; -ity; -ment; -ness; -age; -ance; -ence; -ship; -ability; -acy

Purpose (optional)\\

**Reason this is a translation issue**: The Bible that you translate from may use abstract nouns to express certain ideas. Your language might not use abstract nouns for some of those ideas; instead, it might use other kinds of words such as adjectives, verbs, or adverbs or even sentences to express them.

===== Examples from the Bible =====
===== Translation Strategy =====
If your language can use an abstract noun consider using it. This strategy is for if your language cannot use one.
  - Reword the sentence with a phrase that expresses the meaning of the abstract noun.
