====== Titus 02:6-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 As for the younger men, similarly, urge them to control themselves \add in all that they say and do\add*.
\v 7 You yourself must continually do what is good in order that others will see how they should behave. Teach \add the believers\add* sincerely and seriously;
\v 8 teach what is correct and what no one can \add justly\add* criticize. \add Do this\add* in order that \add when the believers\add* conduct their lives\add in a proper manner\add*, anyone who opposes \add us\f + \ft Or: our message\add* \f* will be disappointed because there will be nothing bad that they can \add justly\add* say about us.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 And concerning the younger men, teach them, too. Tell them to control themselves well.
\v 7 As for you,Titus, my son, always show others people how to do good deeds;  show them that you teach the believers honestly what is true and good and about God.
\v 8 Teach people in a way that no one can criticize, so that if anybody wants to stop you, other people will shame him because he has nothing bad to say about us.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 In the same way, call the younger men to be sensible.
\v 7 In all ways present yourself as a model of good works; and when you teach, show integrity and  dignity.
\v 8 Speak words that do not need to be corrected but that would bring shame upon someone if he tried to oppose you, because there is nothing evil to say about us.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **In the same way** - This refers back to the training of women in the church. Titus was to train the men in a similar manner.
  * **call** - "teach" or "tell" or "exhort"
  * **present yourself** - AT: "You should be" or "Show yourself to be"
  * **a model of good works** - "an example of one who does right and proper things"
  * **would bring shame upon someone if he tried to oppose you** - This presents a hypothetical situation where someone opposes Titus and as a result is shamed himself. It is not expressing something that actually happened. Your language may have a way of expressing this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
