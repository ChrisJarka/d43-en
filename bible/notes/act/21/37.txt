===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **As Paul was about to be brought **- "When the soldiers were ready to bring Paul"
  * **the fortress **- The place where soldiers live. It is a military camp or building.
  * **the chief captain **- The military officer or leader of about 600 to 1000 soldiers.
  * **Egyptian - **  This unnamed man from Egypt went to Judea to start a revolt in the latter part of the 50s AD, that is, not long before Paul's visit to Jerusalem. The Egyptian led a band of 4000 rebels to the Mount of Olives, opposite Jerusalem. There he claimed he was going to make the walls of the city miraculously fall while they watched. The Roman army stationed there routed the group, but the "Egyptian" escaped "into the desert" - this is why the commander thinks that Paul might be the same man.
  * **terrorists **- Those who are armed with an intent to kill and harm the foreign soldiers in their land.
