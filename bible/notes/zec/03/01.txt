====== Zechariah 03:1-3 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Then \add Yahweh\add* showed me Joshua, the Supreme Priest, who was standing in front of the angel that Yahweh had sent. And Satan was standing at Joshua's right side, ready to accuse him.
\v 2 But Yahweh said to Satan, "Satan, I am rebuking you! I am the one who has chosen Jerusalem \add to be my special city\add*, and I am rebuking you! This man, \add Joshua\add*, \add has been brought back from Babylonia\add*; he is surely like \f + \ft metaphor, rhetorical question \f* a burning stick that has been snatched from a fire."
\p
\v 3 Joshua was wearing filthy clothes while he was standing in front of the angel.

\v 1 Then Yahweh showed me Joshua, the high priest, who was standing in front of the angel that Yahweh had sent. And Satan was standing at Joshua's right side, ready to accuse him of having sinned.
\v 2 But the angel of Yahweh said to Satan, "Satan, may Yahweh rebuke you! He has chosen Jerusalem to be his special city, and may he rebuke you! This man, Joshua, has been brought back from Babylonia; he is certainly like a burning stick that someone has snatched from a fire."
\p
\v 3 Now as Joshua was standing in front of the angel, he was wearing filthy clothes.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh and Satan was standing at his right hand to accuse him of sin.
\v 2 The angel of Yahweh said to Satan, "May Yahweh rebuke you, Satan; may Yahweh, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is this not a brand pulled from the fire?"
\v 3 Joshua was dressed in filthy garments as he stood before the angel.
