\v 11 Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
\v 12 Prove your servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
\v 13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the kingâ€™s dainties;
and as you seest, deal with your servants.
