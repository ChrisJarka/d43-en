===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 38 Give good things to others, and then God will give good things to you. It will be like he is giving you a generous amount of grain, pressing it down in a basket and shaking the basket to make sure it is completely full, to the point that some of the grain even spills over the sides! Remember that the standard you use to judge or bless others will be the standard God uses to judge or bless you!"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 38 Give to others, and it will be given to you. A generous amount -- pressed down, shaken together and spilling over -- they will pour into your lap. For with whatever standard of measure you use to measure with, that same standard will be used to measure for you.
