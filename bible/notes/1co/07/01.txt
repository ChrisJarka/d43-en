\v 1 You wrote to me some questions about how married believers should live. Here is my answer. There may be times in which it is good to abstain from sexual relations in marriage.
\v 2 But people are tempted very often to be sexually immoral. So each husband should have his own wife, and each wife should have her own husband.
