\c 10
\p
\v 1 Brethren, my heart’s desire and my supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved.
\v 2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
\v 3 For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the
righteousness of God.
\v 4 For Christ is the end of the law to righteousness to every one that believeth.
\v 5 For Moses writes that the man that does the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby.
\v 6 But the righteousness which is of faith says thus, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring
Christ down:)
\v 7 or, Who shall descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)
\v 8 But what says it? The word is near thee, in your mouth, and in your heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:
\v 9 because if you shall confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and shall believe in your heart that God raised him
from the dead, you shall be saved:
\v 10 for with the heart man believes to righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.
\v 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believes on him shall not be put to shame.
\v 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same
Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all that call upon him:
\v 13 for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
\v 14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not
heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
\v 15 and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad
tidings of good things!
\p
\v 16 But they did not all listen to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who has believed our report?
\v 17 So belief comes of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
\v 18 But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, verily,
\q Their sound went out into all the earth,
\q And their words to the ends of the world.
\m
\v 19 But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses saith,
\q I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation,
\q With a nation void of understanding will I anger you.
\m
\v 20 And Isaiah is very bold, and saith,
\q I was found of them that sought me not;
\q I became manifest to them that asked not of me.
\m
\v 21 But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I spread out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.
