=== What is the Book of Mark about? ===

The Gospel according to Mark is one of four books in the New Testament that describe the life of Jesus Christ.  Each one of them is called a “gospel,” which means “good news.” Many scholars believe that it was written in Rome with the purpose of encouraging Roman Christians there.  In the Gospel, Mark focuses on discipleship and Jesus’ teaching on the end times.


=== Who wrote the Book of Mark? ===

Mark, also known as John Mark, was a companion to the Apostle Paul and Barnabas but his reputation was hurt when he abandoned their missionary journey (Acts 13:13).  Later Mark traveled again with Barnabas (Acts 15:37-39). Mark was also recognized as a close friend of Peter (1 Peter 5:13).  Although Mark was not an eyewitness to the life of Jesus, scholars believe that Mark recorded much of Peter’s testimony and that is the basis for The Gospel according to Mark.
