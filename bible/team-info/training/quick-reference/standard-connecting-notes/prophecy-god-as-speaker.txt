====== Prophecy: Identifying God as the Speaker ======

===== Description =====

In prophetic material there are often several layers of embedded quotes. For example Isaiah 7:1-2 says: \\ 
  * The word of Yahweh came to me and said, "You, Son of man--thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel: 'An end! An end has come to the four borders of the land!

The following chunk starts with: \\ 
  * Now the end is upon you, for I am sending out my wrath on you,

Instead of writing notes saying who the words "I" and "you" refer to, we can write a connecting note like the following: "These are Yahweh's words to Israel." It's true that Yahweh was speaking to Ezekiel, but in his message he was addressing the people of Israel.

Sometimes it is not clear who the audience is. In Ezekiel 7:10-27, the speaker is still God, and he is still speaking about Israel, but he refers to the people of Israel as "they" rather than "you." His audience could be either Ezekiel or the people of Israel. In such a case, the following connecting note might be sufficient: "These are Yahweh's words about Israel."

When it's clear to us who God's audience is, and when he is speaking about someone else, we could have a note like this. These are Yahweh's words to Ezekiel about Israel. \\ 

We would only need these notes when there is nothing like "Yahweh said to me."

When writing the notes, replace "[the audience]" with the identity of the intended audience, such as "Israel" or "Babylon." Replace [the people/nation he was speaking about]" with the name of that group, such as "Israel" or "Babylon."
