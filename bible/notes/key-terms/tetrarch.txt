====== tetrarch ======


===== Definition: =====


A tetrarch was a governing official in the Roman Empire who ruled one of four divisions of a state. The tetrarchs were under the authority of the Roman Caesar. The modern equivalent corresponds roughly to that of a lieutenant governor or perhaps the mayor of a large city.   

    * "Tetrarch" could also be translated as "prince."
