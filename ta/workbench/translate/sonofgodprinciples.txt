==== Reasons the words Father and Son must be translated literally ====

1. **The names Father and Son are chosen by God himself and revealed in the Bible, the word of God.**
>Jesus said, "I praise you __Father__, Lord of heaven and earth,... no one knows the __Son__ except the __Father__, and no one knows the __Father__ except the __Son__..." (Matthew 11:25-27 ULB) (See also: John 6:26-57 ULB)
The terms 'Father' and 'Son' have been found by theologians to be irreplaceable, because any other terms end up suggesting incorrect things about God. No one should try to replace them in translation.

2. **The words "Father" and "Son" show God's Persons exist in an __eternal__, infinite, loving relationship.**
>"__The Father loves the Son__." (John 3:35-36; 5:19-20 ULB)\\ 
>Jesus said, "__Father__, __glorify your Son__ so that t__he Son may glorify you__... I glorified you on the earth,... Now Father, glorify me along with your own self with the glory that __I had with you before the world was created__." (John 17:1-5 ULB)
Father, Son, and Spirit have eternally loved one another. Human fathers and sons should love as God loves. The language chosen by God to describe his Persons is chosen according to God's characteristics, not man's. Human fathers and sons, and man's limited ability to generate life, exist because God created humanity in his image. 'Father' and 'Son' language describing God’s Persons originates from the realities of God, not from any need to mirror human realities. 

3. **God’s Father-Son relationship was created into humanity as part of the image of God in mankind.**
>God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..." God created man in his own image... Male and female... (Genesis 1:26 ULB)
>This is my commandment, that you should love one another as I have loved you. (John 15:12 ULB) 
>God deals with you as with sons, for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?... Should we not... obey the Father of spirits and live? (Hebrews 12:7-9 ULB)
>Children, obey your parents in the Lord... "Honor your father and mother"... fathers, do not provoke your children to anger… raise them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. Ephesians 6:1-4
God has chosen to reveal himself through normal family relationships. We cannot fully understand the depths of the relationship between God the Father and God the Son, but by translating with words that best represent the relationship between human fathers and sons, God speaks in the way he has chosen.

4. **The eternal Son humbled himself 2000 years ago. Jesus' mother was Mary, but his father was God.**
>"Then Mary said, 'How will this happen, since I am a virgin?' The angel answered her, 'The __Holy Spirit__ will come over you and the power of the __Most High__ will overshadow you. Therefore, the holy one who will be born will be called the __Son of God__.' " (Luke 1:34-35 ULB)\\ 
>"__Christ Jesus__... did not consider his __equality with God__ as something to hold on to. But instead he emptied himself... in the likeness of men he humbled himself... to the death of the cross." (Philippians 2:5-8 ULB)\\  
Christ is termed "son of the Most High" because the Holy Spirit miraculously placed him in Mary's womb, introducing his temporal mission to be born as a human and provide salvation for humanity.

5. **God the Father adopts believers in Christ as his 'sons'.** (Galatians 4:4-6)\\
>"God so loved the world, that he gave __his only unique Son__, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. God did not send the __Son__... to condemn the world, but so that the world should be saved... He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been condemned already because he has not believed __in the name of the unique Son of God__." (John 3:16-18 ULB)\\
>"God... sent his own __Son__... to be an offering for sin, and he condemned sin in the flesh." (Romans 8:3 ULB)\\
>"... we were reconciled to God through the death of his __Son__,... saved by his life." (Romans 5:10 ULB)
