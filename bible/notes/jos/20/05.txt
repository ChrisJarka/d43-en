\v 5 If some relative of the one who was killed comes to that city to get revenge, the leaders of that city must not allow the relative to take the killer, because what happened was accidental. He did not deliberately hate that person and as a result deliberately kill him.
\v 6 But the person who killed someone else must stay in that city until the city judges put him on trial. \add Only\add* if the judges decide \add that the person who has run\f + \ft Or: escaped \f* to their city did not deliberately kill the other person will they allow him to stay in that city\add*, and he must stay there until the supreme priest dies. Then he may safely go back to his own town, \add because the death of the supreme priest will be considered to atone\f + \ft Or: pay \f* for the death of the person who was killed\add*."

\v 5 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he struck
his neighbor unawares, and hated him not beforetime.
\v 6 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest
that shall be in those days: then shall the manslayer return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city
from whence he fled.
