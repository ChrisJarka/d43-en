\v 26 Corpses of all the soldiers of the lands of Meshech and Tubal will be there, surrounded by the graves of a huge crowd of their people. While they were alive, they also caused people in many places to be terrified. They were all godless people whom their enemies will have killed. When they were still alive, they also terrified people in many places. They will surely lie there, along with other godless soldiers who have died. Their shields will be with their bodies, and their swords will lie under their heads.
\v 27 While they were alive, they terrified many people on earth, so I will be punish them for their sins.

\v 26 Meshech, Tubal, and all their entourage are there! Their graves surround them!
\q All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword, because they had brought their terrors on the land of the living!
\q
\v 27 Do they not lie with the fallen warriors of the uncircumcised who have gone down to Sheol
\q With all their weapons of war, and with their swords placed under their heads
\q And their shields placed on their bones? For they were the terror of warriors in the land of the living!
