\v 20 And they went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and
they told all the words in the ears of the king.
\v 21 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it
in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king.
\v 22 Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month: and
there was a fire in the brazier burning before him.
