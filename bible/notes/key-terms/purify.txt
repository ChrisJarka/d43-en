==== (purify, purification) ====
===== Definition: =====


To purify something is to make it pure and free from anything that contaminates or pollutes it. In the Bible, "purification" is mainly cleansing from things that make an object or a person ritually unclean and unfit to be in  God's presence.

    * The Old Testament has many laws about how a person could be purified from unclean things like illness, contact with a dead body, contact with body fluids, or childbirth. 
    * The Old Testament also has laws about a person could be purified from sin.
    * These laws often involved a waiting period, ceremonial washing, or the sacrifice of an animal.
    * The New Testament teaches that people who trust in Jesus are purified from their sin by Jesus' sacrifice.
