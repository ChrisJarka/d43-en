\v 28 They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered not into the
Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.
\v 29 Pilate therefore went out to them, and saith, What accusation bring you against this man?
\v 30 They answered and said to him, If this man were not an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him up to thee.
