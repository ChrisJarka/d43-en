====== 1 Corinthians 14 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 14:21, which are a quotation from the Old Testament.

Paul returns to his discussion on the  gifts of the Holy Spirit.


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

**Use of the Gifts of the Holy Spirit in the church services**

The Gifts of the Holy Spirit should be used to help the whole Church, such as prophecy. Speaking in an unknown language only helps the speaker and confuses outsiders who hear it. Someone with the gift of speaking in strange languages should ask God for the gift of interpretation as well because then it will help the whole church. If everyone is speaking in a strange language, an unbeliever who comes in will think you are insane but if everyone prophesizes he will be convicted and say that God is among you. 

In a church service one person at a time should have a song or a prophecy or speak in a strange language but only speak in a strange language if there is someone who can interpret it. People should speak one at a time and if a prophecy comes to a person when someone else is speaking, the speaker should stop and let the other person say what he has received. Everything should be done in an orderly fashion. Women should not speak in church. If they have a question, they should wait until they go home and ask their husband.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

**metaphor**

This chapter uses one [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]: Like a musical needs to make an understandable sound, people need to say understandable things.

**rhetorical question**

Paul ends the chapter with two [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]s used to scold the people for their pride. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===
