===== Recommended Software =====

This module answers the question: Would you be so bold as to recommend any software?\\
Module â€“ Recommended Software

The software listed in this module are our recommendations for the completing tasks in each of the respective categories. The software is selected based on design, functionality, ease of use, intuitive user interface and cost effectiveness. We are especially appreciative and gravitate toward excellent open-source or free software whenever possible, knowing that costs and licensing are typically an access barrier for the global Church.
