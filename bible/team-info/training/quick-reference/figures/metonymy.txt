===== Bible Examples =====

=== Gen:06:08 ===

"But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh."

  * **in the eyes of Yahweh**  - This is metonymy. It can be translated as "in Yahweh's sight" or "in Yahweh's thoughts" or "Yahweh looked" as in the note above this one. Though Yahweh does not have physical eyes, he sees. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])

=== Luk:11:17 ===

"But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and a house divided against itself falls."

  * **a house divided against itself falls**  - "a family whose members fight each other will be ruined" or "a family whose members fight each other will be stop being a family." The word "house" is used to refer to a family or to the people living in a house. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])

=== Gal:05:02 ===

"Look, I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will not benefit you in any way."

  * **if you become circumcised**  - "if you return to the Jewish religion." Paul is using circumcision as metonymy for Judaism. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])
