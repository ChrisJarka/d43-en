\v 12 Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah, saying,
\v 13 Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you
not receive instruction to listen to my words? says Jehovah.
\v 14 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day
they drink none, for they obey their fatherâ€™s commandment. But I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; and you
have not listened to me.
