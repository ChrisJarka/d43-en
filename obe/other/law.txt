====== law, principle ======

===== Definition: =====

A law is a guide for how to live that is typically written down and enforced by legal representatives from within a cultural group. Principles are different from laws in that principles are guidelines that do not have legal consequences.

  * Judges and lawyers are often the representatives who receive specialized training to be able to interpret and refine man's system of law. Judges also pass down penalties for the breaking of laws.
  * Typically most cultures have a group of people enlisted, such as the police, who ensure laws are followed, and detain those who break the law to be prosecuted.
  * God's principles are not the same as man's laws, and as Christians, we are subject to God's principles first. God's principles are sometimes also called laws because they are universally applicable for all men.
