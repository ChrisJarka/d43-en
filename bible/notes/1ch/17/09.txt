<usfm>
\v 9-10 Formerly, during the time that I appointed leaders for my Israelite people, many violent groups oppressed them. But this will not happen anymore. I have chosen a place where my Israelite people can live \add peacefully\add* and no one will disturb them anymore. I will give them rest from \add being attacked by\add* their enemies. And I will defeat all your enemies.
\pi I declare to you that I, Yahweh, will enable your descendants to rule after you \add die\add*.

<usfm>
\v 9 I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them there, so that they may live in their own place and be troubled no more. No longer will wicked people oppress them, as they did before,
\v 10 as they were doing from the days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Then I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that I, Yahweh, will build you a house.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - God continues describing his promises to King David through the prophet Nathan.
  * **General Information:** - The words "your" and "you" in these verses refer to David.

  * **I will appoint a place** - "I will choose a place"
  * **will plant them there** - God causing the people to live in the land permanently and securely is spoken of as if he would plant them in the land. AT: "I will settle them there" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and be troubled no more** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "and no one will ever trouble them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from the days** - Here "days" represents a longer period of time. AT: "from the time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I commanded judges** - After the people of Israel entered the land of Canaan and before they had kings to rule them, God appointed leaders called "judges" to lead them in times of trouble.
  * **to be over my people Israel** - To be in authority is referred to as being over someone. AT: "to rule my people Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **subdue** - to make a person or animal unable to attack
  * **I will build you a house** - Here the metonym "house" refers to David's ancestors continuing on as the rulers of Israel. In [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:17:03|17:4]] God told David he would not be the one to build a house for Yahweh. There "house" represented a temple. If your language has a word that can express both ideas, use it here and in 17:4. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
