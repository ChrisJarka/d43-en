====== Esther ======

===== Facts: =====

Esther, also known as Hadassah, was an orphan who was raised by her Jewish uncle Mordecai and married the Persian king Ahasuerus (Xerxes) sometime around the year 480 BC.

  * The Old Testament book of Esther tells the history of how the Jewess Esther married king Xerxes and saved the Jewish people who lived in the Persian empire from death.
  * The Jewish people were to be killed because Queen Esther's Jewish uncle Mordecai did not bow before Haman, who served the king.
  * In anger, Haman had the king decree death to all of the Jews in the land of Persia on a certain date.
  * Queen Esther told the king about the plot.
  * Since a king could not cancel an existing kingly order, he decreed that the Jews could defend themselves, and thus the Jewish people were saved.
