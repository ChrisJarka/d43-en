===== translationNotes: =====

  * **See, I am against you** - Here Yahweh begins to speak.
  * **See** - "Look" or "Listen." This word adds emphasis to what is said next. AT: "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **the sword will devour your young lions** - Here the word "sword" is a metonym for soldiers who attack with swords and is spoken of as if it were a person who eats its victims. Nahum also continues to speak of the people of Nineveh as if they were lions. AT: "attackers will kill your people with swords" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will cut off your plunder from your land** - The word "plunder" refers to the wealth that Nineveh captured and brought from other lands. Yahweh speaks of causing the people of Nineveh to return the plunder that they stole as if he were cutting off the plunder, as one would cut a branch from a tree. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the voices of your messengers will be heard no more** - This likely refers to the messengers that the Assyrians sent out to other nations to demand surrender or payment of tribute. This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one will ever hear the voices of your messengers again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
