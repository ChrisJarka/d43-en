====== witness, eyewitness ======

===== Definition: =====

A witness is someone who has seen or heard something happen. Sometimes the term "eyewitness" is used to emphasize that the person has actually experienced what happened.

  * During a trial, witnesses tell what they have seen or heard. What the witnesses say helps the judge to decide if the person being accused is guilty or innocent.
  * Witnesses are expected to tell the truth about what they have seen or heard.
  * A witness who does not tell the truth about what happened is called a "false witness."
