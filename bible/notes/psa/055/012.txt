\v 12 If it were an enemy who was making fun of me,

\q2 I could hide from him.
\q1
\v 13 But it is someone who is just like me, my companion,
\q2 someone who was my friend \add who is doing this to me\add*.

<usfm>
\q
\v 12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me;
\q Then I could have borne it:
\q Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me;
\q Then I would have hid myself from him:
\q
\v 13 But it was thou, a man mine equal,
\q My companion, and my familiar friend.
\q
\v 14 We took sweet counsel together;
\q We walked in the house of God with the throng.
</usfm>
