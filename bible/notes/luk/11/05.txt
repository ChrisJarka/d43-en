\v 5 And He said to them, "Which of you, shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight and say to him, "Friend, lend to me three loaves
*
\v 6 since* a friend of mine came to me from the road and I have nothing to set before him.
*
\v 7 And the one inside answering said, "Do not bother me. The door is already shut and my children are with me in bed. I am not able to give to you rising up*.

\v 8 I say to you if he does not give to him rising up because he is his friend, because of his*  shameless persistence rising up he shall give to him as many as he needs.
