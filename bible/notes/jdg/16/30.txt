\v 30  Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines.” He bowed with all his might, and the building fell on the
lords and on all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his own death were more than those whom  he had killed in his life.
\v 31 Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, took him, brought him back, and buried him between
Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial place of Manoah, his father. He had judged Israel for twenty years.
