====== oath, swear ======

===== Definition: =====

An oath is a formal promise to do something or tell the truth.  To swear is to say that what is being said is true.

  * Modern use of the word swear includes cursing, but this meaning is not used in the Bible.
  * During Peter's denial of Christ,  several people accuse Peter of being one of Christ's followers.  Peter curses and swears saying, "I do not know the man!"  The word "swears" means that Peter is saying (falsely) that he telling the truth.
