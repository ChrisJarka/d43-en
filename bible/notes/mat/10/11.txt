===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 11-12 In any town or village that you enter, find a person who wants you to stay in his home. As you go into that house, call upon God to do good to the people who live there. Stay in that home until you leave that town or village. \v 13 If the people who live in that house receive you well, God will indeed do good to them. But if they do not receive you well, then your prayer will not help them, and God will not do them good. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 11 Whatever city or village you enter, find who is worthy in it, and stay there until you leave. \v 12 As you enter into the house, greet it. \v 13 If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace come back to you. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Whatever city or village you enter **- This can be translated "Whenever you enter a city or village" or "Everywhere you go."
  * **city **- This can be translated "town" or "large village." It refers to a population center of greater importance than a village.
  * **village **- This refers to a small population center.
  * **you, your **- These pronouns refer to the twelve apostles.
  * **the house**  - This is a metonym that refers to the people who live in the house. (See: Metonymy)
  * **greet it **- This can be translated "greet the people who live in it." A common greeting in those days was "Peace be to this house!"
  * **If the house is worthy**  - "If the people of that house receive you well" or "If the people who live in that house receive you well" (UDB)
  * **let your peace come upon it - **  "let peace come upon it" (See UDB)
  * **your peace - **  This refers to the peace that the apostles asked God to bring upon that house.
  * **if it is not worthy**  - "if they do not receive you well" (UDB)
  * **let your peace come back to you**  - This could have one of two meanings. (1) If the household was not worthy, then God would hold back peace or blessings from that household, as expressed in the UDB. (2) If the household was not worthy, then the apostles were supposed to do something, such as asking God not to honor their greeting of peace. If your language has a similar meaning of taking back a greeting or its effects, that should be used here.
