====== Parallelism ======

===== Description =====

In **parallelism** two clauses that are similar in grammatical structure or idea are used together. Sometimes the two clauses mean basically the same thing. Sometimes the second clarifies the meaning of the first. Sometimes the second says something that contrasts with the first. 

Parallelism is most commonly found in the book of Psalms and Proverbs but is found throughout the whole of the Hebrew Bible.

===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.


=== Genesis 22:12 ===

"He said, "Do not lay your hand upon the lad, nor do anything to harm him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing that you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.""

  * **(1) Do not lay your hand upon the lad, nor do anything to harm him**  - **(3)**  Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. God made sure that Abraham would hear and understand him. **(4)** Alternate translation: "Do not hurt the boy in any way." **(5)**  (See: Parallelism)

=== Ruth 2:12 ===

"May Yahweh reward you for your deed. May you receive full payment from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have found refuge."

  * **(1) May you receive full payment from Yahweh**  - **(3)**  This is a poetic expression that is very similar to the previous sentence. **(4)** Alternate translation: "May Yahweh give back to you even more than you have given." **(5)** (See: Parallelism)

=== Ruth 2:19 ===

"And her mother-in-law said to her, "Where have you gleaned today? And where did you go to work?"

  * **(1) Where have you gleaned today? And where did you go to work?**  - **(3)**  The Hebrews often repeated things in different words as a way of emphasis. **(4)** Alternate translation: "where have you worked and gleaned today?" **(5)** (See: Parallelism)

=== Matthew 10:27===

  * **What I tell you in the darkness, say in the daylight, and what you hear softly in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops** - This parallelism can also be translated as “Tell people in the daylight what I tell you in the darkness, and proclaim upon the housetops what you hear softly in your ear.” (See: Parallelism)

=== Matthew 13:13 (This one might be too complex. Not just parallelism) ===

So I talk to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, neither do they understand. 

  * **because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear** - "though they see, they do not see, and though they hear, they do not hear." Jesus uses this parallelism to tell the disciples that the crowd refuses to understand. Alternate translation "Though they see things happen, they do not understand what they mean, and though they hear instruction, they do not understand the truth." (See: Parallelism)


=== Luke 12:2 ===

"But there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known."

  * **(1) nothing concealed...revealed, and nothing hidden...made known**  - **(3)**  This sentence uses different words in the second half to say the same thing as the first half in order to emphasize its truth. **(4)**  Use similar phrases to translate this sentence in order to keep the same pattern. **(5)** (See: Parallelism)

Another way to deal with parallelism is to have a separate note for each part of the pair. This is especially helpful when there are more translation issues involved.

  * **There is nothing concealed that will not be revealed**  - This could also be translated as "Everything that is hidden will be shown" or "People will find out about everything that people do secretly."
  * **and nothing hidden, that will not be made known**  - This part of the sentence uses different words to say the same thing as the first part in order to emphasize its truth. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:parallelism]])


===Romans 10:18 
But I say, "Did they not hear?" Yes, most certainly.
"Their sound has gone out into all the earth,
And their words to the ends of the world."

  * **Their sound has gone out into all the earth**  -The word “their” refers to the sun, moon, and stars. Here they are described as human messengers that tell people about God. This refers to how their existence testifies to God's power and glory. It can be made explicit that Paul is quoting Scripture here. Alternate translation: “As it is written in the Scriptures, 'The sun, moon, and the stars are proof of God's power and glory, and everyone in the world sees them and knows the truth about God.'”

  * **And their words to the ends of the world** - Both of these statements mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. (See: Parallelism and Personification and Explicit and Implicit Information)
