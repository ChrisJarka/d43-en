\v 6 Because you are now God's children, he sent the Spirit of his Son to live in each of us. It is his Spirit who enables us to call God, "Father, our dear Father!" This shows that we are God's children.
\v 7 So, because of what God has done, no longer is each of you like a slave. Instead, each of you is a child of God. Since each of you is now God's child, God will also give you all that he has promised. God himself will do it!

<usfm>
\v 6 Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls, "Abba, Father."
\v 7 For this reason you are no longer a slave but a son, and if you are a son, then you are also an heir through God.
