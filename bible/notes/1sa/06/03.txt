\v 3 And they said, If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but by all means return him a
trespass-offering: then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
\v 4 Then said they, What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden tumors, and
five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your
lords.
