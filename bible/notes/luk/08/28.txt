\v 28 And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, torment me not.
\v 29 For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and shackles; and breaking the bands asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts.
