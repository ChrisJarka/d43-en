Each year\add \f + \ft Or: Many times\add* \f* he came to it looking for figs, but there were no figs.
\v 7 Then he said to the gardener, 'Look \add here\add*! I have been looking for fruit on this fig tree every year for the past three years, but there have been no figs. Cut it down! It is just using up the nutrients in the soil for nothing!\f + \ft Or: Why should it continue using up the \add nutrients in\add* the soil \add for nothing\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*'
\v 8 But the man replied to the owner, 'Sir, leave it here for another year. I will dig around it and put manure around it.
\v 9 If it bears fruit next year, we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* will allow it to keep growing. If it does not bear fruit next year, you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* can cut it down.'"

\v 6 Then Jesus told them this story "A man planted a fig tree in his garden. Each year he came to pick the figs, but there were never any on it.
\v 7 Then he said to the gardener, 'Look at this tree! I have been looking for fruit on it every year for the past three years, but there have been no figs. Cut it down! It is just using up the nutrients in the soil for nothing!'
\v 8 But the gardener replied, 'Sir, leave it here for another year. I will dig around it and fertilize it.
\v 9 If it has figs on it next year, we can allow it to keep growing! If it does not bear any fruit by then, you can cut it down.'"

\v 6 And he told this parable, "Someone had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and looked for fruit on it but found none.
\v 7 And he said to the gardener, "Look, for three years I came and tried to find fruit on this fig tree and found none. Cut it down. Why let it waste the ground?
\v 8 But he answered and said, "Leave it alone this year while I dig around it and put manure on it.
\v 9 If it bears fruit next year, good; but if it does not, cut it down!
