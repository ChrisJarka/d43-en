\v 35 Jesus said to them, "I am the Bread that will make you live. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry. Whoever trusts in me will never be thirsty.
\v 36 Nevertheless, I have told you that, although you see me, you still do not trust me.

\v 35 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life, he who comes to me will not hunger, and he who believes in me will never thirst.
\v 36 However, I said to you that you have seen me, and you still do not believe.
\v 37 All whom the Father gives me will come to me, and he who comes to me I will absolutely not drive away.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I am the bread of life** - The "bread of life" is a metaphor for Jesus. Just as bread is necessary for our physical life, Jesus is necessary for our spiritual life. AT: "Just like food that keeps you alive physically, I can give you spiritual life that lasts forever." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **believes in** - This means to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, to trust him as Savior, and to live in a way that honors him.
  * **All whom the Father gives me will come to me** - God the Father and God the Son will save forever those who believe in Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **he who comes to me I will absolutely not drive away** - AT: "I will keep everyone who comes to me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
