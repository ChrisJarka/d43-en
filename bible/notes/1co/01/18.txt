\v 18 For those who are dying spiritually, the message of the cross is worthless. But for those of us whom God is rescuing from spiritual death, it is God's power working in us.
\v 19 A prophet wrote in scripture, 
\p The wisdom of those who think they are wise, 
I will destroy with complete devastation,
I will bring failure to the brilliant plans of the intelligent.

\v 18 For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing; but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
\v 19 For it is written,

\q and the understanding of the intelligent I will frustrate.
