====== Plural Pronouns ======


**Plural pronouns replace plural nouns â€” those that name more than one person, place, thing, or idea.** 


**//Dual Pronouns// ** 


Unlike some languages, English does not have //Dual Personal Pronouns//, which refer to two people only. If clarification is necessary, expressions like the following are used:


    * //1st Person Dual//: **us two/us both/both of us**  - these phrases can be [[:en:ta:vocabulary:exclusive|exclusive]] or [[:en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive|inclusive]] based on context
    * //1st Person Dual//: **you and I**  - this phrase is strictly [[:en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive|inclusive]]
    * //2nd Person Dual//: **you two/you both/both of you**
    * //3rd Person Dual//: **these two/those two** 
//**Plural Personal Pronouns**//:


English has two distinct //Plural Personal Pronouns//:


    * //1st Person Plural Pronoun//: **we/us**  - (from //Singular//: **I/me**) these words can be [[:en:ta:vocabulary:exclusive|exclusive]] or [[:en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive|inclusive ]]based on context
    * //3rd Person Plural Pronoun//: **they/them**  (from //Singular//: **he/him/she/her/it**)
In Standard English, **you **  can be either //Singular //  or //Plural//  based on context. For clarification, 'all' is used to form expressions like "you all" or "all of you" in specifying //2nd Person Plurality//.


//**Plural Demonstrative Pronouns:**  // 


    * **these **  (from //Singular//: **this**)
    * **those **  (from //Singular//: **that**)
//**Plural Indefinite Pronouns:**  // 


    * **everyone/everybody**  - (from //Singular//: **anyone/anybody**  or **someone/somebody**) - these words are usually [[:en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive|inclusive]]
**//Plural Relative Pronouns//**:


English's //Relative Pronouns//: **who/whom**, **whoever/whomever**,** that**, and **which**, do not change when they refer to //Plural //  entities.

"The __men who__  went to the store got lost."
