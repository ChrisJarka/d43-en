\v 1 At that time—this is Yahweh’s declaration—they will bring out the bones of the kings of Judah and its princes and the bones of the priests and the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves.
\v 2 Then they will spread them out in the sun and moon and all the host of the heavens that they have followed and that they have served, that they have walked after and sought, and that they have worshipped! They will not be gathered or buried. They will be like dung on the face of the earth.
\v 3 They will choose death instead of life for all their remaining remnant of this evil family in every remaining place where I have driven them.—this is Yahweh of Host’s declaration.
