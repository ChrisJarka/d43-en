===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The words "you," "they," "them," and "their" in these verses refer to Israel.

  * **strangers in the land** - It is implied that "the land" refers to Canaan. AT: "foreigners in the land of Canaan" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They went** - "They continued to wander" 
  * **from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another** - These two phrases have similar meanings and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **for their sakes** - "for their own well-being"
  * **Do not touch my anointed ones** - Here "touch" means to harm. It is an exaggeration Yahweh used to strengthen his warning to not harm his people. AT: "Do not harm the people I have anointed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
