\q2 \add I will punish the people of\add* Gaza \add city\add* because of the many sins that they have committed;

\v 6 This is what Yahweh says:
\q "For three sins of Gaza,
\q even for four,
\q I will not turn away punishment,
\q because they carried away captive a whole people,
\q to hand them over to Edom.
\q
\v 7 I will send fire on the walls of Gaza,
\q and it will devour her fortresses.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **For three sins of ... even for four** - This poetic device is not meant to imply that a specific number of sins had been committed, but to communicate that an abundance of sins had led to Godâ€™s judgment. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:01:03|1:3]].
  * **Gaza** - Here "Gaza" represents the people of the region of Gaza. AT: "the people of Gaza" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will not turn away punishment** - Yahweh uses two negatives here for emphasis. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:01:03|1:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **hand them over to** - "deliver them up to" or "sell them to"
  * **Edom** - Here "Edom" represents the people of the country of Edom. AT: "the people of Edom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **it will devour her fortresses** - Here Yahweh's judgment is spoken of as if it were a fire that was consuming the fortresses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
