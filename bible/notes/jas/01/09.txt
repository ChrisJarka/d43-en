\v 9 Believers who are poor should be glad because God has honored them.
\v 10 And believers who are rich should be glad that God has humbled them, which helps them trust in Jesus Christ, because they and their riches will pass away, just like wild flowers wither.
\v 11 When the sun rises, the scorching hot wind dries the plants and causes the flowers to fall and no longer be beautiful. Like the flower that dies, rich people will die while they are earning money.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Let the poor brother boast in his high position,
\v 10 but the rich brother in his low position, because he will pass away as a flower of the grass.
\v 11 For the sun rises with burning heat and dries up the grass. The flower falls off, and its beauty is lost. In the same way, the rich man will disappear while doing his activities.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the poor brother** - "the believer who does not have much money"
  * **glory in his high standing** - Someone whom God has honored is spoken of as if he were standing in a high place.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **but the rich brother** - "but the brother who has a lot of money"
  * **in his humility** - "should glory in his humility" is implied. AT: "should be happy that God has taught him humility." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **he will pass away as a wild flower in the grass** - Rich people are spoken of as being similar to wild flowers, which are alive for only a short time. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the rich man will fade away in the middle of his activities** - Here the flower simile is probably continued. As flowers do not die suddenly but instead fade away over a short time, so also the rich people may not die suddenly, but instead take a little time to disappear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **in the middle of his activities** - A rich man's actions in daily life are spoken of as if they were a place in which he was standing or sitting. This metaphor implies that he has given no thought to his coming death, and that it instead takes him by surprise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
