==== Description =====

There may be no note if the Unlocked Dynamic Bible provides a good alternate translation for the ULB. However, on occasion there may be text from the UDB as well as a suggested translation. There will be "(UDB)" after the text from the UDB.

==== Translation Notes Examples ====

> they implored him to stay with them (John 4:40 **ULB**)

> they urged him to stay a longer time with them (John 4:40 **UDB**)

  * **implored him**  - "begged him" or "urged him" (UDB)
Here the suggested translation for the words 'implored him' is 'begged him.' But the words, 'urged him', that mean the same in the UDB are included as another suggestion.
> When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face (Luke 5:12 **ULB**)

> When he saw Jesus, he bowed down to the ground (Luke 5:12 **UDB**)

  * **he fell on his face** - "he knelt and touched the ground with his face" or "he bowed down to the ground" (UDB)
Here the words from the UDB are provided as another translation suggestion.
