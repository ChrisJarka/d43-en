======How to use the Discussion Section======

This page explains when to create a new discussion and when to reply to another discussion. 


1) Create a new discussion  when you want to discuss a topic or issue that has not been brought up yet in the Discussion section.  You do this by writing in the edit pane at the bottom of the discussion section. When you have finished, click on the <Save> button at the bottom. This will put your Discussion at the top of the Discussion section and others will be able to read it.

2) When you want to comment on what someone else has written in the Discussion section, click on the <Reply> button below their discussion. An edit box will come up for you to write in. When you are done writing in it, click on the <Save> button. This will put your comment below the one you are replying to, and others will be able to read it. If other people have already replied to that person,  your comment will come below theirs. Your comment will be indented from the one you are replying to. 

Whenever you click <Save>, you will see the following four buttons under your comment:  <Reply>, <Edit>,  <Hide>, and <Delete>. Other people will only see <Reply>.
Only you can edit or delete your comment. Other people can only reply to it. The <Hide> button doesn’t seem to have any use. It seems to be like <Delete>.

If you want to edit or delete your comment, only do so if no one has replied to it. If others have replied to your message you can reply to your own message by clicking on the <Reply> button in your message or by clicking the  <Reply> button in someone else’s reply to your comment.

We call these discussions "threads." You can start a new thread by writing in the edit box at the bottom of the page, or you can continue a thread by clicking on a <Reply> button.
