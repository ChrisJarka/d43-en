===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to the rebuke of the wise** - The word "rebuke" can be expressed as a verb. AT: "when wise people rebuke you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **to listen to the song of fools** - "to listen to fools sing"
  * **like the crackling of thorns burning under a pot, so also is the laughter of fools** - This speaks of how listening to fools talk and laugh will teach you nothing, as if their speech and laughter were the sound of burning thorns. AT: "For listening to the laughter of fools will not teach a man any more than if he were listening to the crackling of thorns burning under a pot" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **vapor** - "mist." The authors speaks of things as being useless and meaningless as if they were 'vapor.' See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "as useless as vapor" or "meaningless" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
