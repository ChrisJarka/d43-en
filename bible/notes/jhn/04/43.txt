\v 43-44 Jesus had said \add previously\add* that people did not honor prophets \add like himself when they tried to teach people\add* in their own home area. So, two days later, Jesus and \add we\add* disciples left that area and went to \add his own area in\add* Galilee \add district, because he knew that people there would not think very highly of him, and as a result the Jewish leaders would not be jealous\add*.
\v 45 However, when we arrived in Galilee \add district, many\add* of the people there welcomed him, because they had been in Jerusalem during the \add Passover\add* celebration and had seen all the things he did there.

\v 43 After those two days in Samaria, he left and traveled to the region of Galilee.
\v 44 (Jesus himself spoke as a solemn oath the saying, 'a prophet receives honor in many places, but it is always true that a prophet never has honor in the place where he grew up.')
\v 45 However, when he arrived in Galilee, many of the people there welcomed him. They knew who he was because they saw all the things he had done in Jerusalem during the recent Passover celebration that was held there.
