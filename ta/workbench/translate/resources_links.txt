=== Repeated Phrases in a Book ===

Sometimes a phrase is used multiple times in a book. We can make it easier for the translators by reminding them of where they have already translated that phrase so they can translate it the same way. We only point them back to notes in the book they are working on.

  * **be fruitful and multiply**  - See how you translated these commands in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:28|1:28]]
  * **everything that creeps along the ground**  - This includes all types of small animals. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:24|1:25]].
  * **will be blessed in him**  - AT: "will be blessed because of Abraham" or "will be blessed because I have blessed Abraham." For translating "in him," see how you translated "through you" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:12:01|12:3]].
