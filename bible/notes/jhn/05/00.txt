====== John 05 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Porticos ==
Many of the Jews believed these porticos had healing properties. This happened when the waters were "stirred up." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== "The resurrection of judgment" ==
This is a reference to a time after [[:en:obe:kt:death|death]] when all of mankind will be [[:en:obe:kt:judge|judged]].

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Son, Son of God ==

Jesus refers to himself as "the Son," the "[[:en:obe:kt:sonofman|Son of Man]]" and the "[[:en:obe:kt:sonofgod|Son of God]]." Some languages may struggle having a person refer to himself in the third person.

== "He has testified concerning me" ==
Jesus speaks about the Old Testament testifies concerning himself. The Old Testament gives many [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophecies]] concerning the [[:en:obe:kt:christ|messiah]] which described Jesus before he came to earth.
