\c 15
\q
\v 1 A soft answer turns away wrath;
\q But a grievous word stirreth up anger.
\q
\v 2 The tongue of the wise utters knowledge aright;
\q But the mouth of fools pours out folly.
\q
\v 3 The eyes of Jehovah are in every place,
\q Keeping watch upon the evil and the good.
\q
\v 4 A gentle tongue is a tree of life;
\q But perverseness therein is a breaking of the spirit.
\q
\v 5 A fool despises his fatherâ€™s correction;
\q But he that regards reproof gets prudence.
\q
\v 6 In the house of the righteous is much treasure;
\q But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.
\q
\v 7 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge;
\q But the heart of the foolish does not so.
\q
\v 8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah;
\q But the prayer of the upright is his delight.
\q
\v 9 The way of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah;
\q But he loves him that follows after righteousness.
\q
\v 10 There is grievous correction for him that forsakes the way;
\q And he that hates reproof shall die.
\q
\v 11 Sheol and Abaddon are before Jehovah;
\q How much more then the hearts of the children of men!
\q
\v 12 A scoffer loves not to be reproved;
\q He will not go to the wise.
\q
\v 13 A glad heart makes a cheerful countenance;
\q But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.
\q
\v 14 The heart of him that has understanding seeks knowledge;
\q But the mouth of fools feedeth on folly.
\q
\v 15 All the days of the afflicted are evil;
\q But he that is of a cheerful heart has a continual feast.
\q
\v 16 Better is little, with the fear of Jehovah,
\q Than great treasure and trouble therewith.
\q
\v 17 Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is,
\q Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.
\q
\v 18 A wrathful man stirreth up contention;
\q But he that is slow to anger appeases strife.
\q
\v 19 The way of the sluggard is as a hedge of thorns;
\q But the path of the upright is made a highway.
\q
\v 20 A wise son makes a glad father;
\q But a foolish man despises his mother.
\q
\v 21 Folly is joy to him that is void of wisdom;
\q But a man of understanding makes straight his going.
\q
\v 22 Where there is no counsel, purposes are disappointed;
\q But in the multitude of counselors they are established.
\q
\v 23 A man has joy in the answer of his mouth;
\q And a word in due season, how good is it!
\q
\v 24 To the wise the way of life goes upward,
\q That he may depart from Sheol beneath.
\q
\v 25 Jehovah will root up the house of the proud;
\q But he will establish the border of the widow.
\q
\v 26 Evil devices are an abomination to Jehovah;
\q But pleasant words are pure.
\q
\v 27 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house;
\q But he that hates bribes shall live.
\q
\v 28 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer;
\q But the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.
\q
\v 29 Jehovah is far from the wicked;
\q But he hears the prayer of the righteous.
\q
\v 30 The light of the eyes rejoices the heart;
\q And good tidings make the bones fat.
\q
\v 31 The ear that heeds to the reproof of life
\q Shall abide among the wise.
\q
\v 32 He that refuseth correction despises his own soul;
\q But he that heeds to reproof gets understanding.
\q
\v 33 The fear of Jehovah is the instruction of wisdom;
\q And before honor goes humility.
