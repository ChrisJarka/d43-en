\v 19 My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I cannot hold my peace; because you
have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
\v 20 Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my tents destroyed,
and my curtains in a moment.
