===== Writing Styles - Quotations =====

===== Description =====

When telling what a person has said, what he said is put between inverted commas or quotation marks. ("_") Who said it and to whom was it said along with a verb of saying is called the quotation margin and is placed outside of the inverted commas or quotation marks. English allows the quote margin to be before, in the middle or at the end of the quotation. It also allows a large verity of verbs of saying. Most languages allow the quote margin to occur either only before, after or both before the quotation.\\
