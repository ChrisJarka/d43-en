====== Zechariah 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter starts out with a new date about two years later and is written in prose. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 7:4-14, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

This chapter's topic is different. The author has taken up a discussion about fasting. These people were asking the same questions as those from previous generations. The Israelites were asking these same questions before they were exiled from their land.
