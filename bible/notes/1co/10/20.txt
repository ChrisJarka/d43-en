\v 20 But I say, that the pagans sacrifice, they offer to demons and not to God. But I do not want you to have fellowship with demons.
\v 21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot share in the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
\v 22 Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he is?
