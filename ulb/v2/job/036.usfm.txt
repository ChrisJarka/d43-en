\v 1 Elihu also proceeded, and said,
\q
\v 2 Suffer me a little, and I will show thee;
\q For I have yet somewhat to say on Godâ€™s behalf.
\q
\v 3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
\q And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
\q
\v 4 For truly my words are not false:
\q One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
\q
\v 5 Behold, God is mighty, and despises not any:
\q He is mighty in strength of understanding.
\q
\v 6 He preserves not the life of the wicked,
\q But gives to the afflicted their right.
\q
\v 7 He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous:
\q But with kings upon the throne
\q He sets them for ever, and they are exalted.
\q
\v 8 And if they be bound in fetters,
\q And be taken in the cords of affliction;
\q
\v 9 Then he showeth them their work,
\q And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.
\q
\v 10 He opens also their ear to instruction,
\q And commands that they return from iniquity.
\q
\v 11 If they listen and serve him,
\q They shall spend their days in prosperity,
\q And their years in pleasures.
\q
\v 12 But if they listen not, they shall perish by the sword,
\q And they shall die without knowledge.
\q
\v 13 But they that are godless in heart lay up anger:
\q They cry not for help when he bindeth them.
\q
\v 14 They die in youth,
\q And their life perishes among the unclean.
\q
\v 15 He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,
\q And opens their ear in oppression.
\q
\v 16 Yea, he would have allured you out of distress
\q Into a broad place, where there is no straitness;
\q And that which is set on your table would be full of fatness.
\b
\q
\v 17 But you are full of the judgment of the wicked:
\q Judgment and justice take hold on thee.
\b
\q
\v 18 For let not wrath stir you up against chastisements;
\q Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.
\q
\v 19 Will your cry avail, that you be not in distress,
\q Or all the forces of your strength?
\q
\v 20 Desire not the night,
\q When peoples are cut off in their place.
\q
\v 21 Take heed, regard not iniquity:
\q For this have you chosen rather than affliction.
\q
\v 22 Behold, God does loftily in his power:
\q Who is a teacher like to him?
\q
\v 23 Who has enjoined him his way?
\q Or who can say, You have wrought unrighteousness?
\b
\q
\v 24 Remember that you magnify his work,
\q Whereof men have sung.
\b
\q
\v 25 All men have looked thereon;
\q Man sees it afar off.
\q
\v 26 Behold, God is great, and we know him not;
\q The number of his years is unsearchable.
\q
\v 27 For he draweth up the drops of water,
\q Which distil in rain from his vapor,
\q
\v 28 Which the skies pour down
\q And drop upon man abundantly.
\q
\v 29 Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,
\q The thunderings of his pavilion?
\q
\v 30 Behold, he spreadeth his light around him;
\q And he covers the bottom of the sea.
\q
\v 31 For by these he judges the peoples;
\q He gives food in abundance.
\q
\v 32 He covers his hands with the lightning,
\q And gives it a charge that it strike the mark.
\q
\v 33 The noise thereof tells concerning him,
\q The cattle also concerning the storm that comes up.
