\v 17 I will do that because they have abandoned me, and they burn incense to \add honor\add* other gods. They have caused me to become very angry by all the idols that they have made \f + \ft Or: by all the wicked things that they have done \f*, and my anger is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a fire that will not be put out."
\v 18 The king of Judah sent you to inquire what I, Yahweh, wanted you to do, this is what you should say to him: "Because you have heeded what was written in the scroll,
\v 19 and you repented and humbled yourself when you heard what I said to warn to \add about what would happen to\add* this city and the people who live here and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you. I said that I would cause this city to be abandoned. It will be a city whose name people will use when they curse someone. But I have heard what you prayed,

\v 17 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.
\v 18 But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall you say to him, Thus says Jehovah, the God of
Israel: As touching the words which you have heard,
\v 19 because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself before Jehovah, when you heard what I spoke against this
place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have tore your clothes, and
wept before me; I also have heard thee, says Jehovah.
