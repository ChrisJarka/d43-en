\v 5 While I was listening, he said to the other six men, "Follow the man wearing the white robe, and kill people. Do not pity them or act mercifully toward them.
\v 6 Slaughter old men, young men and women, older women and children, but do not harm any of those who have that mark on their forehead. Start at my temple." So they began by killing the elders who were \add worshiping idols\add* in front of the temple.

\v 5 Then he spoke to the others within my hearing, "Pass through the city after him and strike! Do not let your eyes have compassion,
and do not spare 
\v 6 either old man, young man, virgin, little children or women. Kill all of them! But do not approach any man who has the mark on his head.
Begin at my sanctuary!" So they began with the older men that were in front of the house.
