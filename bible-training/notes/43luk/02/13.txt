===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **a large number of**  - That is, "very many" or, "a large group of."
    * **heavenly army**- This refers to other angels from heaven who also serve God. If the word "army" would cause a negative impression, it may be better to translate this phrase as, "heavenly beings" or, "angels from heaven."
    * **Glory to God in the highest heaven**  - That is, "Let everyone in the highest heaven give glory to God."
    * **may there be peace on earth among people with whom he is pleased**  - That is, "may those on earth with whom God is pleased have peace. You may be able to translate this so that the part about glory to God in heaven has the same structure as the part about peace to people on earth.
    * **text**  - note
