===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They will say to you ** - "They" refers to the faithless ones. "you" refers to Yahweh's disciples. (See: Forms of 'you' - Dual/Plural)
  * **Consult with**  - "Talk with"
  * **those who chirp and mutter incantations **- "those who whisper and speak in a quiet voice about what we should do in the future"
  * **But should a people not consult their God? ****Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?**- God is scolding the people for looking to spirits to lead them instead of trusting Yahweh. This can be translated as "But people should ask Yahweh to guide them" They should not seek answers from the dead" (See: Rhetorical Question)
  * **If they do not say such things, it is because they have no light of dawn** - This compares the light of dawn breaking through the darkness with people who have faith in Yahweh. Those with faith have a hope that shines even in the darkest times. It can be translated as "If they do not speak of the law and the testimony, it is because they have no hope in Yahweh"
