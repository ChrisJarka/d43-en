\v 45 But do not think that I am the one who will accuse you while \add my\add* Father is listening! No, it is Moses who will accuse you! You thought that he would \add defend you\add*.
\v 46 Moses wrote about me, so if you had believed what he \add wrote\add*, you would have believed what I \add said\add*!
\v 47 But because you did not believe what he wrote \add about me\add*, you will certainly not believe what I say!\f + \ft Or: how will you believe what I say? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 45 But do not think that I am the one who will accuse you before my Father. You thought Moses would defend you and on him you had set your hope. But it is Moses who accuses and he condemns you.
\v 46 If you had accepted what Moses said, you would have received and trusted what I said!
\v 47 If you could not understand what Moses wrote, how then could you possibly trust what I am saying!"
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 45 Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you,
even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.
\v 46 For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me.
\v 47 But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?
