\v 36 Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, says the Lord Jehovah.
\v 37 And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;
\v 38 and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the
land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
