====== Ephrathite ======

===== Facts: =====

An Ephrathite was an inhabitant of Ephrath, which was an ancient name for the town of Bethlehem in Judah.

  * In the Old Testament, Naomi was an Ephrathite, as was Jesse the father of King David. Both were from the town of Bethlehem.
  * The Hebrew words for "Ephrath" and "Ephraim" are closely related and mean "fruitful". So sometimes "Ephrathite" is translated as "Ephraimite<font 14px line-height: 13.0666666030884px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>."</font>
