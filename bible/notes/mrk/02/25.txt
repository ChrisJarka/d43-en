\v 26 During the time Abiathar was high priest, David entered the big tent \add where people worshipped\add* God \add and asked for some bread. The high priest gave him some\add* of the loaves of bread. That bread was the bread he had presented to God. It was permitted in one of Moses' laws that only the priests could eat that bread! But David ate some of it. Then he also gave some of it to the men who were with him. \add But God did not consider that was wrong!\add*"
