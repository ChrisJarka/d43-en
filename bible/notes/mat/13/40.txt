\v 40 As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.
\v 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and
them that do iniquity,
\v 42 and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
\v 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears, let him hear.
