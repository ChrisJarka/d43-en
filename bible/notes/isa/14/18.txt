<usfm>
\v 18 All the kings of the nations, all of them, sleep in glory, every one in his own tomb.
\v 19 But you are cast out of your grave like an  branch thrown away, from among  the slain. You will be like those pierced
 with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit,  as a dead body trampled under foot.
\v 20 You will never join with them in burial, because you have destroyed your land. You ,who have slain your people, are the son
of evil-doers and will never be mentioned again.
