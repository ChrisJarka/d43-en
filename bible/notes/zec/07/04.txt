\v 4 Then the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels gave me a message.
\v 5 He said, "Tell \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the priests and all the other people of Judah that during the past 70 years, when they mourned and fasted during the fifth and seventh months \add of each year\add*, it was not really \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* me, Yahweh, whom they were \add honoring\add*.
\v 6 And when they ate and drank, it was really \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* to \add benefit\add* themselves.
\v 7 That is certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what I continually told the former prophets to proclaim \add to the people\add*, when Jerusalem and the nearby towns were prosperous and filled with people, and people also lived in the desert area to the south and in the foothills to the west."

\v 4 Then came the word of Jehovah of hosts to me, saying,
\v 5 Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the
seventh month, even these seventy youars, did you at all fast to me, even to me?
\v 6 And when you eat, and when you drink, do not you eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?
\v 7 Should you not hear the words which Jehovah cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited
and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?
