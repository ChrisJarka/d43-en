\c 8
\p
\v 1 Now in the things which we are saying the chief point is
this: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
\v 2 a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
\v 3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this
high priest also have somewhat to offer.
\v 4 Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;
\v 5 who serve that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned
of God when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, says he, that you make all things according to the
pattern that was showed you in the mount.
\v 6 But now has he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which
has been enacted upon better promises.
\v 7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second.
\v 8 For finding fault with them, he saith,
\q Behold, the days come, says the Lord,
\q That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
\q
\v 9 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
\q In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt;
\q For they continued not in my covenant,
\q And I regarded them not, says the Lord.
\q
\v 10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
\q After those days, says the Lord;
\q I will put my laws into their mind,
\q And on their heart also will I write them:
\q And I will be to them a God,
\q And they shall be to me a people:
\q
\v 11 And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen,
\q And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord:
\q For all shall know me,
\q From the least to the greatest of them.
\q
\v 12 For I will be merciful to their iniquities,
\q And their sins will I remember no more.
\p
\v 13 In that he saith, A new covenant, he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxes aged is
near to vanishing away.
