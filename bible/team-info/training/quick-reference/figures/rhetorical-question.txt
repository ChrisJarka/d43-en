=== Gen:21:07 ===

"She also said, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children, and yet I have borne him a son in his old age!"

  * **Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children**  - This rhetorical question emphasizes how unlikely it was for Sarah to have children. It can also be translated as a statement: "No one would have ever said to Abraham, 'Sarah will nurse children.'" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
=== Jon:01:06 ===

"So the captain came to him and said to him, 'What are you doing, sleeping? Get up! Call upon your god! Maybe your god will notice us and we will not perish.'"

  * **What are you doing, sleeping?**  - the captain used this rhetorical question to scold Jonah. "Stop sleeping!" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
=== Act:14:15 ===

"But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothing and quickly went out into the crowd, crying out and saying, "Men, why are you doing these things? We also are human beings with the same feelings as you."

  * **Men, why are you doing these things?**  - Paul and Barnabas are rebuking the people for trying to sacrifice to them. This can be stated as, "Men, you must not do these things!" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
