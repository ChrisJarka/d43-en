\v 14 One reason that he went there was so that these words that were written by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
\p
\v 15 Zebulun region and Naphtali region are on the road which is near Galilee Lake and on the eastern side of the Jordan River. They are the regions in Galilee District where many non-Jews are living.
\v 16 Although the people there will be like people who sit in a dark place, they will suddenly
perceive clearly a new teaching, as people who have seen a big light shining on them perceive everything clearly. The people who are located in a dangerous region will suddenly perceive clearly what God teaches, as people on whom a light shines perceive things clearly.

\v 14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\q
\v 15 The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
\q Toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,
\q Galilee of the Gentiles!
\q
\v 16 The people that sat in darkness
\q Saw a great light,
\q And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death,
\q To them did light spring up.
