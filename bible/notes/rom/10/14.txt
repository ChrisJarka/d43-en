\v 14  \add In regard to the people of Israel rejecting the gospel, some people might object by saying\add*, \f + \ft Or: \add This raises another problem about the Jews\add*: \f* "They certainly cannot ask  \add Christ\add* \add to help\f + \ft Or: save them\add* if they have not  \add first\add* believed  \add in him\add*!\f + \ft Or: How \f* can they ask  \add Christ to help, Or: save them\add* if they have not  \add first\add* believed  \add in him\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* And they certainly cannot believe  \add in him\add* if they have not heard about him!\f + \ft Or: how can they believe  \add in him\add* if they have not heard about him? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* And they certainly cannot hear  \add about him\add* if someone does not preach to them  \add about him\add*!\f + \ft Or: how can they hear  \add about him\add* if someone does not preach to them  \add about him\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 14 Most of the Jews have certainly not believed in Christ, and some people might try to explain why they have not done so. They might say, “The Jews certainly cannot ask Christ to help them if they have not first believed in him! And they certainly cannot believe in him if they have not heard about him! And they certainly cannot hear about him if someone does not preach to them about him!
\v 15 And those who could preach to them about Christ, certainly cannot do so if God does not send them. But if some believers preached to them, it would be just like the Scriptures say: ‘It is wonderful when people come and bring good news!'"

\v 14 How then can they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how can they believe in him whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without a preacher?
\v 15 And how can they preach, unless they are sent?—As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim glad tidings of good things!"
