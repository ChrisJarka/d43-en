====== Acts 28:28 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28-29 \add That is what God said to the prophet Isaiah about our ancestors. But you Jews today do not want to believe God's message\add*. Therefore, I am telling you that \add God\add* has sent to the non-Jews this message about how he saves people, and they will listen \add and accept it\add*!"
\p
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Therefore, you should know that God is offering to save the non-Jews, and they will listen."
\v 29 \f + \ft Acts 28:29 - the oldest and most accurate Greek manuscripts of the book of Acts do not include the additional words found in Acts 28:29; and for that reason they are not included here. \f*

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Therefore, you should know that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen."
\v 29 \f + \ft Acts 28:29 - the best ancient copies omit vs. 29, \fqa When he had said these things, the Jews went away. They were having a great dispute among themselves. \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul finishes speaking to the Jewish leaders in Rome.

  * **they will listen** - "some of them will listen"
  * **When he had said these things, the Jews went away. They were having a great dispute among themselves** - This is v. 29, but it is very doubtful that this verse is original to the Book of Acts. However, some older versions have it. If translators include it, they should put it in square brackets. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_textvariants]])
