====== Leviticus 22:14-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 If anyone who is not permitted to eat a sacred offering eats it without realizing that it is sacred, he must pay the priest for the offering, and pay him an extra one-fifth of its value.
\v 15 When the priests bring offerings to me, the sacred offerings that the Israelite people bring to them, they must not treat those offerings as though they are not sacred
\v 16 by allowing those who are not priests to eat any of those offerings. If they did that, they would become guilty and must make a payment. I am Yahweh, the one who causes those offerings to be sacred."

\v 14 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof to it, and shall give to the priest the holy thing.
\v 15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer to Jehovah,
\v 16 and so cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.
