\v 8 For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.
\v 9 There remains therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.
\v 10 For he that is entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.
\v 11 Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience.
