\v 18 Then Elisha said, "Pick up the other arrows and strike the ground with them!" So the king picked up the arrows and struck the ground three times.
\v 19 But Elisha was angry with him. He exclaimed, "You should have struck the ground five or six times!

But now, \add because you struck the ground only three times\add*, your army will defeat them only three times!"

\v 17 And he said, Open the window eastward; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot; and he shot. And he said, Jehovahâ€™s
arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for you shall strike the Syrians in Aphek, till you have consumed
them.
\v 18 And he said, Take the arrows; and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Strike upon the ground; and he struck
thrice, and stayed.
\v 19 And the man of God was angry with him, and said, You should have struck five or six times: then had you struck
Syria till you had consumed it; whereas now you shall strike Syria but thrice.
