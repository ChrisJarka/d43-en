<usfm>
\v 37 And that which you sow is not the body that it will be, but only a bare grain. It may become wheat, or some other kind;
\v 38 But God gives it a body as it pleases him, and to each seed a body of its own.
\v 39 All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.
