====== Introduction to Galatians ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of Galatians ===

  - Paul declares his authority as an apostle of Jesus Christ; he expresses his astonishment at the errors of the Galatian church (1:1–10)
  - Salvation is by Christ alone and not by keeping the law (1:11–2:21)
  - Justification is only by faith in Christ; the example of Abraham; the curse which the law brings (and not a means of salvation); slavery and freedom compared and illustrated by Hagar and Sarah (3:1–4:31)
  - Freedom in Christ; freedom from the law; freedom in the Spirit, and not a slavery to the law; living by the Spirit, and not by the sinful nature (the flesh); do good to all, bear each other’s burdens (5:1–6:10)
  - Warning about circumcision and keeping the law, and putting the focus on the Cross of Christ (6:11–18)

=== What is the Book of Galatians about? ===

Paul wrote to address the Christians, both Jewish and non-Jewish, in the churches in Galatia.  He wrote specifically to confront a false teaching that said Christians needed to follow the Jewish laws from the Old Testament, especially circumcision.  There were a group of people among the Christians called Judaizers who were requiring non-Jewish Christians to be circumcised.  They also called Paul’s apostolic authority into question.  Paul defended his apostleship by telling some of his story (1:11-2:14) and he defended the gospel by explaining that salvation can only be obtained by faith in Jesus Christ (2:16).  It is a result of the kindness God shows and not what people do. 

=== Who wrote the Book of Galatians? ===

The book of Galatians was written by the Apostle Paul (1:1).  It was a letter that Paul wrote to churches of the Galatians sometime between 48-57 years after the birth of Christ.  The Galatians were probably the people living in the Roman province of Galatia.  Scholars are not sure where Paul was when he wrote the letter, but the cities of Ephesus and Corinth are two possible locations.
