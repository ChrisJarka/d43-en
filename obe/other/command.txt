====== command, to command, commandment ======

===== Definition: =====

The terms "command" and "commandment" refer to ordering someone to do something.

  * Although these terms have basically the same meaning, "commandment" often refers to certain commands of God which are more formal and permanent, such as the Ten Commandments. 
  * Sometimes a command tells people what they should do, such as "Honor your parents."
  * Other times a command tells people what they should not do, such as, "Do not steal."
  * It is best to translate this term __differently__ from the term, "law." Also compare with the definitions of "decree" and "statute."
  * Some languages may prefer to translate "command" and "commandment" with the same word.
