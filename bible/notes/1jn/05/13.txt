\v 13 I have written this letter to you who believe that Jesus is the Son of God, in order that you may know that you will live forever.
\v 14 Because we are joined with him, we are very confident that he hears us when we ask him to do anything he approves of.
\v 15  And since we know that he hears us whenever we ask him for something, we also know that he will do what we ask him for.

\v 13 These things I have written to you that you may know that you have eternal life—to you who believe in the name of the Son of God.
\v 14 And this is the confidence we have before him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
\v 15 And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask of him—we know that we have whatever we asked of him.
