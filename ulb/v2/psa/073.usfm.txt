\d A Psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 Surely God is good to Israel,
\q Even to such as are pure in heart.
\q
\v 2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone;
\q My steps had well near slipped.
\q
\v 3 For I was envious at the arrogant,
\q When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
\q
\v 4 For there are no pangs in their death;
\q But their strength is firm.
\q
\v 5 They are not in trouble as other men;
\q Neither are they plagued like other men.
\q
\v 6 Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck;
\q Violence covers them as a garment.
\q
\v 7 Their eyes stand out with fatness:
\q They have more than heart could wish.
\q
\v 8 They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression:
\q They speak loftily.
\q
\v 9 They have set their mouth in the heavens,
\q And their tongue walks through the earth.
\q
\v 10 Therefore his people return hither:
\q And waters of a full cup are drained by them.
\q
\v 11 And they say, How does God know?
\q And is there knowledge in the Most High?
\q
\v 12 Behold, these are the wicked;
\q And, being always at ease, they increase in riches.
\q
\v 13 Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart,
\q And washed my hands in innocency;
\q
\v 14 For all the day long have I been plagued,
\q And chastened every morning.
\q
\v 15 If I had said, I will speak thus;
\q Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of your children.
\q
\v 16 When I thought how I might know this,
\q It was too painful for me;
\q
\v 17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God,
\q And considered their latter end.
\q
\v 18 Surely you set them in slippery places:
\q You throw them down to destruction.
\q
\v 19 How are they become a desolation in a moment!
\q They are utterly consumed with terrors.
\q
\v 20 As a dream when one awaketh,
\q So, O Lord, when you awakest, you will despise their image.
\q
\v 21 For my soul was grieved,
\q And I was pricked in my heart:
\q
\v 22 So brutish was I, and ignorant;
\q I was as a beast before thee.
\q
\v 23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee:
\q You have holden my right hand.
\q
\v 24 You will guide me with your counsel,
\q And afterward receive me to glory.
\q
\v 25 Whom have I in heaven but thee?
\q And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.
\q
\v 26 My flesh and my heart faileth;
\q But God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.
\q
\v 27 For, lo, they that are far from you shall perish:
\q You have destroyed all them that play the harlot, departing
from thee.
\q
\v 28 But it is good for me to draw near to God:
\q I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge,
\q That I may tell of all your works.
