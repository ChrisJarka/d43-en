===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Instead of sweet perfume there will be stench; and instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-coiffed hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a covering of sackcloth; and branding instead of beautyâ€‹** - These show contrasts between what the women see as beautiful and what Yahweh sees as ugly sin.  The women thought that all these adornments would make them beautiful, but Yahweh will punish them by replacing their evil ways with something that is as ugly as their soul. 
  * **sackcloth** - Sackcloth was a dark garment made out of goat or camel hair that was worn as a sign of mourning, grief or humiliation. This cloth was very coarse and scratchy.
  * **Jerusalem's gates will lament and mourn** - The important people met in the gates to talk and make business deals. When Yahweh judges the people, the leaders, here represented by Jerusalem's gates, will cry and mourn for the way they used to live. (See: [[en:ta:translate:personification]])
  * **she** - This pronoun refers to Jerusalem.
  * **she will be alone and sit upon the ground** - A woman is used to represent Jerusalem. This can be translated "Jerusalem will be desolate."
