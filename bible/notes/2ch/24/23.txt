\v 23 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and
Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king of
Damascus.
\v 24 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Jehovah delivered a very great host into their hand,
because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment upon Joash.
