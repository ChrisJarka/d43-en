===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer of Lamentations uses many different ways to express the people of Israel losing his favor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion with a dark cloud** - The Lord covers Jerusalem with a cloud as a person might cover something ugly they don’t want to look at. 
  * **Daughter of Zion...Daughter of Judah...the beauty of Israel** - The city of Jerusalem is referred to in different ways in this passage.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **cast down the beauty of Israel from heaven to the earth** - The phrase “beauty of Israel” refers to Jerusalem.  Jerusalem being thrown from heaven to earth refers to Jerusalem losing favor with God. Being lower is considered to be like being less favored.
  * **ignored his footstool** - The word “footstool” refers to the Ark of the Covenant in Jerusalem.  This is an honored place where God allowed his Spirit to rest among the people of Israel.  This phrase refers to God not being among the people of Israel as ignoring the place he enjoys resting.
  * **day of his anger** - This phrase refers to when God punishes Israel because of his anger.  The word “day” is used generally and doesn’t mean God punished Israel for only one day. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **swallowed up** - This phrase refers to Israel being destroyed and being taken from Israel like food that is swallowed and is gone. 
  * **thrown down the fortified cities...struck them down to the ground**  - These phrases refer to the walls of the cities falling down.  It is like Yahweh threw them down or knocked them down because he sent an army to destroy them.
