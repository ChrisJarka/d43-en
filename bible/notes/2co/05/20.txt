\v 20 So, it is I and my companions who are Christ's representatives \add in this world. When we tell people the message about Christ\add*, it is God himself who is pleading with them by means of what we \add say\add*. So, as true representatives of Christ, we plead with you: \add Believe God's true message about Christ in order that you may\add* be reconciled to \f + \ft Or:have a peaceful relationship with \f* him.
\v 21 \add You must believe that even though\add* Jesus never sinned, God \add punished him for all the\add* sinful things \add that people do, just\add* as \add if Jesus had done those sinful things himself\add*. And because of our close relationship with Christ, God has erased the record of our sins\f + \ft Or: declared \f* us no longer guilty for our sins.

\v 20 So, we are Christ's representatives. It is God himself who pleads with you by what we say. This is what we plead and say to you, because Christ has done this for you: By Christ, be reconciled to God.
\v 21 God made Christ a sacrifice for sin—the one who never sinned—so that when we trust in Christ and believe in him, God made us as holy before God as Christ is.
