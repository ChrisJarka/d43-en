\v 2 Yahweh said to me, "I want you to accuse Israel, who is like a mother to you, of being like an unfaithful wife to me.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking to Hosea.

  * **lawsuit**  - a complaint by one person against another in a court of law
  * **your mother **- Here this refers to Israel.
  * **for she is not my wife, and neither am I her husband **- Yahweh is stating that Israel (she) is no longer acting like a wife to Yahweh. Instead Israel has turned away from following and worshiping Yahweh. Because of that, Yahweh can no longer be in relationship to the nation of Israel as a husband would be to his wife. (see: metaphor)
  * **and her acts of adultery from between her breasts **- //and her acts of adultery from between her breasts //  can be made explicit: "She must stop acting like a woman who leaves her husband and goes to other men." (UDB) (see: Explicit and implicit information)
  * **I will strip her naked and show her nakedness as on the day that she was born**  - This can mean both the literal and the figurative. In other places in the Old Testament, women who were found committing adultery were literally stripped of their clothing to expose them. The figurative meaning in this passage is that because Israel has turned away from Yahweh, they will no longer have Yahweh's protection around them and his provision for them. (see: Parallelism and Metonymy)
  * **and I will make her die from thirst **- Israel must be able to find water in the wilderness or they will die.  Figuratively, "thirst" refers to the need to worship and rely on Yahweh (not idols), or Israel will not be able to survive as a nation. (see: Idiom and Synecdoche)
