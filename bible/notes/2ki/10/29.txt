\v 29 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them,
to wit, the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.
\v 30 And Jehovah said to Jehu, Because you have done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes,
and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall
sit on the throne of Israel.
\v 31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Jehovah, the God of Israel, with all his heart: he departed not from the sins
of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
