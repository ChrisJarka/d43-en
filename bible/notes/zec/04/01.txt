\v 1 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.
\v 2 And he said to me, What see thou? And I said, I have seen, and, behold, a candlestick all of gold, with its bowl upon
the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top thereof;
\v 3 and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.
