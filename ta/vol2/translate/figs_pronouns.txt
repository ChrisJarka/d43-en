===== Pronouns - Singular =====

//This page answers the question:// //What are English singular pronouns?//

//In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read://
  * //[[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech|Parts of Speech]]//

Singular pronouns replace singular nouns, which are those that name one person, place, thing, or idea.
 
==== Singular Personal Pronouns: ====
 
Personal Pronouns refer to people.
  * //1st Person Singular Personal Pronoun//: **I**  or **me**  - refers to the //Speaker//
  * //2nd Person Singular Personal Pronoun//: **you**  - refers to the //Addressee//
In Standard English, **you**  is also used to refer to many different people. Therefore, the exclusive (see [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]]) or inclusive (see [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]]) of **you **  is based on context.
 
English has two gender-specific //3rd Person Singular Pronouns// that depend on the sex of the individual referenced.
  * //3rd Person Singular Personal Masculine Pronoun: //**he **- refers to a male person
  * //3rd Person Singular Personal Feminine Pronoun: //**she **- refers to a female person 
 
English has one gender-neutral //3rd Person Singular Pronoun//, however, it can only refer to non-human things.
  * //3rd Person Singular Non-human Pronoun//: **it** - refers to a singular thing
 
Often the word "they" is used in place of a singular pronoun such as "he or she" when the sex of the person is not important. For example: "If __a student__  wants to get a good grade on the test, then __they__  must study hard."
