===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **bold words**  - explanation
    * **Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head** - The purpose of this is to use polite terms for an unpleasant meaning: “Within three days Pharaoh will remove your head (from you).” This is a figure of Speech (see: [[en:ta:translate:euphemism|Euphamism]]). This is also an identical statement with a very different meaning from verse 13, the interpretation for the butler or wine steward. The Baker will be dead; The Wine Steward will be alive and restored. It is designed to dramatically emphasize the contrasting outcomes. This is a **Play on Words.**
