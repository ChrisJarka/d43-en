  - go to File → Export.  
  - Name your file.
  - In the "Save as type" drop-down menu, select either WAV or MP3.
  - Click the Options button if you are saving as MP3. Choose these settings:
    * Bit Rate Mode: Constant
    * Quality: 128 kbps
    * Variable Speed: N/A
    * Channel Mode: Joint Stereo
