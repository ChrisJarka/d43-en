\c 21
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 The king shall joy in your strength, O Jehovah;
\q And in your salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
\q
\v 2 You have given him his heartâ€™s desire,
\q And have not withholden the request of his lips. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 3 For you meet him with the blessings of goodness:
\q You set a crown of fine gold on his head.
\q
\v 4 He asked life of thee, you gave it him,
\q Even length of days for ever and ever.
\q
\v 5 His glory is great in your salvation:
\q Honor and majesty do you lay upon him.
\q
\v 6 For you make him most blessed for ever:
\q You make him glad with joy in your presence.
\q
\v 7 For the king trusts in Jehovah;
\q And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.
\q
\v 8 Your hand will find out all your enemies;
\q Your right hand will find out those that hate thee.
\q
\v 9 You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger:
\q Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath,
\q And the fire shall devour them.
\q
\v 10 Their fruit will you destroy from the earth,
\q And their seed from among the children of men.
\q
\v 11 For they intended evil against thee;
\q They conceived a device which they are not able to perform.
\q
\v 12 For you will make them turn their back;
\q You will make ready with your bowstrings against their face.
\q
\v 13 Be you exalted, O Jehovah, in your strength:
\q So will we sing and praise your power.
