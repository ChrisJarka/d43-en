\v 30 Now a herd of many pigs was there feeding, not too far away from them.
\v 31 The demons kept imploring Jesus and saying, "If you cast us out, send us away into that herd of pigs."
\v 32 Jesus said to them, "Go!" The demons came out and went into the pigs. And behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep hill into the sea and they died in the water.
