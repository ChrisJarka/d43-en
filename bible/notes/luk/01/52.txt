===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He has thrown down princes from their thrones** - A throne is a chair that a king sits on, and it is a symbol of his authority. If a king is brought down from his throne, it means he no longer has the authority to reign as king.  AT: "He has taken away the authority of kings" or "He has made rulers stop ruling." 
  * **has raised up those of low condition** - In this word picture, people who are important are higher than people who are less important. AT: "has made humble people important" or "has given honor to people whom others have not honored." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **filled the hungry with good things** - AT: "given good food to the hungry"
