=== What is the Book of James about? ===

The book of James is one of the “General Epistles.”  These General Epistles are not addressed to a specific church or individual(s), but are addressed broadly to the whole church. This letter was written just prior to the Jerusalem Council and has a largely Jewish Christian audience. James is a topical letter, and quickly shifts from one topic to another. There are strong pleas and warnings  with many figures of speech taken from nature. The treatment of the poor by the rich in the church is a major concern of this letter. Many parts of this letter correspond to portions of the Sermon on the Mount. 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "James." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "A Letter from James" or "The letter James wrote." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of James? ===

The book of James was written by someone called James.  This was probably James the half-brother of Jesus, who was a leader in the early church and was part of the Jerusalem council.  The Apostle Paul also called him a 'pillar' of the church.  

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Does James contradict Paul? ===

Paul teaches in Romans that christians are [[:en:obe:kt:justify|justified]] by [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]] and not by [[:en:obe:kt:work|works]], while James teaches that christians are justified by works. There is no contradiction. One possible solution to this issue involves understanding that the word "justification" is used in two different way. Paul teaches that christians are declare righteous in reference to God while James teaches that man is declared to be righteous by according to man by his actions. Another difficulty involves whether faith without works is "dead" or "useless." These word choices can have significant theological implications.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Where do you put the quotation marks in James 2? ===

There is some controversy regarding where to place the quotation marks in James 2:18. The ULB states "Yet someone will say, 'You have faith, and I have works.' Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works." It is also possible, to translate as "Yet someone will say, 'You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works.'" The length of this hypothetical statement can have significant theological implications. 

=== How to transition between topics? ===

The letter quickly shifts from one topic to another. The transitions are rarely smooth. It is acceptable to allow the verse to appear disconnected from each other. It may make sense to set the passages apart by starting a new line or putting a space between topics.
