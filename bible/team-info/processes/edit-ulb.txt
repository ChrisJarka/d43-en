====== Edit the ULB ======


=== Purpose of the ULB ===


The ULB (UnfoldingWord Literal Bible) is a "literal" version that is intended as a source text for translation of the Bible that will not only convey the meaning of the original language very closely, but will try to reflect the form of the original text as much as possible without causing problems in comprehension.


The ULB is not a "finished translation." Rather, its purpose is to serve as a source language for other translations. Therefore, it is more important that it convey the meaning of the Bible text than it is to be "polished." However, the ULB should still be easy to read–even for people whose first language is not English.


=== Source of the ULB ===


The ULB is an adaptation of the 1901 ASV. The ASV is a very literal translation, and it has an abundance of archaic terminology. We are removing as much of this terminology as we can by automatic scripting on the server. But many unclear words and phrases remain. They need to be updated so as to be understandable to a modern audience.


=== Style of the ULB ===


The ULB is intended to be accompanied by the translation notes and key-term explanations. Furthermore, the ULB will be accompanied by the UDB, which will provide alternative "dynamic" translation suggestions. Therefore, it is acceptable for the ULB to retain much of the ASV's literalism, including the structure, word order, and terminology of the original languages, as long as they are not overly difficult to understand.


=== Editing the ULB ===


The lead editor of the ULB will:


    * Remove the section headings (/s) and titles (/sr).
    * Remove all footnotes.
    * Divide the text into small, manageable chunks of 1-4 verses using a space and (/s5).
    * Verify that the chunks match the division of the UDB.


The edit team members will:


    * Check that the English level is easy to understand.
    * Remove archaic language and replace with modern, clear English.
    * Divide the text into shorter sentences where possible.
    * Retain the literal nature of the text–it should compliment the "dynamic" UDB rather than be similar to it.


Specific editing guidelines:


    * Only use quotation marks at the beginning and ending of direct speech. Do not put quotation marks at the beginning of each verse, even though the speech may span several verses.
    * All pronouns are lower case (except when beginning sentences).
    * Try to find other ways to translate the Greek participle. Many languages do not have participles.


Translation Choices:


    * Use "It happened" rather than "It came to pass."
    * For "lawyers" use "experts in the Jewish law." Keep "scribes."
