\v 30 It is because of what God \add has done\add* that you have a close relationship with\f + \ft Or: belong to \f* Christ Jesus.

\v 31 So, it is \bd the Lord\bd* whom we should boast about, \add not about one spiritual leader being better than another\add*. We should do as \add a prophet\f + \ft Or: Jeremiah\add* \f* wrote \add in the Scriptures that we should do\add*:
\q Those who boast should boast \add only\add* about what the Lord \add has done\add*.

\v 30 Because of what God has done to save you, you are now joined to Christ Jesus. It is through Christ that God has made us wise; it is through Christ that God has made us right with himself; it is through Christ that God has set us apart for himself, and it is through Christ that God has rescued us.
\v 31 So, as the Scriptures say: 
\q "The one who is proud should be proud only of who the Lord is and of what the Lord has done."
