===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **"Skin for skin, indeed;**  -  This is a figure of speech which people would have understood. The next sentence parallels it andhelps the reader understand it. "Skin" is a metonym for Job's life. An alternate translation is: “A person will do anything to save his own life, even accept the loss of possessions and loved ones.” (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]], and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **put forth your hand**  - See how you translated this in 01:11. God stretching forth his hand causes something to happen. An alternate translation is, "reach out and remove his health." See also the meaning, " “by the hand of the Lord” listed above under the Important Term: [[:en:obe:other:hand]]. (see also: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **renounce you to your face.”**  - See how you translated this in 01:11. “he will reject you.”
    * **“See, he is in your hand;**  - This has a different meaning than the term "hand" above. It means, "Look, I have given him over to your control." Also listed above under the Important Term: [[:en:obe:other:hand]].
    * **bold words**  - explanation
