====== 2 Kings 12:15-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 The men who supervised the work always did things honestly, so the king's secretary and the Supreme Priest never required that the supervisors report what they had spent the money for.
\v 16 But the money that people gave to pay for the wrong things that they had done and the money they gave to purify themselves because of the sins that they had committed was not put in the chest. That money belonged to the priests.

\v 15 Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work; for
they dealt faithfully.
\v 16 The money for the trespass-offerings, and the money for the sin-offerings, was not brought into the house of Jehovah: it
was the priestsâ€™.
