\v 10 This will happen to Moab and Ammon because of their pride, since they taunted and encroached upon the people of Yahweh of Hosts!  [[I filled in the Moab and Ammon to clarify who this is happening to]]
\v 11 They will then fear Yahweh, for he will taunt all the gods of the earth and every man will worship him, every one
from his own place, from every national coast!   [[I'm inclined to think that the 'coasts' here are emblematic of boundaries and therefore this is "from the borders of every nation". Thoughts?]]
