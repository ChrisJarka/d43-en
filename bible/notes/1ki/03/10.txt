\v 10 The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
\v 11 God said to him, "Because you have asked this thing and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice,
\v 12 I have done according to your word. I have given you a wise and an understanding heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor after you will any arise like to you.
