===== Offline Distribution and Listening =====

This module answers the question: //How is content distributed and listened to offline?//

There are many ways to share and distribute audio resources in a local setting. Our focus is specifically on offline distribution and listening because the vast majority of people in the world:
    * do not have internet access,
    * cannot afford mobile data costs for content downloads or listening over data connection,
    * are not skilled at navigating websites to find audio resources and
    * have many other reasons why accessing online content is not practical or possible.

The most effective way to meet the needs of those interested to hear audio resources is to provide offline access suited to the listening platform and setting that works best for them.

For many years devices have been designed for the ability to play digital audio. These may be in the form of a versatile radio with ports for digital data, generic MP3 players or as audio players specifically designed for optimized delivery of Biblical content for the end-user. Some of these even have tamper proof memory which ensures that it is used for years to convey Biblical content, not re-programmed for other purposes.

Below we will briefly discuss a variety of options.
