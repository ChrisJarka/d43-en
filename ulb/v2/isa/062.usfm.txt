\c 62
\p
\v 1 For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as
brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burneth.
\v 2 And the nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory, and you shall be called by a new name, which the
mouth of Jehovah shall name.
\v 3 You shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
\v 4 You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called
Hephzi-bah, and your land Beulah; for Jehovah delights in thee, and your land shall be married.
\v 5 For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall your sons marry thee; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so
shall your God rejoice over thee.
\p
\v 6 I have set watchmen upon your walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: you that are Jehovah’s
remembrancers, take you no rest,
\v 7 and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
\v 8 Jehovah has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for
your enemies; and foreigners shall not drink your new wine, for which you have labored:
\v 9 but they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the
courts of my sanctuary.
\p
\v 10 Go through, go through the gates; prepare you the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones;
lift up an ensign for the peoples.
\v 11 Behold, Jehovah has proclaimed to the end of the earth, Say you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation cometh;
behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
\v 12 And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of Jehovah: and you shall be called Sought out, A city not
forsaken.
