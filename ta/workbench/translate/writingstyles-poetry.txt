=== Translation Principles (optional) ===
===== Examples from the Bible =====

The Bible uses poetry for songs, teaching and prophecy. Almost all of the books of the Old Testament have poetry in them and many of the books are completely poetry. 
  - Hebrew poetry usually has parallel lines (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]). Example: For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant planting; (Isiah 5:7a 
  - It has lots of figures of speech particularly metaphors, (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]. Example: When your eyes light upon the money, it is gone, and suddenly it takes up wings and flies off to the sky like an eagle. (proverbs 23:5)
  - similes Example: I will make her like the wilderness, like a parched land, (Hosea 2:3b)  (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  - metonymys) Example: All this is because of the rebellion of Jacob, and because of the sins of the house of Israel. What was the reason for Jacob's rebellion? Was it not Samaria? (Micah 1:5a) See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  - Repetition of some or all of a line. Example: Oh, give thanks to Yahweh; for he is good, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever. Oh, give thanks to the God of gods, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever. Oh, give thanks to the Lord of lords, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever. (Psalm 136:1-3)
