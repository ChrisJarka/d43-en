====== Identify the Speaker ======

===== Description =====

In many cases it may be difficult to tell when the speaker in a passage changes. For example, in prophesy it may be unclear whether God or the prophet are speaking in a particular passage. 

===== Standard Notes =====

Isaiah quoted God in [[en:bible:notes:isa:01:10|1:11-20]]. Isaiah is the speaker in 1:21-23.

Isaiah 1:29-31 is spoken to the people of Judah and Jerusalem. It is probably God speaking.
