====== Acts 23 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 23:5-9, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Whitewashed" ==
This is a common [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] in Scripture for those who appear [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteous]] but are not.

== Resurrection of the dead ==
The Pharisees believed that, after death, people would be raised from the dead for punishment or reward. The Sadducees did not share this belief. They only trusted in the physical world. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Called a curse ==
The made a promise to God that they would not eat or drink until they killed Paul and asked God to curse them if they did not follow their promise. This is not something that would have been pleased with, and they were clearly wrong for doing this. It is [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony|ironic]] that they used a [[:en:obe:kt:holy|holy]] vow in such an [[:en:obe:kt:unholy|unholy]] way. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Roman citizenship ==

Men who had Roman citizenship were given many privileges. They could appeal to Caesar if they were accused of a crime. Having Roman citizen was very valuable and people would go to great lengths to attain citizenship. This “chief captain” could have gotten into a lot of trouble for treating a Roman citizen in this way.
