  * **pay attention…be attentive** - This is saying the same thing twice to urge them to pay careful attention (See: Doublet)
  * **listen to my voice…listen to my words** - This is also saying the same thing in two different ways for emphasis.(See: Doublet)
  * **Does a farmer who plows all day to sow, only plow the ground?**  - This question is intended to make them think deeply. Alternate translation: "When a farmer plows some ground, does he never plant seeds?" (See: rhetorical question)
  * **does he continually break up and harrow the field?** - This is also a rhetorical question intended to make a point. "Does he continue to plow it and never plant anything?"
