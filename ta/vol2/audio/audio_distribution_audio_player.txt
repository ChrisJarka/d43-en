===== Audio Players =====

//This page answers the question:// //How is content distributed and listened to offline?//

There are many audio players being produced today by electronics manufacturers and ministry organizations. The ministry organizations have taken into consideration the many challenging contexts across the world in which people want to be able to listen to Biblical content and have designed players to meet that criteria. An example of device designed for an incredible level of versatility, durability and utility is the MegaVoice Envoy S player. The Envoy S is approximately the size and shape of a basic mobile phone and has many features highly tuned to the needs of recording teams, ministry leaders and end-users. Some of these features include:

  * Field programmable via miniUSB 
  * Tamper proof onboard memory
  * Extremely durable (proven to withstand being crushed by heavy vehicles and machinery and keep playing)
  * Can withstand hot, cold, wet and dry climate conditions.
  * Includes built-in speaker for individual or small group listening
  * Headphone jack for private listening
  * Built-in solar panel for recharging long-life, lithium-ion battery
  * MiniUSB port for additional charging options including power adapter, laptop USB port or other charging technology
  * Intuitive, tactile touch navigation buttons make navigation around any audio content such as Scripture, stories, or lessons very easy, especially the book, chapter verse structure of Biblical content.
  * End-user can bookmark their location at the end of a listening session
  * Can play continuously for hours on a single charge.

A feature set such as this on an audio player can provide a tremendous degree of needed flexibility, intuitiveness and self-sufficiency valued by ministry leaders, families and communities alike.

Dedicated audio players offer many advantages over options like mobile phones or radios, but they also have disadvantages that should also be considered. Typically, these audio players are:

  * not readily available in many local areas, making the hardware more difficult to obtain and service locally (typically done through regional networks)
  * require a financial investment upfront, typically by an outside mission-minded church or organization able to absorb the costs that would otherwise be too expensive for many end-users

It is important to mention that organizations creating audio players are not doing so in order to “sell hardware” as a lucrative money making idea. That idea is far from the truth. On the contrary, designing, testing and manufacturing field-worthy devices is an incredibly difficult and expensive task. The equipment is optimized for the needs, is more durable than consumer-grade electronics and is expensive to make on a smaller scale compared to mass-produced, cheap electronics. Accomplishing all of this and making these available at a mission-minded price point requires great commitment to wanting people to be able to hear God's message in their own language.

Without these audio players, many people would not be listening to Biblical content. This is especially true when considering that the vast majority of Biblical audio content currently has restricted-license terms applied by the copyright owner. Audio players have successfully bridged a difficult legal and relational problem, serving as a tangible, measurable representation of “a copy” that complies with license terms.
