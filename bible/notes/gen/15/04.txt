\v 4 Then, behold, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir; but rather the one that will come forth out of your own body will be your heir."
\v 5 Then he brought him outside, and said, "Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them." Then he said to him, "So will your descendants be."

  * **Then**  - This word helps move the story along and doesn't need to be translated. If your language has a word like this, use that word.
  * **This man will not be your heir**  - The phrase "This man" refers to Eliezer of Damascus. It can also be translated as "Your servant will not be your heir."
