===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: Parallelism)

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

  * **Jeshuran**  - This also refers to the people of Israel. (See: Translate Names ) This term comes from a word that means righteous.
  * **grew fat and kicked - ** Moses uses a metaphor to compare the people of Israel to an animal like an ox, that was well cared for, but instead of becoming gentle and righteous; turned away from Yahweh. AT: "became fat and rebelled"
  * **filled with fat, stout and sleek - **  Moses uses words with similar meaning to emphasize his idea. AT: "heavy, plump, and stuffed"
  * **Rock of his salvation**  - Moses is saying that Yahweh is as strong and solid as a rock (See:Metaphor)
  * **made Yahweh jealous **- Moses compares the relationship of Yahweh and the people of Israel to that of a married couple. See Isaiah 54:5
