====== First, Second or Third Person ======

First person is written from the speaker’s point of view. The pronoun “I” or “we” is used from the position of the speaker or writer.

Second person text tells what ‘you’ have done or ought to do.

Third person is told from the perspective of someone outside of the story. The pronouns “he”, “she”, “it” or “they” are used.

First person is the most common form used in speech; second person is used as a form of instruction; and third person is used as narration to express the view and knowledge of the narrator.

In some languages, person (or point of view) is usually communicated with a prefix or suffix, not a separate word. You should do what is most natural in your language. Furthermore, in some languages (including Greek) using the separate word for the personal pronoun indicates a special emphasis on that pronoun.

===== Examples from English =====

First person ~ “I gave the dog a bone.”

Second person ~ “You gave the dog a bone.”

Third person ~ “She gave the dog a bone.”

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Psalms 89:5-8** “The heavens praise your wonders, Lord, your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones. For who in the skies above can compare with the Lord? Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings? In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared; **he** is more awesome than all who surround him. Who is like **you**, Lord God Almighty? **You**, Lord, are mighty, and your faithfulness surrounds **you**.”

//Do you see how it changes back and forth from addressing God directly (**you**) to talking about him in the third person (**he**)? Many of the Psalms do this.//

**Job 40:6-9** ‘Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm: “Brace yourself like a man; **I** will question you, and you shall answer me. Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself? Do you have an arm like God’s, and can your voice thunder like **his**?”

//Here God speaks, first calling himself “I” then referring to himself in the third person.//

**Luke 13:15** ‘Then the Lord answered him, “**You** hypocrites! Does not each of **you** on the Sabbath untie **his** ox or **his** donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it?’

//Often when Jesus is teaching, he uses the second person. Sometimes, the instruction will switch to a third-person pronoun as it does in the above example. In those cases some languages might need to say "you" to keep the meaning clear.//
===== Translation Suggestions =====

Do what is natural and accurate in your own language. If your language does not use a separate word for person or voice, do not do so simply because the English uses that form.

It is important to note that sometimes in the Bible, the text changes from writing in the first person to the third person. You might not be able to do that in your language. Translate with one or the other but maintain accuracy and clarity.
