\v 13 My fellow believers, God chose you in order that you might live without having to obey rules and rituals. But do not assume that because you are free from having to obey rules and rituals, God permits you to do what your self-directed nature desires. Instead, constantly, as you love each other, serve each other.
\v 14 Keep in mind that we can sum up all of the laws that God has given us in one law, which is: "You must love each person you come in contact with, just like you love yourself."
\v 15 Since you are attacking and injuring each other by the things that you say, I warn you that if you continue doing that, you will totally ruin each other spiritually.

\v 13 For God called you, brothers, to freedom. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but instead through love serve one another.
\v 14 For the whole law stands fulfilled in one commandment, in this, "You must love your neighbor as yourself."
\v 15 But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.
