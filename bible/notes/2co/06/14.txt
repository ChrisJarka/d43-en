\v 14 Do not team up\f + \ft Or: have a close relationship \f* with anyone who does not trust  \add in Christ. I say this\add* because we who  \add trust in Christ and do\add* what is right should not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add want to do things\add* with wicked people. Or  \add to say it in another way\add*, just like light and darkness never join together, so  \add those who belong to Christ and those who belong to Satan should never join together\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\v 15 There is no \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* agreement of any kind between Christ and Satan. \add So\add*, believers have no \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* common interests with unbelievers.
\v 16  \add Just\add* as no one would  \add dare to bring\add* idols into the Temple  \add in Jerusalem\add*, believers should never \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* join with those who worship idols. \add I say that\add* because \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add the Holy Spirit lives in us, and so\add* we are  \add like\add* the Temple of the all-powerful God\add . It is\add* as God himself said  \add in the Scriptures\add*:
\q I will live in  \add my people\add*.
\q I will always be with\f + \ft Or: helping \f* them. 
\q  \add They will say to me\add*, "You are our God," and 
\q  \add I will say to them\add*, "You are my people."

\v 14 Do not be tied together with unbelievers. For what association does righteousness have with lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?
\v 15 What agreement does Christ have with Beliar? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?
\v 16 And what consent can the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said,
\q "I will dwell among them 
\q1 and I will live with them
\q and I will be their God, 
\q1 and they will be my people."
