\v 34 Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes  and looked and saw that many 
people were coming on the road on  the hillside behind him.
\v 35 Then Jonadab said to the king, "Look, the king’s sons are coming, just as your servant said, so it is."
\v 36 So it came about as soon as he had made an end of speaking that the king’s sons arrived and lifted up their
voices and wept. And the king and all his servants also wept bitterly.
