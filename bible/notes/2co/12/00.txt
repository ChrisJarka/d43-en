====== 2 Corinthians 12 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Paul continues his defense

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

**Paul's Vision**

Paul continues his defense as an apostle by telling about a wonderful vision of heaven he had. It was so great that God gave him a physical handicap to keep him humble. When he was with them, he proved himself an apostle by his powerful deeds. He has not ever taken anything from them and now that he is coming for the third time he still will not take anything. He is telling them this now so that when he comes he will not need to be harsh with them.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

**Rhetorical questions**

Paul uses many [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]] defending himself against accusations from his enemies: "For how were you less important than the rest of the churches, except that I was not a burden to you?" "Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same way? Did we not walk in the same steps?" "Do you think all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you?"

**Irony**

Paul uses [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony|Irony]] "Forgive me for this wrong!" when he reminds them how he had helped them at no cost to them. He says what he actually suspects his enemies might think he says :"But, since I am so crafty, I am the one who caught you by deceit" to introduce his defense against this accusation by showing how impossible it was to be true.

**Metaphor**

Paul used an extended [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]] to say he was willing to spend himself for their good: "For children should not save up for the parents. Instead, the parents should save up for the children."
