====== Mark 05 General Notes ======

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Past Events ==
Parts of this chapter are a narrative sequence of events that have already happen. Marks sometimes writes as if the events have already happened and at other times writes as if the events are still in progress. This can cause difficulty in translation by creating an illogical order of events. It may be necessary to make these consistent by writing as if all the events have already happened.

== "Talitha koum" ==
This is a phrase in Aramaic. Mark does not "translate" this phrase into Greek but chooses to "transliterate" or transfer it into Greek using Greek letters instead of Aramaic letters. The translators of the ULB and UDB have not translated this phrase either. The translator should try to form the sounds of this phrase without translating its meaning.
