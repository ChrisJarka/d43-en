\v 14 Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten
of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.
\v 15 Then he said to me, See, I have given you cow’s dung for man’s dung, and you shall prepare your bread thereon.
