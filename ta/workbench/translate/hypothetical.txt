====== Hypothetical Situations ======

This page answers the question: What is a hypothetical situation?

In order to understand this page, it would be good to read
  * [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_intro]]

If the sun stops shining… What if the sun stops shining… Suppose the sun stops shining… If only the sun had not stopped shining. You use such expressions to set up hypothetical situations, imagining what might have happened or what might happen. Or expressing regret over what did happen. These occur often in the Bible and need to be translated carefully.

==== Description ====

A hypothetical situation is one that is not real. It may include a condition and what would happen if that condition were met, or it may express emotion in a wish or regret about something that is not real.

Here are some conditions and what would happen if the condition were met. These can be in the past, present or future.
  * If he had known about the party, __he would have come to it__. (But he did not come.)
  * If he knew about the party, __he would be here__. (But he's not here.)
  * If he knew about the party, __he would come to it__. (But he probably won't come.)

Wishes can be about the past, present, or future.
  * I wish he had come.
  * I wish he were here.
  * I wish he would come.

Regrets can also be about the past, present, or future.
  * If only he had come.
  * If only he were here.
  * If only he would come.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

1. A hypothetical situation in the past

> “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. (Matthew 11:21 ULB)

Here in Matthew 11:21 Jesus said that if the people living in the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon had been able to see the miracles that he performed, they would have repented long ago. He said this to rebuke the people of Chorazin and Bethsaida who had seen his miracles yet did not repent. The people of Chorazin and Bethsaida did not actually see his miracles and repent. 

2. A hypothetical situation in the present

> Also, no man puts new wine into old wineskins. If he did that, the new wine would burst the skins, and the wine would be spilled, and the wineskins would be destroyed. (Luke 5:37 ULB)

This tells about what would happen if a person were to put new wine into old wineskins. But no one would do that. 

>Jesus said to them, "What man would there be among you, who, __if__  he had just one sheep, and if this sheep fell into a deep hole on the Sabbath, would not grasp hold of it and lift it out? (Matthew 12:11 ULB)

Jesus reminded the religious leaders of what they would do on the Sabbath if one of their sheep fell into a hole. He was not saying that their sheep would fall into a hole. He was showing them that they were wrong to judge him for healing people on the Sabbath. 

3. A hypothetical situation in the future
> __Unless those days are shortened, no flesh would be saved__; but for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened. (Matthew 24:22 ULB)


4. Expressing Emotion about a hypothetical situation 

**The Israelites said to them, "__If only we had died by Yahweh's hand in the land of Egypt when we were sitting by the pots of meat and were eating bread to the full.__ For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill our whole community with hunger." ** (Exodus 16:3 ULB)

Here the Israelites were afraid they would have to suffer and die of hunger in the wilderness, and so they wished that they had stayed in Egypt and died there with full stomachs.

> I know what you have done, and that you are neither cold nor hot. __I wish that you were either cold or hot!__ (Revelation 3:15 ULB)

==== Translation Strategies ====

It is important in translation to be able to recognize a hypothetical situation in the text and use appropriate words or phrases. You may need to show the timing of the hypothetical situation (past, present, or future). You may need to clarify that the scenario is only a possibility: that it might be true or not likely to be true or that it could possibly happen or would never happen. Hypothetical situations may or may not imply emotions or reasons. Some hypothetical statements may use expressions such as “what if,” “suppose,” or “if only” to help the reader understand the type of hypothetical situation. Perhaps your language uses special wording or specific language structures to communicate each of these things.

  * How would your language express a situation that could never happen?
  * How would you communicate a “suppose” scenario that could happen right now?
  * How would your language express a situation that may or may not happen in the future?
  * Does your language have a special way of indicating a hypothetical situation in the past?

How does your language express an “if only” or “I wish” scenario that also implies some emotion?
