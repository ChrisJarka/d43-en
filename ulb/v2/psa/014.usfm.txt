\c 14
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 The fool has said in his heart, There is no God.
\q They are corrupt, they have done abominable works;
\q There is none that does good.
\q
\v 2 Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men,
\q To see if there were any that did understand,
\q That did seek after God.
\q
\v 3 They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy;
\q There is none that does good, no, not one.
\q
\v 4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,
\q Who eat up my people as they eat bread,
\q And call not upon Jehovah?
\q
\v 5 There were they in great fear;
\q For God is in the generation of the righteous.
\q
\v 6 You put to shame the counsel of the poor,
\q Because Jehovah is his refuge.
\q
\v 7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!
\q When Jehovah brings back the captivity of his people,
\q Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
