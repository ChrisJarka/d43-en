**What is Judges about?**

Judges is the history of the time from the Conquest of the land until the [[:en:obe:kt:death|death]] of Samson. The book of Judges about the most important judges who ruled over Israel. These accounts follow a strict design. There is an introduction to the account; the people do what is [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil, wicked, wickedness]], an evil that usually remains hidden; Israel experiences difficulty and they fall under control of one of their enemies ; Israel call to Yahweh for help; Yahweh [[:en:obe:kt:raise|raises]] up a judge, a [[:en:obe:kt:deliverer|deliverer]] who is filled with the [[:en:obe:kt:spirit|Spirit]] of Yahweh; some victory over their enemies is achieved; then the judge dies; and the sequence is repeated until it is stopped by the giving of a king to the nation. The judges did not succeed in driving out the Canaanites under the judges. [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful|unfaithfulness]] to the covenant of Moses is important.

**How should the title of this book be translated?**  \\ These titles often describe the author or audience of the biblical book. Many titles summarize the contents of the book. It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or to follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). The name “Judges” is used because it talks about a time when the judges rescued. Despite their names, the Judges were more involved with military battles than other leadership responsibilities.

**Who wrote Judges?**\\

The author or authors of the book of Joshua is unknown. Scripture gives no indication about who wrote it, but it does state that it was written when Israel had a king.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**Were the Judges national or local leaders?**\\
While many of the Judges were leaders of the nation of Israel, the Bible leaves open the possibility that some of the Judges were only leaders of parts of Israel.

**Was Israel a unified country during the time of the Judges?**\\
It is incorrect to call Israel a true "nation" at this point in history. Many describe Israel as a loose confederacy of tribes or city-states. It may be best to describe Israel as many different tribes who share a common identity and come together for military battles.

**Did Israel worship one God or many [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]]?**\\
Israel knew the one, true God and some people did worship Yahweh.  After spending 400 years in Egypt and living in Canaan with many peoples who worshiped multiple gods, Israel struggled to remain [[:en:obe:kt:faithful|faithful]] to Yahweh during the time of the Judges. Some people viewed this as Israel's most significant issue during the period of the judges.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**What is the meaning of the phrase "in those days there was no king in Israel, and everyone did what was right in his own eyes?"**\\
This phrase indicates that when the author wrote these words, there was a king ruling the nation of Israel. There also an implication that the author was judging the people for not having a king.  Even though the author believed that the people needed a king, they were still wrong for having a king other than Yahweh.

**Should Judges be translated as a series of individual stories?**\\
No. While it is possible to see the book of Judges as a series of individual stories, it should be translated as a single unified book.   

**How should I translate the position of Judge?**\\
"Judge" can be an inaccurate word choice for the position of judge in the book of Judges. Despite their names, the Judges were more involved with military battles than other leadership responsibilities. Their focus is never on the [[:en:obe:kt:judge|judging]] between two people. Because of this, it may be better to translate using the title "leader," "military leader," "general" or "commander."
