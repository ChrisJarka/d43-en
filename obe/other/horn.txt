====== horn, horns ======

===== Facts: =====

Horns are permanent, hard, pointed growths on the heads of many types of cattle, sheep, and goats. The term "horn" is also used figuratively as a symbol of strength, power, authority, and royalty.

  * The horn of a ram (male sheep) was made into a musical instrument called a "ram's horn" or "shofar," which was blown for special events such as religious festivals.
  * God told the Israelites to make a horn-like projection on each of the four corners of the incense and brazen altars. Although these projections were called "horns," they were not actually animal horns.
  * The term "horn" was used to refer to a "flask" that was shaped like a horn and was used for holding water or oil. A flask of oil was used for anointing a king, as Samuel did with David.
  * This term should be translated with a word that is different from the word for a trumpet.
