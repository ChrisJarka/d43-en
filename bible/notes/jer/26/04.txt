\v 4-5 Say to them, 'This is what Yahweh says: I sent to you the prophets who serve me, to tell you what you should do. I sent them to you many times, but you have not paid attention to what they said. If you will not pay attention to what I say and do not obey the message that I have given to you, and if you do not pay attention to what the prophets say,
\v 6 I will destroy this temple like I destroyed Shiloh, \add the place where the Sacred Tent was put\add*. And I will cause Jerusalem to be a place whose name people in every nation on the earth will say when they curse someone.'~"

<usfm>
\v 4 And you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before
you,
\v 5 to listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you, even rising up early and sending them, but you
have not hearkened;
\v 6 then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
