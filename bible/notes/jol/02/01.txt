\v 1 Blow the trumpet in Zion,
\q And sound an alarm on my holy mountain!
\q Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble in fear,
\q For the day of Yahweh is coming;
\q Indeed, it is near.
\q
\v 2 It is a day of darkness and gloom,
\q A day of clouds and thick darkness.
\q Like the the dawn that spreads on the mountains,
\q A large and mighty army is approaching.
\q There has never been an army like it,
\q And there never will be again,
\q Even after many generations.
