\q
\v 12 The time is coming; the day has drawn near. Let not the buyer rejoice, 
\q nor the seller mourn, since my anger is upon the entire multitude!
\q
\v 13 For the seller will never return to that which is sold for as long as they live, 
\q since the vision is against the entire multitude: they will not return, 
\q for no man living in his sin will be strengthened!

===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues his prophecy of judgment on Israel through  Ezekiel.

  * **The time is coming; the day has drawn near**  - Both "The time" and "the day" refer to the time when God will punish the people of Israel. Alternative translation: "Israel's punishment will happen soon" (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
  * **the vision is against the entire multitude** - "what God has shown will happen, will happen to all of us"
  * **multitude** - a very large group
  * **as long as they live** - The word "they" refers to the people of Israel who sell things.
  * **they will not return**  - God is saying that the people who are taken from Israel will never return. Alternate translation: "The sellers will never come back to the land of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:implicit-explicit|Implicit and Explicit Information]])
  * **no man living in his sin will be strengthened**  - The word "strengthened" refers to God's helping a person to keep going when things are hard through hope, encouragement and physical energy. "no one alive who keeps disobeying God will be helped by God."
