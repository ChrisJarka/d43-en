\v 8 The angel said, "This is Wickedness!" He threw her back inside the basket, and he threw the lead cover over its opening.
\v 9 I lifted my eyes and saw two women coming toward me, and wind was in their wingsâ€”for they had wings like a stork's wings. They lifted up the basket between earth and heaven.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This is Wickedness** - The woman represents wickedness. AT: "This woman represents wickedness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **He threw her ... he threw the lead cover** - "He thrust her ... he forced the lead cover." The word "threw" indicates the force with which the angel did these things. He did not literally throw the woman or the cover.
  * **I lifted my eyes** - Here the word "eyes" represents the person who sees. AT: "I looked up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **wind was in their wings** - This idiom means that they were flying. AT: "they were flying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **they had wings like a stork's wings** - A stork is a type of large bird that has a wingspan of two to four meters. Zechariah compares the size of the women's wings with the size of the stork's wings.
  * **They lifted up the basket between earth and heaven** - The words "earth" and "heaven" form a merism that refer to the sky. It is implicit that the two women flew away with the basket. AT: "They lifted the basket up into the sky and flew away" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
