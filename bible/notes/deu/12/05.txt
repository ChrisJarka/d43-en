===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But to the place**  - Here he explains why they should not worship in the same way the other nations did.
  * **choose out of all your tribes**  - "choose from among all the tribes." From the territory divided between the tribes of Israel, Yahweh would chose one location for worship. (that later came to be Jerusalem, inside the territory of the tribe of Judah)
  * **that will be the place where he lives**  - "he will make his habitation there" or "he will make his dwelling there."
  * **it is there that you will go**  - Go for worship, that is. Not in the places where the other nations were going for worship.
  * **your offerings for vows, your freewill offerings**  - type of "fellowship offering, peace offering" (see complete list of Important Terms.) AT: "your offerings to fulfill a vow, your voluntary offerings." See how you translated in Leviticus 7:16, 22:21, 23:38 and Numbers 15:3, 29:39.
  * **the firstborn of your herds and flocks**  - God requires that every firstborn male be set apart for him.

the important term "chosen one" is misleading for the word "choose" in the ULB text**
