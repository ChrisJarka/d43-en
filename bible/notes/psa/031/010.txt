===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 I have become very weak because I am so miserable,
\q2 and it is causing my life to become shorter.
\q1 I have become weak because of all my troubles;
\q2 even my bones are becoming weaker.
\q1
\v 11 All of my enemies make fun of me,
\q2 and even my neighbors despise me.
\q1 Even my friends are afraid of me \add because they think I am being punished by God\add*,
\q2 and when they see me on the streets, they run away.
\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 10 For my life is spent with sorrow,
\q And my years with sighing:
\q My strength fails because of mine iniquity,
\q And my bones are wasted away.
\q
\v 11 Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach,
\q Yea, to my neighbors exceedingly,
\q And a fear to mine acquaintance:
\q They that did see me without fled from me.
</usfm>
