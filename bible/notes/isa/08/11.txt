  * **Yahweh of Hosts, him you will treat as holy; him you will fear, him you will be in awe of** - If you translate this as a direct quote you can also translate it with Yahweh speaking in the first person: "But, you will consider me, Yahweh of Hosts, as holy. And, you will fear and be in awe of me."
