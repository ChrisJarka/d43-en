\v 32 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all
the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day
that he forced his sister Tamar.
\v 33 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon
only is dead.
