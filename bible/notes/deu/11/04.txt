\v 4 Think about what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots. Think about how he caused the Sea of Reeds to flood and sweep away their army as they were coming after your ancestors. Think about how they have suffered from that even until now.

Moses continues speaking to the adult Israelites who were old enough to see what God did in Egypt.

  * **Neither did they see what he did ** - "Neither did your children see what Yahweh did"
  * **they pursued after you** - Here "you" means the Israelites who were alive about 40 years earlier.
  * **to this place** - This means the plain of the Jordan River Valley where Moses is speaking to them before they cross over into Canaan.
