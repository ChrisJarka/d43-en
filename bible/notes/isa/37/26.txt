\v 26 Have you not heard how I determined it long ago and worked it out in ancient times? 
         Now  I am bringing it to pass. You are here to reduce fortified cities into heaps of ruins.
\v 27 Therefore their inhabitants were of little strength, they are shattered and ashamed. 
         They are short lived like plants in the field,
          and as the green shoots or the grass on the housetops, and as a field of grain dried up by the east wind before it is grown up.
