\v 31 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his
motherâ€™s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\v 32 And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.
\v 33 And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the
land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
