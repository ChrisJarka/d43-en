\v 17 Christ sent me not \add primarily\add* to baptize people but to preach the good message about him. When I do that, he does not want me to use words that human philosophers \add consider\add* wise \f + \ft irony \f*. I do not want the message about \add what\add* he \add accomplished when he was nailed to\add* the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f* to lose its power.

<usfm>
\v 17 Christ did not send me to baptize people but to tell everyone the message about him; and to do this not with clever words of human wisdom, so that the power of the cross would be displayed and not emptied out.
