===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **debtor**  - explanation
    * **He called… he said… **- there are a lot of pronouns here. They refer either to the rich man's manager, or the various people who had borrowed from the rich man, and owned him a repayment.
    * **a hundred measures of olive oil **- The measurement unit here in the original language is the "batos" or "bath," about 34 liters; so the literal measurement here is around 3400 liters of olive oil.
    * **a hundred measures of wheat**  - The measurement unit here in the original language is the "koros" or "kor," about 220 dry liters; so the literal measurement here is around 22,000 dry liters of wheat grain.
    * **he called… he asked…**  - In v. 5, this is the manager speaking.
