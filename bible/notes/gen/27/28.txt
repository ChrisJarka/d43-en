  * **dew from heaven**  - "mist in the air" or "rain from the sky"
  * **and of the fatness of the earth**  - The word "fatness of the earth" is an idiom which means "fertile land" or "a land that produces plenty." This could be translated as "and good soil for producing crops." (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])
