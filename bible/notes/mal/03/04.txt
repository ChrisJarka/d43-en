\v 4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.
\v 5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers,
and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and
that turn aside the sojourner from his right, and fear not me, says Jehovah of hosts.
