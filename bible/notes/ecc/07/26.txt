\q1
\v 26 I found that more bitter than death is any woman
\q2 whose heart is full of snares and nets,
\q2 and whose hands are chains.
\q1 Whoever pleases God will escape from her,
\q2 but the sinner will be taken by her.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **any woman whose heart is full of snares and nets, and whose hands are chains** - The writer says that the seductive woman is like traps that hunters use to catch animals. The author speaks of a woman being seductive as if she traps men like a hunter traps animals. Her "heart" represents her thoughts and emotions. AT: "any woman who traps men by seducing them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **snares and nets** - These two words both refer to ways in which people trap animals to emphasize how the woman traps men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **whose hands are chains** - Here the word "hands" refers her power and control. This speaks of her being seductive as if hands were chains that she bound people with. AT: "from whom no one can escape" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the sinner will be taken by her** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "she will capture the sinner" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
