=== What is Lamentations about? ===

The prophet Jeremiah laments or expresses his grief over the destruction of Jerusalem and the burning of the temple. He records his sorrow in 5 poems focusing on the people's [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] and [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful|unfaithfulness]] but he remembers God's [[:en:obe:kt:faithful|faithfulness]].


=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Lamentations" may also be called the "Poems of sadness" or "The sad sayings of Jeremiah."

=== Who wrote Lamentations? ===

The name of the author of Lamentations is not given in the text, but there is broad agreement that the author was Jeremiah. It is fitting that a lament was made over the fall and destruction Jerusalem.
The eyewitness nature of the laments seems to fit closely with the book of Jeremiah. Certainly the serious and grieving tone of Jeremiah is carried into the book of Lamentations, and there is nothing to suggest that Jeremiah was not the author. 


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Did God abandon Israel? ===

Jeremiah often uses the imagery of abandonment in Lamentations, but this does not mean that God had completely given up on Israel. He will remain faithful to his covenant promises. He has rejected Israel as the dwelling place of his presence. While this imagery was common in the ancient Neat East, it was usually caused by the weakness of the people's [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|god]]. In Lamentations, the abandonment is caused by the sinfulness of the people and is a display of Yahweh's power.

=== What is a funeral song? ===

It is common for cultures to sing songs at a funeral or when someone has died. Depending on the culture, these songs can sound happy or sad. Lamentations is somewhat reminiscent of a sad song sung at a funeral, also called a "dirge". Some have said that the rhythm of the poem in Hebrew makes the poems sound like they limp or are sluggish, like a funeral procession. It also calls for the people to repent and return to Yahweh.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What style of writing is Lamentations? ===

Lamentations is a collection of five poems. These laments may have been sung (or chanted) by the Jewish exiles living in captivity in Babylon, and also by those Jews who remained in Jerusalem after its conquest. In Chapters 1,2 and 4 each line of the poem begins with a different Hebrew letter in alphabetical order. The third chapter repeats three lines with the same letter followed by the next three lines beginning with next letter in alphabetical order. 

=== Who are the woman and the man in Lamentations? ===

The author describes a woman who has been left or abandoned and a man who has been persecuted to represent Judah or Jerusalem. This is a type of [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|personification]] used the make the pain more relatable to the reader.
