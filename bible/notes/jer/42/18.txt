\v 18 For thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As mine anger and my wrath has been poured forth upon the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth upon you, when you shall enter into Egypt; and you shall be an
execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.
\v 19 Jehovah has spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah, Go you not into Egypt: know certainly that I have testified to
you this day.
