\v 13-14 \add Then Jesus said to the religious leaders\add*, "You men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees are hypocrites! There will be terrible punishment for \add you, because by teaching what is false\add*, you \add prevent people\add* [MTY\f + \ft Or: HYP \f*] \add who are thinking about letting\add* God rule their lives \add from doing that\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add What you are doing is like\add* closing a gate \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add so that people who\add* are wanting to enter \add a city cannot go in\add*. As for \bd you,\bd* \add you do not let\add* God \add rule your lives. Neither do you allow\add* other people \add to let God rule their lives. What you do is like\add* not going into a \add house\add* yourselves, and not allowing others to enter it \add either\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.\f + \fk very \fk* severely."\f*"

\v 15 "You are hypocrites, you men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees! Your punishment will be terrible, because you exert yourselves very much to get \add even\add* one person to believe what you teach. For instance, you travel across seas and lands \add to distant places\add* in order to do that. And \add as a result\add*, when one person \add believes what you teach\add*, you make that person much more deserving to go to hell than you yourselves \add deserve to\add*."

\v 13 But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men: for you enter not
in yourselves, neither suffer you them that are entering in to enter.
\v 14 \f + Some authorities insert here, or after v. 12, v. 14 \fqa Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you
devour widowsâ€™ houses, even while for a pretense you make long prayours: therefore you shall receive greater
condemnation.\f*
\v 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is become
so, you make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves.
