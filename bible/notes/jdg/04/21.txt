<usfm>
\v 21 Sisera was very exhausted, so he soon was asleep. While he was sleeping, Jael crept quietly to him, holding a hammer and a tent peg. She pounded the peg into his skull, and all the way through his head into the ground, and he died.
\p
\v 22 When Barak came to Jael's tent to look for Sisera, she went out to greet him. She said, "Come in, and I will show you the man you are searching for!" So he followed her into the tent, and he saw Sisera lying there, dead, with the tent peg through his head.

\v 21 Then Jael Heber’s wife took a tent peg and a hammer in her hand and went softly to him, and drove the tent peg into his temple; it pierced through him into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep; so died.
\v 22 Behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come and I will show you the man whom you are looking for.” He came to her, and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temple.
