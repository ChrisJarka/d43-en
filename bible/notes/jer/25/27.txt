\v 27 Then \add in the vision\add* Yahweh said to me, "Tell them that this is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says: 'Drink from this cup \add some of the wine that represents the punishment that I will give you\add*. Drink a lot of it and become drunk and vomit. You will fall down and not get up again, because I will cause you to be killed in wars \f + \ft metonymy \f* that I will send to you.
\v 28 If any of those to whom you give this wine \f + \ft metonymy \f* refuse to drink it, tell them that the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says that they must drink it.
\v 29 I am starting to bring disaster to my own \f + \ft metonymy \f* city. \add Do you think that\add* you should not be punished \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? No, you will surely be punished \f + \ft litotes \f* because I am sending wars to all the nations on the earth. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, have said it.'

\p
\v 27 And you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and
fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
\v 28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then shall you say to them, Thus says Jehovah
of hosts: You shall surely drink.
\v 29 For, lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should you be utterly unpunished? You shall not
be unpunished; for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, says Jehovah of hosts.
