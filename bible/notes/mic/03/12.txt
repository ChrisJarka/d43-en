===== translationNotes: =====

  * **because of you** - Here "you" refers to the priests, prophets, and leaders ([[:en:bible:notes:mic:03:09|3:11]]).
  * **Zion will become a plowed field ... and the hill of the temple will become a thicket** - "Zion" and "the hill of the temple" refer to the same place. When a farmer plows a field, he turns over all the dirt and uproots all the plants that are growing there. A thicket is so full of bushes that no one can use it for anything. These two metaphors cannot be literally true at the same time, but they emphasize that Yahweh will allow the invaders to completely destroy the temple area. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a plowed field** - "a field that a farmer has plowed"
  * **a thicket** - a place where many small woody plants grow
