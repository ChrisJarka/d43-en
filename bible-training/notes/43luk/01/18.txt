\v 18 And Zechariah said to the angel, "How will I know this will happen? For I am an old man, and my wife also is very old."
\v 19 And the angel answered him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to
you\f + \ft singular \f*\, and to bring you this good news. 
\v 20 And indeed, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day when these things happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at the proper time."
