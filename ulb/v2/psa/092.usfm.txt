\d A Psalm, a Song for the sabbath day.
\q
\v 1 It is a good thing to give thanks to Jehovah,
\q And to sing praises to your name, O Most High;
\q
\v 2 To show forth your lovingkindness in the morning,
\q And your faithfulness every night,
\q
\v 3 With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery;
\q With a solemn sound upon the harp.
\q
\v 4 For thou, Jehovah, have made me glad through your work:
\q I will triumph in the works of your hands.
\q
\v 5 How great are your works, O Jehovah!
\q Your thoughts are very deep.
\q
\v 6 A brutish man knows not;
\q Neither does a fool understand this:
\q
\v 7 When the wicked spring as the grass,
\q And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;
\q It is that they shall be destroyed for ever.
\q
\v 8 But thou, O Jehovah, are on high for evermore.
\q
\v 9 For, lo, your enemies, O Jehovah,
\q For, lo, your enemies shall perish;
\q All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
\q
\v 10 But my horn have you exalted like the horn of the wild-ox:
\q I am anointed with fresh oil.
\q
\v 11 Mine eye also has seen my desire on mine enemies,
\q Mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me.
\q
\v 12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree:
\q He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
\q
\v 13 They are planted in the house of Jehovah;
\q They shall flourish in the courts of our God.
\q
\v 14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;
\q They shall be full of sap and green:
\q
\v 15 To show that Jehovah is upright;
\q He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
