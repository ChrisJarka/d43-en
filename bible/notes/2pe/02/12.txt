\v 12 Because those teachers of false doctrines are like animals that cannot think as humans do, they say evil things about spiritual things concerning which they know nothing. As a result, God will destroy them like people destroy animals, animals that are born only in order to be captured and destroyed.
\v 13 God will punish those teachers in return for the unrighteous actions that they have done. It even pleases them to carouse in the daytime as well as at night. And as they indulge themselves just like they want to while they are feasting with you, they defile you greatly, as stains and blotches defile a clean garment.
\v 14 They want to commit adultery with every woman whom they look at. They never stop seeking opportunities to sin. They entice those who are spiritually unstable to join them in doing the sinful things that they do. Because of their ever-increasing greed, they are doomed to eternal punishment.

\v 12 But these mindless animals are naturally made for capture and destruction. They do not know what they insult. They will be destroyed.
\v 13 They are harmed by the reward of their wrongdoing. They live in pleasure during the day. They are stains and blemishes. They enjoy their deceitful pleasures while they feast with you.
\v 14 They have eyes full of adulterous women; they are never satisfied with sin. They entice unstable souls into wrondoing, and they have their hearts trained in covetousness, cursed children.
