\c 13
\p
\v 1 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for
uncleanness.
\v 2 And it shall come to pass in that day, says Jehovah of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land,
and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
\v 3 And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that became the father of him shall say to
him, You shall not live; for you speak lies in the name of Jehovah; and his father and his mother that became the father of him shall
thrust him through when he prophesieth.
\v 4 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he prophesieth;
neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:
\v 5 but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondman from my youth.
\v 6 And one shall say to him, What are these wounds between your arms? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded
in the house of my friends.
\p
\v 7 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, says Jehovah of hosts: strike the shepherd,
and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn my hand upon the little ones.
\v 8 And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, says Jehovah, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third
shall be left therein.
\v 9 And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is
tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, Jehovah is my God.
