There was a prevailing Jewish belief that if you were sick or disabled it was because you or your parents had sinned. Hence when the disciples asked Jesus in the case of the man born blind, (John 9:1-3) "who sinned"? The Jews believed that illness was a punishment inflicted because of sin.


There were many instances of healing and /miracles by the disciples in Acts. (Acts 5:12).
