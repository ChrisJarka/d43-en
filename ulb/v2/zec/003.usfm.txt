\c 3
\p
\v 1 And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be
his adversary.
\v 2 And Jehovah said to Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan; yea, Jehovah that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not
this a brand plucked out of the fire?
\v 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.
\v 4 And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And to him he
said, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich apparel.
\v 5 And I said, Let them set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with
garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing by.
\p
\v 6 And the angel of Jehovah protested to Joshua, saying,
\v 7 Thus says Jehovah of hosts: If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my charge, then you also shall judge my
house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these that stand by.
\v 8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign: for,
behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.
\v 9 For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving
thereof, says Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
\v 10 In that day, says Jehovah of hosts, shall you invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree.
