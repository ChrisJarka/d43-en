\d A Prayer of Moses the man of God.
\q
\v 1 Lord, you have been our dwelling-place
\q In all generations.
\q
\v 2 Before the mountains were brought forth,
\q Or ever you had formed the earth and the world,
\q Even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
\q
\v 3 You turn man to destruction,
\q And sayoust, Return, you children of men.
\q
\v 4 For a thousand years in your sight
\q Are but as yesterday when it is past,
\q And as a watch in the night.
\q
\v 5 You carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
\q In the morning they are like grass which grows up.
\q
\v 6 In the morning it flourisheth, and grows up;
\q In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
\q
\v 7 For we are consumed in your anger,
\q And in your wrath are we troubled.
\q
\v 8 You have set our iniquities before thee,
\q Our secret sins in the light of your countenance.
\q
\v 9 For all our days are passed away in your wrath:
\q We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
\q
\v 10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten,
\q Or even by reason of strength fourscore years;
\q Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow;
\q For it is soon gone, and we fly away.
\q
\v 11 Who knows the power of your anger,
\q And your wrath according to the fear that is due to thee?
\q
\v 12 So teach us to number our days,
\q That we may get us a heart of wisdom.
\q
\v 13 Return, O Jehovah; how long?
\q And let it repent you concerning your servants.
\q
\v 14 Oh satisfy us in the morning with your lovingkindness,
\q That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
\q
\v 15 Make us glad according to the days wherein you have afflicted us,
\q And the years wherein we have seen evil.
\q
\v 16 Let your work appear to your servants,
\q And your glory upon their children.
\q
\v 17 And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us;
\q And establish you the work of our hands upon us;
\q Yea, the work of our hands establish you it.
