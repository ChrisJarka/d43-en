\v 3 When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
\v 4 they acted with a cunning plan. They went and supplied themselves with provisions and they took worn-out sacks and put them on their donkeys, and they put old wine skins that were worn, torn, and repaired. 
\v 5 They put old and patched shoes on their feet, and their clothers were worn-out. All the bread in their provision was dry and moldy.
