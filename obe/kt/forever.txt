====== forever ======

===== Definition: =====

Forever can mean all future time, a very long time, or the entire period of all time.

  * An example of the first meaning would be, "The kingdom of God will last forever."
  * The second usage, meaning a long time, would be, "We waited a very long time. It seemed like forever."
  * The final meaning is exemplified by Psalm 90:2, which states that the Lord is God from everlasting to everlasting, which means He never began, and He will never end.
