\v 12 Do not forget that the seventh day \add of every week\add* is mine and dedicate those days to me just like I, Yahweh your God, am commanding you.

\v 13 There are six days each week for you to do all your work,
\v 14 but the seventh day is a rest day, a day dedicated to me, Yahweh your God. On that day you must not do any work. You and your sons and daughters and your male and female slaves must not work. You must not even force your livestock to work, and you must not tell foreigners to work, those who are living in your country. You must allow your slaves to rest on that day just like you do.

\p
\v 12 Observe the Sabbath day so that you keep it holy, as Yahweh your God commanded you.
\v 13 For six days you will labor and do all your work,
\v 14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath in honor of Yahweh your God; in it you will not do any workâ€”neither you, nor your sons, nor your daughters, nor your male servants, nor your female servants, nor your oxen, nor your donkeys, nor any of your cattle, nor any foreigner who is on your land. This is so that your male and female servants may rest as well as you.
