<usfm>
\v 28 If one of you desired to build a tower, would you not first sit down and determine how much it would cost? Then you would be able to determine whether you had enough money to complete it.
\v 29 Otherwise, if you laid the foundation and were not able to finish the rest of the tower, everyone who saw it would make fun of you.
\v 30 They would say, 'This man started to build a tower, but he was not able to finish it!'

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 For which of you, who desires to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost -- to calculate if he has what he needs to complete it?
\v 29 Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to mock him,
\v 30 saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'
