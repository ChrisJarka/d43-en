\v 54 Because of that, Jesus no longer traveled around publicly among his Jewish opponents. Instead, he left Jerusalem, and with the disciples they went to a village called Ephraim, in an area near the wilderness and desert region. There he stayed with his disciples for a while.
\p
\v 55 Now it was almost time for the Jewish Passover celebration and many worshippers went up from the country and the villages to Jerusalem. They would wash themselves in preparation, to make themselves clean according to the Jewish rules, so they would be allowed to celebrate the Passover.

city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.
\v 55 Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify
themselves.
