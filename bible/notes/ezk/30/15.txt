===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to describe the way he will punish Egypt.
  * **For I will pour out my fury upon Sin** - "For I will act in anger against Sin" or "Because I am angry, I will do bad things to Sin" 
  * **Sin** - This was an important city in northen Egypt. It was also called Pelusium. (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]])
  * **stronghold** - A stronghold is a place that is well protected from enemies by strong buildings and by fighting men. 
  * **cut off the multitude of No **- "kill the very large number of people in No"
  * **No**  - See how you translated the name of this city in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:30:13|3:14]].
  * **Then I will set fire in Egypt** - "I will burn Egypt with fire"
  * **will be in grievous anguish **- "will be in great pain" or "will feel great pain"
  * **No will be broken up** - When enemies destroy the city of No, it is compared to something fragile being broken up. When a stick, a clay pot, or something made of glass has been broken, it cannot be put back together. In the same way, enemies will destroy No, and the city will have no hope of being saved. Alternate translation, "No will be completely destroyed."
  * **Memphis** - Memphis was a very important city in Egypt. It was little bit south of where Cairo is today.
  * **Memphis will have enemies in their day** - "When I bring punishment on Memphis, enemies will attack them" (This note might need to be changed depending on what the text team decides to do with יומם.)
