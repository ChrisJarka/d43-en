\c 4

\v 1 When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
\v 2 (although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),
\v 3 he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
\v 4 And he must needs pass through Samaria.
\v 5 So he comes to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:
\v 6 and Jacobâ€™s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth
hour.
\v 7 There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus says to her, Give me to drink.
\v 8 For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.
\v 9 The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, asked drink of me, who am a Samaritan
woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink;
you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.
\v 11 The woman says to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then have you that living
water?
\v 12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?
\v 13 Jesus answered and said to her, Every one that drinks of this water shall thirst again:
\v 14 but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall
become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.
\v 15 The woman says to him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.
\v 16 Jesus says to her, Go, call your husband, and come hither.
\v 17 The woman answered and said to him, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, You said well, I have no husband:
\v 18 for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband: this have you said truly.
\v 19 The woman says to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
\v 20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
\v 21 Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall you
worship the Father.
\v 22 You worship that which you know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.
\v 23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such does
the Father seek to be his worshippers.
\v 24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.
\v 25 The woman says to him, I know that Messiah comes (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare to us
all things.
\v 26 Jesus says to her, I that speak to you am he.
\p
\v 27 And upon this came his disciples; and they marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seek
you? or, Why speak you with her?
\v 28 So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and says to the people,
\v 29 Come, see a man, who told me all things that ever I did: can this be the Christ?
\v 30 They went out of the city, and were coming to him.
\v 31 In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
\v 32 But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you know not.
\v 33 The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him
anything to eat?
\v 34 Jesus says to them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.
\v 35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then comes the harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes,
and look on the fields, that they are white already to harvest.
\v 36 He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathers fruit to life eternal; that he that sows and he that reapeth may
rejoice together.
\v 37 For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
\v 38 I sent you to reap that whereon you have not labored: others have labored, and you are entered into their labor.
\p
\v 39 And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all
things that ever I did.
\v 40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they implored him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.
\v 41 And many more believed because of his word;
\v 42 and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that
this is indeed the Saviour of the world.
\p
\v 43 And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.
\v 44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
\v 45 So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the
feast: for they also went to the feast.
\p
\v 46 He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son
was sick at Capernaum.
\v 47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went to him, and implored
him that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
\v 48 Jesus therefore said to him, Except you see signs and wonders, you will in no wise believe.
\v 49 The nobleman says to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
\v 50 Jesus says to him, Go your way; your son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his
way.
\v 51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.
\v 52 So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the
fever left him.
\v 53 So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son liveth: and himself believed,
and his whole house.
\v 54 This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.
