\v 15 No longer will the other people-groups ridicule you mountains. No longer will they laugh at you; no longer will their armies conquer you. I, the Lord Yahweh, am telling you this myself.'"

\v 13 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because they are saying to you, “You devour men, and your nation has become bereaved of children,”
\v 14 therefore you will not consume people any longer, and you will no longer bereave your nation. This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 15 Nor will I allow you to hear the insults of the nations any longer; you will no longer have to bear the shame of the peoples or cause your nation to stagger and fall.' This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”
