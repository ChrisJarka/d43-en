== David told to stop mourning Absalom ==
Joab warned David that if he continued to mourn Absalom and not thank his army, they would all desert him. So David went out to encourage the soldiers. 
== David made king again ==
Israel discussed among themselves that, since David had saved them from the Philistines, they should bring him back as their king. David asked the tribe of Judah why they were hesitating to bring him back as king when he was from their tribe. He told Absalom's army chief, Amasa that he would make him army chief, instead of Joab. So Amasa persuaded Judah to make David their king again.  So all Israel invited him back as king. 

The people of Judah came to ferry David across the Jordan River. Shemei came to ask David to forgive him for cursing him as he left Jerusalem; and David said he would not punish him. Barzillai, who had provided David's army with food, came down to the river. David told him to come with him and he would treat him very well. But Barzillai was old and wanted to stay home but asked David to reward his son instead.
== The ten tribes and Judah argue over David ==
The ten tribes of Israel argued with the tribe of Judah for their being the ones to ferry David across the river. But the men of Judah answered the ten tribes very harshly.
