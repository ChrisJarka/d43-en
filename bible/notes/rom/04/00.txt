====== Romans 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 4:7-8, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The purpose of the Law of Moses ==
Paul builds upon material from chapter 3 and explains how Abraham, the father of Israel, was [[:en:obe:kt:justify|justified]]. Obedience cannot justify a person, even the great Abraham. The [[:en:obe:ktlawofmoses|Law of Moses]] does not justify a person, it is a way a person displays their [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]] in God. It is faith which has always justified a person.

== Circumcision ==
[[:en:obe:kt:circumcise|Circumcision]] was important to the Israelites. It identified a person as a descendant of Abraham and was a sign of the [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenant]] between Abraham and Yahweh. Paul explains that one of the reasons for circumcision was its practice was a display of the Israelite's faith. The practice of circumcision itself was not able to justify anyone.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
These are frequently used in this chapter. It appears the intent of these [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] is to make the reader feel [[:en:obe:kt:guilt|guilty]], or to convict them of their [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] and ultimately bring them to faith in Jesus.
