\v 3 'Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Is it not like nothing in your eyes?
\v 4 Now, be strong, Zerubbabel!'--this is Yahweh's declaration--'and be strong, high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak; and be strong, all you people of the land!'--this is Yahweh's declaration--'and work, for I am with you!'--this is Yahweh of Host's declaration.
\v 5 'According to the covenant that I established with you when you came out of Egypt and my Spirit stood in your midst, do not fear!' [[I changed dbr to "covenant" to avoid the awkward "covenanted" and the obscure "cut" yet still make the covenant context absolutely clear.]]
