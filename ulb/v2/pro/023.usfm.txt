\c 23
\q
\v 1 When you sit to eat with a ruler,
\q Consider diligently him that is before thee;
\q
\v 2 And put a knife to your throat,
\q If you be a man given to appetite.
\q
\v 3 Be not desirous of his dainties;
\q Seeing they are deceitful food.
\q
\v 4 Weary not yourself to be rich;
\q Cease from your own wisdom.
\q
\v 5 Wilt you set your eyes upon that which is not?
\q For riches certainly make themselves wings,
\q Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven.
\q
\v 6 Eat you not the bread of him that has an evil eye,
\q Neither desire you his dainties:
\q
\v 7 For as he thinks within himself, so is he:
\q Eat and drink, says he to thee;
\q But his heart is not with thee.
\q
\v 8 The morsel which you have eaten shall you vomit up,
\q And lose your sweet words.
\q
\v 9 Speak not in the hearing of a fool;
\q For he will despise the wisdom of your words.
\q
\v 10 Remove not the ancient landmark;
\q And enter not into the fields of the fatherless:
\q
\v 11 For their Redeemer is strong;
\q He will plead their cause against thee.
\q
\v 12 Apply your heart to instruction,
\q And your ears to the words of knowledge.
\q
\v 13 Withhold not correction from the child;
\q For if you beat him with the rod, he will not die.
\q
\v 14 You shall beat him with the rod,
\q And shall deliver his soul from Sheol.
\q
\v 15 My son, if your heart be wise,
\q My heart will be glad, even mine:
\q
\v 16 Yea, my heart will rejoice,
\q When your lips speak right things.
\q
\v 17 Let not your heart envy sinners;
\q But be you in the fear of Jehovah all the day long:
\q
\v 18 For surely there is a reward;
\q And your hope shall not be cut off.
\q
\v 19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise,
\q And guide your heart in the way.
\q
\v 20 Be not among winebibbers,
\q Among gluttonous eaters of flesh:
\q
\v 21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty;
\q And drowsiness will clothe a man with rags.
\q
\v 22 Listen to your father that became the father of thee,
\q And despise not your mother when she is old.
\q
\v 23 Buy the truth, and sell it not;
\q Yea, wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
\q
\v 24 The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice;
\q And he that begetteth a wise child will have joy of him.
\q
\v 25 Let your father and your mother be glad,
\q And let her that bare you rejoice.
\q
\v 26 My son, give me your heart;
\q And let your eyes delight in my ways.
\q
\v 27 For a harlot is a deep ditch;
\q And a foreign woman is a narrow pit.
\q
\v 28 Yea, she lies in wait as a robber,
\q And increases the treacherous among men.
\q
\v 29 Who has woe? who has sorrow? who has contentions?
\q Who has complaining? who has wounds without cause?
\q Who has redness of eyes?
\q
\v 30 They that wait long at the wine;
\q They that go to seek out mixed wine.
\q
\v 31 Look not you upon the wine when it is red,
\q When it sparkleth in the cup,
\q When it goes down smoothly:
\q
\v 32 At the last it biteth like a serpent,
\q And stingeth like an adder.
\q
\v 33 Your eyes shall behold strange things,
\q And your heart shall utter perverse things.
\q
\v 34 Yea, you shall be as he that lies down in the midst of the sea,
\q Or as he that lies upon the top of a mast.
\q
\v 35 They have stricken me, shall you say, and I was not hurt;
\q They have beaten me, and I felt it not:
\q When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
