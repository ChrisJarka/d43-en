\c 17
\p
\v 1 And he said to his disciples, It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe to him, through
whom they come!
\v 2 It were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he
should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
\v 3 Take heed to yourselves: if your brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
\v 4 And if he sin against you seven times in the day, and seven times turn again to you, saying, I repent; you shall
forgive him.
\p
\v 5 And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.
\v 6 And the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you would say to this sycamine tree, Be you rooted up,
and be you planted in the sea; and it would obey you.
\v 7 But who is there of you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say to him, when he is come in from the
field, Come straightway and sit down to meat;
\v 8 and will not rather say to him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and
drunken; and afterward you shall eat and drink?
\v 9 Doth he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded?
\v 10 Even so you also, when you shall have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we
have done that which it was our duty to do.
\p
\v 11 And it came to pass, as they were on the way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.
\v 12 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off:
\v 13 and they lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
\v 14 And when he saw them, he said to them, Go and show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they
were cleansed.
\v 15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God;
\v 16 and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
\v 17 And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine?
\v 18 Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger?
\v 19 And he said to him, Arise, and go your way: your faith has made you whole.
\p
\v 20 And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God comes
not with observation:
\v 21 neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo, the kingdom of God is within you.
\p
\v 22 And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you
shall not see it.
\v 23 And they shall say to you, Lo, there! Lo, here! go not away, nor follow after
them:
\v 24 for as the lightning, when it lightens out of the one part under the heaven, shineth to the other part under heaven;
so shall the Son of man be in his day.
\v 25 But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.
\v 26 And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
\v 27 They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the
flood came, and destroyed them all.
\v 28 Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they
builded;
\v 29 but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all:
\v 30 after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.
\v 31 In that day, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let
him that is in the field likewise not return back.
\v 32 Remember Lotâ€™s wife.
\v 33 Whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it: but whoever shall lose
his life shall preserve it.
\v 34 I say to you, In that night there shall be two men on one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
\v 35 There shall be two women grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
\v 36 \f + Some ancient authorities add v. 36. \fqa There shall be two men in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other
shall be left.\f*
\v 37 And they answering say to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Where the body
is, there will the eagles also be gathered together.
