===== Description =====

Summary \\ 
When you handle pronouns in the way your language likes, people will easily understand who and what your translation is about.\\  

Definition \\ 
Pronouns are used to keep track of people or things without having to always repeat the noun. Usually a new person in a story will be first mentioned with a descriptive phrase, then the second time he will be mentioned with a simple name or noun but after that he will be referred to by a pronoun as long as it is clear who is being spoken of.\\  
Example \\ 
Now there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish Council. This man came to Jesus … Jesus replied to him \\ 

But each language has its particular rules and exceptions to this usual way of doing it. In languages in which the subject is marked in the verb, frequently pronouns are only used if the reference is unclear or is emphatic. In some language the main character is always referred to by a pronoun but in others he is only referred to by a name or noun and some languages have special pronouns for the main character. In many languages a noun is used instead of  pronouns when starting a new story or even a new paragraph. Most pronouns refer to something or someone already mentioned, however some languages allow a pronoun to precede the noun it replaces.

==== Reason this could be a translation issue ==== 
Understand pronouns in the Bible and knowing how to use pronouns in your translation are crucial for producing a translation that will be clearly understood.


===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Again Jesus walked into the synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there. __They__ watched __him__ to see if __he__ would heal __him__ on the Sabbath.** (Mark 3:1-2) \\ 
It is not clear to whom the pronouns "they," "he" and "him" refer. \\ 

**Certain men came down from Judea and taught __the brothers__, saying, "Unless __you__ are circumcised after the custom of Moses, __you__ cannot be saved." When Paul and Barnabas had a confrontation and debate with them,** (Acts 15:1-2) \\ 
The two groups of people are kept separate by putting one inside a direct quotation so that you plural can be used for one group. \\ 

The pronoun precedes what it refers to. \\
**By __this__ we know that we know him, if __we keep his commandments__.** (1 John 2:3) \\ 
**__Who__ is the liar but __he__ who denies that Jesus is the Christ?** (1 John 2:22)



===== Translation Strategies =====
  - Study how your language uses pronouns and use them in the same way. 
  -  If there are two people or things or two groups of people or things make sure that your translation makes it clear which one is being referred to.


===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
1. Study how your language uses pronouns and use them in the same way. \\ 
In English, the pronoun usually follows the noun it refers to.\\ 
** Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?** (1 John 2:22) \\ 
The person who denies that Jesus in the Christ is the real liar! \\ 
In English, in a new chapter a noun phrase, not a pronoun, must be used the first time a person is referred to.\\  
**They watched him to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.** (Mark 3:2)\\ 
This is the beginning of a new chapter and there is no noun to tell who the “they” refers to. 
Some men of the Pharisee sect watched him carefully in order to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath (UDB) The “they” is explained. \\

2. If there are two people or things or two groups of people or things make sure that your translation makes it clear which one is being referred to. \\  
**They watched him to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.** (Mark 3:2) \\  
There are two “he/him” pronouns referring to two different people. It is not clear who is being spoken of. \\ 
Some men of the Pharisee sect watched him carefully in order to see whether he would __heal the man__ on the Sabbath (UDB) One of the “he” has been replaced by “the man.”
