\v 15 They show that they know in their own minds what God commands in his Law, for each person in his very own conscience either accuses himself of bad behavior or defends himself.
\v 16 God will punish them at the time when he will judge people according to what they have thought and done. He will judge them even for the things that they have done secretly. He will judge people by  authorizing Christ Jesus  to judge them. This is  what I tell people when I preach the good news to them.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **By this they show...**  - These verses should be broken down into several sentences (see UDB).
    * **By this**  - Paul shows that God may punish them (vv. 15-16) because of the awareness they already have of God's will (shown in vv. 13-14).
    * **- on the day when**  - Paul now picks up from where he left off at the end of v. 13 - "the doers of the Law who will be justified" (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:grammar:ellipsis|Ellipsis]])
