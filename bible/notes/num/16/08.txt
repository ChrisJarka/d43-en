\v 8 And Moses said to Korah, Hear now, you sons of Levi:
\v 9 seems it but a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;
\v 10 and that he has brought you near, and all your brethren the sons of Levi with you? and seek you the priesthood also?
\v 11 Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Jehovah: and Aaron, what is he that you murmur against him?
