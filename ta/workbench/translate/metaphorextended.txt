==== Description ====

An extended metaphor occurs when someone speaks of a situation as if it were a different situation. He does this in order to effectively describe the first situation by implying that in some important way it is similar to the other. The second situation has multiple **images** of people, things, and actions that represent those in the first situation. 
 
=== Reasons this is a translation issue  ===
  * People may not realize that the images represent other things.
  * People may not be familiar with the things that are used as images. 
  * Such extended metaphors are often so profound that a translator would find it impossible to signify all of the meaning generated by the metaphor.

=== Translation Principles  ===
  * Make the meaning of the extended metaphor as clear to the target audience as it was to the original audience.
  * Do not make the meaning more clear to the target audience than it was to the original audience.
  * When someone uses an extended metaphor, the images are an important part of what he is trying to say.
  * If the target audience is not familiar with some of the images, you will need to find some way of helping them understand the images so they can understand the whole extended metaphor.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

Psalm 23 has an extended metaphor showing how God cares for his people as a shepherd cares for his sheep. Shepherds give sheep what they need, take them to safe places, rescue them, guide them, and protect them. These are things that God does for his people.

><sup>1</sup>Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing.
><sup>2</sup>He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
>he leads me beside tranquil water.
><sup>3</sup>He brings back my life;
>he guides me along right paths for his name's sake.
><sup>4</sup>Even though I walk through a valley of darkest shadow,
>I will not fear harm since you are with me;
>your rod and your staff comfort me. (Psalm 23:1-4 ULB)

Isaiah 5 has a metaphor showing how God cared for his people and expected them to do good things, just as a farmer cares for his vineyard and expects it to produce good fruit.

><sup>1</sup>...My well beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
><sup>2</sup>He spaded it and removed the stones, and planted it with the choicest vine.
>He built a tower in the middle of it, and also built a winepress.
>He waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced wild grapes. 

><sup>3</sup>So now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah;
>judge between me and my vineyard.
><sup>4</sup>What more could have been done for my vineyard, that I have not done for it?
>When I looked for it to produce grapes, why did it produce wild grapes?
><sup>5</sup> Now I will inform you what I will do to my vineyard; I will remove the hedge;
>I will turn it into a pasture; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled on.
><sup>6</sup>I will lay it waste, and it will not be pruned nor hoed. But briers and thorns will spring up,
> I will also command the clouds not to rain on it.

><sup>7</sup>For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel,
>and the men of Judah his pleasant planting;
>he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing;
>for righteousness, but, instead, a cry for help. (Isaiah 5:1-2 ULB)

==== Translation Strategies ====
If people would understand the metaphor in the same way that the original readers would have understood it, consider using it. If not, here are some other strategies.

  - If the target audience would think that the images should be understood literally, change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding "like" or "as."
  - If the target audience would not know the **image,** find a way of translating it so they can understand what it is.
<del>  - If the target audience would not know the **image**, see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] for ideas on how to translate that image.
  - If the target audience would not use that **image** for that meaning use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times.</del> 


==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. If the target audience would think that the images should be understood literally, change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding "like" or "as." It may be enough to use "like" or "as" in just the first sentence. The example below uses it in every verse.

><sup>1</sup>Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing.
><sup>2</sup>He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
>he leads me beside tranquil water.
><sup>3</sup>He brings back my life;
>he guides me along right paths for his name's sake.
><sup>4</sup>Even though I walk through a valley of darkest shadow,
>I will not fear harm since you are with me;
>your rod and your staff comfort me. (Psalm 23:1-4 ULB)

  * <sup>1</sup>Yahweh cares for me __as__ a shepherd cares for his sheep, so I will lack nothing. 
  * <sup>2</sup>__Like__ a shepherd who makes his sheep lie down in green pastures and leads them by peaceful waters, 
  * he helps me to rest peacefully. 
  * <sup>3</sup>__Like__ a good shepherd, he brings back my life;
  * and he guides me along right paths for his name's sake.
  * <sup>4</sup>Even though I go through danger __like__ a sheep walking through a dangerous valley,
  * I will not fear harm since you are with me;
  * __As__ a shepherd guides and protects his sheep with his rod and staff,
  * you guide and protect me, and I am comforted."

2. If the target audience would not know the **image,** find a way of translating it so they can understand what it is.

><sup>1</sup>...My well beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
><sup>2</sup>He spaded it and removed the stones, and planted it with the choicest vine.
>He built a tower in the middle of it, and also built a winepress.
>He waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced wild grapes. 

><sup>3</sup>So now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah;
>judge between me and my vineyard.
><sup>4</sup>What more could have been done for my vineyard, that I have not done for it?
>When I looked for it to produce grapes, why did it produce wild grapes?
><sup>5</sup> Now I will inform you what I will do to my vineyard; I will remove the hedge;
>I will turn it into a pasture; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled on.
><sup>6</sup>I will lay it waste, and it will not be pruned nor hoed. But briers and thorns will spring up,
> I will also command the clouds not to rain on it.

><sup>7</sup>For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel,
>and the men of Judah his pleasant planting;
>he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing;
>for righteousness, but, instead, a cry for help. (Isaiah 5:1-2 ULB)

  * "<sup>1</sup>...My well beloved had a __grapevine garden__ on a very fertile hill.
  * <sup>2</sup>He spaded it and removed the stones, and planted it with __the best grapevines__.
  * He built a __watchtower__ in the middle of it, and also built __a tank where he could crush the juice out of the wine__.
  * He waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced __wild grapes that were not good for making wine__. 

  * <sup>3</sup>__My beloved says this:__ So now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah;
  * judge between me and __my grapevine garden__.
  * <sup>4</sup>What more could have been done for __my grapevine garden__, that I have not done for it?
  * When I looked for it to produce __good grapes__, why did it produce wild grapes?
  * <sup>5</sup> Now I will inform you what I will do to my vineyard; I will remove the hedge __that protects it from anyone that might go in and ruin it__;
  * I will turn it into __a wild pasture for animals to eat there__; I will break down __the wall that keeps animals out__, and __animals will trample on it__.
  * <sup>6</sup>I will lay it waste, and it will not be pruned nor hoed. But briers and thorns will spring up,
  *  I will also command the clouds not to rain on it.

  * <sup>7</sup>For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is __the nation of Israel__, 
  * and the men of Judah are __the garden that he was pleased to plant__;
  * he waited for __them to do what is just__, but instead, __they murdered people__;
  * He waited for them __to do what is right__, but, instead, he heard cries for help from the people they were attacking. 
  * __So as a farmer stops caring for a grapevine garden that produces bad fruit, Yahweh will stop protecting Israel and Judah.__"
