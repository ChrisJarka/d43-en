===== Before Translating =====

Before you start translating, there are a number of items that will be helpful to know.

Translation of all unfoldingWord projects is done by volunteers who desire to see God's Word made available for everyone. Everyone who works on these projects must agree with and do their work in accordance with the three documents:

  * [[:en:ta:before:statement_of_faith|Statement of Faith]]
  * [[:en:ta:before:translation_guidelines|Translation Guidelines]]
  * [[:en:ta:before:license|Open License]]

All three of these must be followed without exception so please read them carefully.

There is also a [[:en:ta:before:glossary|glossary]] of key terms, a list of [[:en:ta:before:projects|projects]] currently underway. Before you begin translating, it is helpful to know [[:en:ta:before:content|what needs to be translated]] and [[:en:ta:before:where|where to translate it]]. You might also find it helpful to know [[:en:ta:before:update|how to update]] a translation to the latest version or make sure it is the latest version before you get started.

Once you start translating, you will want to learn [[:en:ta:translate|how to translate]].

Then you will want to know [[:en:ta:check|how to check]] your translation.

When you are done translating and checking you will then want to know [[:en:ta:after|what to do when the translation is completed]].
