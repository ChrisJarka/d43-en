\c 26
\q
\v 1 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,
\q So honor is not seemly for a fool.
\q
\v 2 As the sparrow in her wandering, as the swallow in her flying,
\q So the curse that is causeless alighteth not.
\q
\v 3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass,
\q And a rod for the back of fools.
\q
\v 4 Answer not a fool according to his folly,
\q Lest you also be like to him.
\q
\v 5 Answer a fool according to his folly,
\q Lest he be wise in his own conceit.
\q
\v 6 He that sends a message by the hand of a fool
\q Cutteth off his own feet, and drinks in damage.
\q
\v 7 The legs of the lame hang loose;
\q So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
\q
\v 8 As one that bindeth a stone in a sling,
\q So is he that gives honor to a fool.
\q
\v 9 As a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard,
\q So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
\q
\v 10 As an archer that woundeth all,
\q So is he that hireth a fool and he that hireth them that pass by.
\q
\v 11 As a dog that returns to his vomit,
\q So is a fool that repeateth his folly.
\q
\v 12 Seest you a man wise in his own conceit?
\q There is more hope of a fool than of him.
\q
\v 13 The sluggard saith, There is a lion in the way;
\q A lion is in the streets.
\q
\v 14 As the door turns upon its hinges,
\q So does the sluggard upon his bed.
\q
\v 15 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
\q It wearieth him to bring it again to his mouth.
\q
\v 16 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit
\q Than seven men that can render a reason.
\q
\v 17 He that passes by, and vexeth himself with strife belonging not to him,
\q Is like one that takes a dog by the ears.
\q
\v 18 As a madman who throws firebrands,
\q Arrows, and death,
\q
\v 19 So is the man that deceiveth his neighbor,
\q And saith, Am not I in sport?
\q
\v 20 For lack of wood the fire goes out;
\q And where there is no whisperer, contention ceaseth.
\q
\v 21 As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire,
\q So is a contentious man to inflame strife.
\q
\v 22 The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,
\q And they go down into the innermost parts.
\q
\v 23 Fervent lips and a wicked heart
\q Are like an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross.
\q
\v 24 He that hates dissembleth with his lips;
\q But he lays up deceit within him:
\q
\v 25 When he speaks fair, believe him not;
\q For there are seven abominations in his heart:
\q
\v 26 Though his hatred cover itself with guile,
\q His wickedness shall be openly showed before the assembly.
\q
\v 27 Whoso digs a pit shall fall therein;
\q And he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him.
\q
\v 28 A lying tongue hates those whom it has wounded;
\q And a flattering mouth works ruin.
