\v 1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
\q
\v 2 If one assay to commune with thee, will you be grieved?
\q But who can withhold himself from speaking?
\q
\v 3 Behold, you have instructed many,
\q And you have strengthened the weak hands.
\q
\v 4 Your words have upholden him that was falling,
\q And you have made firm the feeble knees.
\q
\v 5 But now it is come to thee, and you faintest;
\q It touches thee, and you are troubled.
\q
\v 6 Is not your fear of God your confidence,
\q And the integrity of your ways your hope?
\q
\v 7 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?
\q Or where were the upright cut off?
\q
\v 8 According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,
\q And sow trouble, reap the same.
\q
\v 9 By the breath of God they perish,
\q And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.
\q
\v 10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,
\q And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
\q
\v 11 The old lion perishes for lack of prey,
\q And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.
\b
\q
\v 12 Now a thing was secretly brought to me,
\q And mine ear received a whisper thereof.
\q
\v 13 In thoughts from the visions of the night,
\q When deep sleep falls on men,
\q
\v 14 Fear came upon me, and trembling,
\q Which made all my bones to shake.
\q
\v 15 Then a spirit passed before my face;
\q The hair of my flesh stood up.
\q
\v 16 It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof;
\q A form was before mine eyes:
\q There was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
\q
\v 17 Shall mortal man be more just than God?
\q Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
\q
\v 18 Behold, he puts no trust in his servants;
\q And his angels he chargeth with folly:
\q
\v 19 How much more them that dwell in houses of clay,
\q Whose foundation is in the dust,
\q Who are crushed before the moth!
\q
\v 20 Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed:
\q They perish for ever without any regarding it.
\q
\v 21 Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them?
\q They die, and that without wisdom.
