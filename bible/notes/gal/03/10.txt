\v 10 That is, God will eternally punish all those who \add mistakenly\add* think \add that God will erase the record of their sins\add* as a result of their\add obeying\add* the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add*. What is written in the Scriptures is that \add God\add* will eternally punish everyone who does not continuously and completely obey all the laws \add that Moses wrote\add*.
\v 11 But God has declared that if he erases the record of anyone's sins, it will not be as a result of their obeying the laws God gave Moses. \add This is evident because the Scriptures say\add*, "Every person whose record of sins God erases because that person trusts God will live \add spiritually\add*."
\v 12 But \add when God gave\add* his laws \add to the Jews, he did\add* not \add say that a person must\add* trust \add him\add*. Instead \add God said that\add* it is those who obey \add all God's laws, continuously and completely\add*, who will live.

\v 10 All those who think they can please God by obeying his law--God curses them all. It is just as the scriptures said long ago, "God will eternally punish everyone who does not continuously and completely obey all the laws that Moses wrote in the Book of the Law."
\v 11 But God has declared that if he considers any people good in his sight, it will not be because they obeyed his law. This is evident because the Scriptures say, "Every person who is good in God's sight will live because he trusts God."
\v 12 Whoever tries to obey the law is not trusting in Christ. Instead, the scriptures say, "Whoever starts to do the things in the law must obey them all."

\v 10 Those who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things written in the book of the law, to do it all."
\v 11 Now it is clear that God justifies no one by the law, for, "The righteous will live by faith."
\v 12 The law is not from faith, but instead, "He who does these things in the law will live by the laws."
