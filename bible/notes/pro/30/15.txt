\q
\v 15 The horseleach has two daughters, crying, Give, give.
\q There are three things that are never satisfied,
\q Yea, four that say not, Enough:
\q
\v 16 Sheol; and the barren womb;
\q The earth that is not satisfied with water;
\q And the fire that says not, Enough.
\q
\v 17 The eye that mocketh at his father,
\q And despises to obey his mother,
\q The ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
\q And the young eagles shall eat it.
\b
