\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the band called the Italian
band,
\v 2 a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always.
\v 3 He saw in a vision openly, as it were about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to
him, Cornelius.
\v 4 And he, fastening his eyes upon him, and being affrighted, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and
your alms are gone up for a memorial before God.
\v 5 And now send men to Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter:
\v 6 he lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side.
\v 7 And when the angel that spoke to him was departed, he called two of his household-servants, and a devout soldier of them
that waited on him continually;
\v 8 and having rehearsed all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.
\p
\v 9 Now on the morrow, as they were on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray,
about the sixth hour:
\v 10 and he became hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance;
\v 11 and he sees the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four corners
upon the earth:
\v 12 wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven.
\v 13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.
\v 14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean.
\v 15 And a voice came to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, make not you common.
\v 16 And this was done thrice: and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven.
\p
\v 17 Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were
sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon’s house, stood before the gate,
\v 18 and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, were lodging there.
\v 19 And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee.
\v 20 But arise, and get you down, and go with them, nothing doubting: for I have sent them.
\v 21 And Peter went down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek: what is the cause wherefore you are come?
\v 22 And they said, Cornelius a centurion, a righteous man and one that fears God, and well reported of by all the nation of
the Jews, was warned of God by a holy angel to send for you into his house, and to hear words from you.
\v 23 So he called them in and lodged them.
\p And on the morrow he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
\v 24 And on the morrow they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and
his near friends.
\v 25 And when it came to pass that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.
\v 26 But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
\v 27 And as he talked with him, he went in, and finds many come together:
\v 28 and he said to them, You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to join himself or come
to one of another nation; and yet to me has God showed that I should not call any man common or unclean:
\v 29 wherefore also I came without gainsaying, when I was sent for. I ask therefore with what intent you sent for me.
\v 30 And Cornelius said, Four days ago, until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, a man
stood before me in bright apparel,
\v 31 and saith, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
\v 32 Send therefore to Joppa, and call to you Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by
the sea side.
\v 33 Forthwith therefore I sent to thee; and you have well done that you are come. Now therefore we are all here present in
the sight of God, to hear all things that have been commanded you of the Lord.
\v 34 And Peter opened his mouth, and said,
\p Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
\v 35 but in every nation he that fears him, and works righteousness, is acceptable to him.
\v 36 The word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all)—
\v 37 that saying you yourselves know, which was published throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which
John preached;
\v 38 even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good,
and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
\v 39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they slew,
hanging him on a tree.
\v 40 Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,
\v 41 not to all the people, but to witnesses that were chosen before of God,
even to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
\v 42 And he charged us to preach to the people, and to testify that this is he who is ordained of God
to be the Judge of the living and the dead.
\v 43 To him bear all the prophets witness, that through his name every one that believes on him shall receive remission of
sins.
\p
\v 44 While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word.
\v 45 And they of the circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was
poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\v 46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,
\v 47 Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?
\v 48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then prayed they him to wait certain days.
