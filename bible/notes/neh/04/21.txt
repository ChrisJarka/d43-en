\v 21 So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
\v 22 Likewise at the same time said I to the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the
night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.
\v 23 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our
clothes, every one went with his weapon to the water.
