\v 5 So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
\v 6 And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that you die not, and that he be not angry with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah has kindled.
\v 7 And you shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
