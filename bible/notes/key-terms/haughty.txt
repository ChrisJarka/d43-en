====== haughty ======

===== Definition: =====

To be haughty typically means to have excessive pride, a pride that is not shown to be true by the facts. For example, if a consistently successful farmer says "I'm a good farmer," he is not being haughty, but truthful and accurate. His statement is shown to be true by the results. A haughty person claims to have success which is not shown by results.

  * In addition to referring to the whole person, someone can have haughty eyes, mind, face, heart, neck, speech, or spirit.
