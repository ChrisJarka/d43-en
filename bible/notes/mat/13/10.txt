\v 10 The disciples came and said to Jesus, "Why do you talk to the crowd in parables?"
\v 11 Jesus answered and said to them, "You have been given the privilege of understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it 
is not given.
\v 12 Because whoever has, to him will be given more, and he will have a great deal. But whoever has not, from him will be taken 
away even what he has.

  * **You have been given the privilege of understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given**  - This can be translated with active verbs and the implied information is that God is the giver: “God has given you the privilege of understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but God has not given it to these people” or “God has made you able to understand mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but he has not given it to them.” (See: Active or Passive and Explicit and Implicit Information)
