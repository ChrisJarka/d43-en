\v 25 Have you not heard how I, Yahweh, 
\q2 have determined it long ago, 
\q From ancient times I formed 
\q2 what I now bring to pass, 
\q that you should lay waste to fortified cities 
\q2 into ruinous heaps.
\q 
\v 26 Therefore their inhabitants were emptied of power.
\q2 They were dismayed and confounded. 
\q They were as the grass of the field,
\q2 as the tender green sprigs, 
\q like the grass on housetops, 
\q2 burned before it has grown.
