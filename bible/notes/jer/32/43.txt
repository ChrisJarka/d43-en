\v 43 \add By buying land you, Jeremiah, have predicted that some day\add* people will buy and sell fields in this land about which you people of Jerusalem now say, "The Babylonian soldiers have destroyed it. It is now desolate. It is a land where there are no longer any people or animals."
\v 44 \add But some day\add* people will again buy and sell fields here. People will sign documents \add about buying those fields\add*, and other people will witness them doing that. That will happen in the land where \add the descendants of\add* Benjamin live and here in the villages near Jerusalem, in other towns in Judah, in the hilly areas and in the foothills \add to the west\add*, and in the southern desert area, too. Some day I will cause them to prosper again. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.'~"

\v 43 And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof you say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\v 44 Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, says Jehovah.
