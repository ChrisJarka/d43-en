\v 5 Behold you among the nations, and look, and wonder marvellously; for I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it be told you.
\v 6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.
\v 7 They are terrible and dreadful; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.
