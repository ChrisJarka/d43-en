Please read the information on [[en:ta:vol1:process:publishing_process]] before publishing your work.

==== Publishing in tS-Android  ====

When you publish your work there are several steps to the process. See [[https://unfoldingword.org/academy/ta-process.html#vol1_process_intro_publishing]] for more information.

The process in translationStudio begins when you select **Upload** from the 3 dot icon menu. This uploads the translation to the Door43 cloud server. 

The process continues when you submit the **Request to Publish** form for your translation to appear in unfoldingWord web and applications. 

The Request to Publish form includes several pieces of data such as your contact information, the requested checking level, translation contributors, etc. The person who reviews the request will verify that each contributor provided a legal signature.

Complete the following steps to publish your work:

=== Upload your work ===

In translationStudio, tap on the 3-dot icon to access the options menu.
  - Select the **Upload**, the cloud icon.
The 4 steps to upload are displayed at the top of the screen.
  - **Book** - Review sections of the book for final review. Scroll down to the bottom of the list of all the chunks. Tap on the blue **Next Step** button to continue. 
    - We suggest that you review any chunk that has a review button. These are chunks that are not marked done.
    - Tap on the Review button to finish translating, or set the verse markers and then slide the 'done' button.
  - **Translators** - This is where you enter who translated the work. Remember that the names will be publicly available.
    - Tap the pencil to edit the translator's name.
    - Tap the "Add Contributor" to include another translator. The contributor needs to check off that they have read and agree to the 'Statement of Faith', 'License Agreement', and the 'Translation Guidelines.'
    - Tap on the blue **Next Step** button to continue. 
  - **Review** - Green checks on each line confirms the translated work can be submitted for publishing. Tap on the blue **Next Step** button to continue. 
  - **Publish** - There are three choices to self-publish; 
    - Upload the work to UnfoldingWord (requires an Internet connection). There will be a successful message when the upload is complete.
    - Export to the SD card
    - Send to another app.
A pop-up message will appear after a successful upload. This pop-up message includes the repository that the translation is in on the Door43 server. Tap on the link to view the repository.

The translation has been uploaded to the server. At that time the documentation process takes place.

==== Questions Regarding the Request to Publish Form and Process ====

=== What Happens After Text is Approved? ===

When the Request to Publish is approved, the text is made available on unfoldingword.org for online viewing, as a downloadable, print-ready PDF, and it appears in the unfoldingWord app.

=== Can Text Be Changed After Level 3 Checking? ===

Approved text can always be modified in translationStudio even after all checking levels are completed, HOWEVER if you or another user were to submit a Request to Publish for text that has already completed Level 3 checking, there would be questions regarding the reason for overwriting the previously published and checked materials. The approver will look to see who contributed to the change and may contact the requestor and others involved with the translation of the text in question to ensure the changes are valid.

=== Must All Contributors Be Named? ===

Due to copyright laws (and these exist no matter what country you are in and no matter what people tell you about laws in that country), you must list __every__ contributor on the Request to Publish form and provide a legal signature for each person. In certain cases we understand they cannot be named, however you can provide the established pseudonym for that person.
