\v 19 Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped
them not; for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall away to his master Saul to the
jeopardy of our heads.
\v 20 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and
Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands that were of Manasseh.
