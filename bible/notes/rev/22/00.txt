=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter emphasizes that the prophecies of the book of Revelation are going to take place soon. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Tree of life ==
There is probably an intended connection between the tree of life in the Garden of Eden and the tree of life mentioned here. The curse that began in Eden will end at this time. 


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Alpha and omega ==

These are the names of the first and last Greek letters. The ULB does not translate these words into English but chooses to represent them in English using English letters instead. This can serve as a model for other translators.
