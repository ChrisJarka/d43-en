\v 13 The next day, the leaders of the families and the priests and the Levites came together with Ezra to study carefully the laws that Yahweh had given to Moses.
\v 14 While they were doing that, they realized that Yahweh had told Moses to command the Israelite people to live in shelters during that month, \add to remember that their ancestors lived in shelters when they left Egypt\add*.
\v 15 They also learned that they should proclaim in Jerusalem and in all the towns that the people should go to the hills and cut branches from olive trees \add that they have planted\add* and from wild olive trees and from myrtle trees and palm trees and fig trees. They should make shelters from these branches, and live in those shelters during the festival, just as Moses wrote \add that they should do\add*.

\v 13 And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathersâ€™
houses of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of
the law.
\v 14 And they found written in the law, how that Jehovah had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in
booths in the feast of the seventh month;
\v 15 and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and
fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make
booths, as it is written.
