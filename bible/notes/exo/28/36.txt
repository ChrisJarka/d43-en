\v 36 You must make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, like the engraving on a signet, HOLY, RESERVED IN HONOR OF YAHWEH.
\v 37 You must attach to the front of the turban a blue cord.
\v 38 It must be on Aaronâ€™s forehead, and Aaron must always bear any guilt that might attach to the offering of the holy gifts that the Israelites will set apart for Yahweh, regardless of what those gifts are.
