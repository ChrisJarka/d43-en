\v 13 And Yahweh’s anger was kindled against Israel. He made them wander to and fro in the wilderness for forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of Yahweh was consumed.
\v 14 “Behold, you are risen up in your fathers’ place, an increase of sinful men, to add to the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel.
