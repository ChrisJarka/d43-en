\c 62
\d For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 My soul waits in silence for God only:
\q From him comes my salvation.
\q
\v 2 He only is my rock and my salvation:
\q He is my high tower; I shall not be greatly moved.
\q
\v 3 How long will you set upon a man,
\q That you may kill him, all of you,
\q Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
\q
\v 4 They only consult to thrust him down from his dignity;
\q They delight in lies;
\q They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 My soul, wait you in silence for God only;
\q For my expectation is from him.
\q
\v 6 He only is my rock and my salvation:
\q He is my high tower; I shall not be moved.
\q
\v 7 With God is my salvation and my glory:
\q The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
\q
\v 8 Trust in him at all times, you people;
\q Pour out your heart before him:
\q God is a refuge for us. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie:
\q In the balances they will go up;
\q They are together lighter than vanity.
\q
\v 10 Trust not in oppression,
\q And become not vain in robbery:
\q If riches increase, set not your heart thereon.
\q
\v 11 God has spoken once,
\q Twice have I heard this,
\q That power belongs to God.
\q
\v 12 Also to thee, O Lord, belongs lovingkindness;
\q For you renderest to every man according to his work.
