\v 11 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life: how
much more may this Benjamite now do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah has commanded him.
\v 12 It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done to me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for
his cursing of me this day.
