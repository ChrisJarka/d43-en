\b
\q1
\v 17 \add We people of\add* \f + \ft personification \f* Jerusalem reach out our hands \add to get help\add*,

\q
\v 16 For these things I weep, my eyes overflow with tears;
\q for a comforter is far from me, one who restores my life.
\q My children are desolate because the enemy has conquered me.
\q
\v 17 Zion has spread her hands wide; there is none to comfort her.
\q Yahweh has commanded that those around Jacob should be his adversaries.
\q Jerusalem is something unclean to them.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In this section Jerusalem is described as a woman speaking about herself. In Lamentations, Zion and Jerusalem are names used to refer to the same city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

  * **for a comforter is far from me, one who restores my life** - This speaks of Jerusalem having no one to comfort her as if she did have a comforter, but that he was far away. The word "comforter" can be expressed as a verb. AT: "for there is no one to comfort me and restore my life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **restores my life** - "revives me"
  * **Zion has spread her hands wide** - Here Jerusalem no longer speaks herself, but the author describes Jerusalem. He speaks of Zion as if it were a woman that lifts up her hands to ask for help. AT: "Zion has reached out for help" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **those around Jacob** - "the people around Jacob" or "the nations surrounding Jacob"
