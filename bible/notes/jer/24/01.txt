\c 24
\p
\v 1 Jehovah showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and
smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
\v 2 One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not
be eaten, they were so bad.
\v 3 Then said Jehovah to me, What see thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad,
that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
