====== 1 Kings 21 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The story of Elijah continues. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

God hates oppression but is forgiving to people who are sorry for their sins. Ahab wanted Naboth's vinyard to make into a garden for his palace; but Naboth refused to sell it. So the queen, Ahab's wife told the civic leaders of Naboth's town to falsely accuse him and execute him. But Elijah told him that he would be killed in Naboth's vinyard and all his family destroyed. Ahab repented and showed he was very sorry for what he did so God said it would not happen to Ahab himself but to his son.
