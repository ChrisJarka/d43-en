\v 4 And I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales; and I will bring you
up out of the midst of your rivers, with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales.
\v 5 And I will cast you forth into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers: you shall fall upon the open field;
you shall not be brought together, nor gathered; I have given you for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the
heavens.
