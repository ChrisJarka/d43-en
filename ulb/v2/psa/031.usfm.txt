\c 31
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge;
\q Let me never be put to shame:
\q Deliver me in your righteousness.
\q
\v 2 Bow down your ear to me; deliver me speedily:
\q Be you to me a strong rock,
\q A house of defence to save me.
\q
\v 3 For you are my rock and my fortress;
\q Therefore for your nameâ€™s sake lead me and guide me.
\q
\v 4 Pluck me out of the net that they have laid privily for me;
\q For you are my stronghold.
\q
\v 5 Into your hand I commend my spirit:
\q You have redeemed me, O Jehovah, you God of truth.
\q
\v 6 I hate them that regard lying vanities;
\q But I trust in Jehovah.
\q
\v 7 I will be glad and rejoice in your lovingkindness;
\q For you have seen my affliction:
\q You have known my soul in adversities;
\q
\v 8 And you have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy;
\q You have set my feet in a large place.
\q
\v 9 Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am in distress:
\q Mine eye wastes away with grief, yea, my soul and my body.
\q
\v 10 For my life is spent with sorrow,
\q And my years with sighing:
\q My strength fails because of mine iniquity,
\q And my bones are wasted away.
\q
\v 11 Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach,
\q Yea, to my neighbors exceedingly,
\q And a fear to mine acquaintance:
\q They that did see me without fled from me.
\q
\v 12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind:
\q I am like a broken vessel.
\q
\v 13 For I have heard the defaming of many,
\q Terror on every side:
\q While they took counsel together against me,
\q They devised to take away my life.
\q
\v 14 But I trusted in thee, O Jehovah:
\q I said, You are my God.
\q
\v 15 My times are in your hand:
\q Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
\q
\v 16 Make your face to shine upon your servant:
\q Save me in your lovingkindness.
\q
\v 17 Let me not be put to shame, O Jehovah; for I have called upon thee:
\q Let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent in Sheol.
\q
\v 18 Let the lying lips be dumb,
\q Which speak against the righteous insolently,
\q With pride and contempt.
\q
\v 19 Oh how great is your goodness,
\q Which you have laid up for them that fear thee,
\q Which you have wrought for them that take refuge in thee,
\q Before the sons of men!
\q
\v 20 In the covert of your presence will you hide them from the plottings of man:
\q You will keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
\q
\v 21 Blessed be Jehovah;
\q For he has showed me his marvelous lovingkindness in a strong city.
\q
\v 22 As for me, I said in my haste,
\q I am cut off from before your eyes:
\q Nevertheless you heard the voice of my supplications,
\q When I cried to thee.
\q
\v 23 Oh love Jehovah, all you his saints:
\q Jehovah preserves the faithful,
\q And plentifully rewardeth him that deals proudly.
\q
\v 24 Be strong, and let your heart take courage,
\q All you that hope in Jehovah.
