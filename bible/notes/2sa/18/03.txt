\v 3 But his soldiers said, "No, we will not allow you to go with us. If they force us to all run away, they will not be concerned about that. Or if they kill half of us, they will also not be what they want. To them, \add capturing\add* you is more important than \add capturing\add* ten thousand of us. So it will be better that you \add stay here\add* in the city and send help to us."
\p
\v 4 The king replied to them, "Okay, I will do whatever seems best to you." So he stood at the gate \add and watched\add* while his soldiers marched out, group by group.

\v 3 But the people said, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die,
will they care for us: but you are worth ten yousand of us; therefore now it is better that you be ready to succor us out of
the city.
\v 4 And the king said to them, What seems you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went
out by hundreds and by thousands.
