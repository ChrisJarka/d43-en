\v 1 That evening, the two angels arrived in Sodom. Lot was sitting at the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to greet them, and prostrated himself with his face on the ground.
\v 2 He said to them, "Gentlemen, please stay in my house tonight. You can wash your feet, and tomorrow you can continue your journey." But they said, "No, we will just sleep in the city square."
\v 3 But Lot kept insisting strongly that they sleep in his house. So they entered his house with him, and he prepared a meal for them. He baked some bread without yeast, and they ate it.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, while Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, arose to meet them, and bowed down with his face to the ground.
\v 2 He said, "Please my lords, I urge you to turn aside into your servant’s house, stay for the night, and wash your feet. Then you can rise up early and go on your way." And they said, "No, we will spend the night in the town square."
\v 3 But he urged them strongly, so they went with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
