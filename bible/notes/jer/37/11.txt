\v 11 When the army from Babylonia left Jerusalem because the army from Egypt was approaching,

\v 13 But as I was walking out the Benjamin Gate, a guard seized me and said, "You are deserting \add us and going\add* to \add the soldiers from\add* Babylonia!" The man who seized me was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah and grandson of Hananiah.

\v 11 And it came to pass that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaohâ€™s army,
\v 12 then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of
the people.
\v 13 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah,
the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You are falling away to the Chaldeans.
