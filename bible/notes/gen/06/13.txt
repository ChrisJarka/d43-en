===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **all flesh **- refers primarily to human beings.
  * **cypress wood**  - The exact tree of type is unknown, so use a tree type like cypress that would be good for making a boat or sea-worthy vessel.
  * **pitch**  - This is a sticky resin or oily substance that waterproofs the boat.
  * **tar**  - a sticky oily substance that oozes from the ground in some places; also pitch that is thickened through boiling
  * **contemporary measurements as editorial inserts - **  three hundred cubits //[editor: equal to 138 meters] //  (would allow the translator to insert their own local measurements in place of the metric)
  * **make for yourself a boat** - boat (Hebrew, "TBT") can be translated "ark" or "large box". What makes it a "boat" is that it is constructed to float and survive on the open water in heavy weather and for a significant time.
