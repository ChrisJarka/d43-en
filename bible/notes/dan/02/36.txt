\v 36 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
\v 37 Thou, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the
glory;
\v 38 and wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens has he given into your
hand, and has made you to rule over them all: you are the head of gold.
