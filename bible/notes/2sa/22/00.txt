== Metaphor ==
David uses many [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]s to express God's protection of him: "my rock, my fortress, my shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge." Others he used to express the hopelessness:  the waves of death surrounded me, the rushing waters of worthlessness overwhelmed me, the cords of sheol surrounded me; the snares of death trapped me, the surging water. " And he used some metaphors for the victory God gave him: " I can run over a barricade; by my God I can leap over a wall"
