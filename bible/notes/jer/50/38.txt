\v 39 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it
shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be lived in from generation to generation.
\v 40 As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, says Jehovah, so shall no man dwell there,
neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.
