\v 23 While they were talking with Joseph, they were speaking to an interpreter\f + \ft Or: someone who knew their language and the Egyptian language \f*, but when they said these things among themselves, they were speaking in their own language, and they did not know that Joseph could understand their language, and that he could understand what they were saying.

\v 23 They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them.
\v 24 He turned from them and wept. He returned to them and spoke to them. He took Simeon from among them and bound him before their eyes.
\v 25 Then Joseph commanded his servants to fill his brothers’ bags with grain, and to put every man’s money back into his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. It was done for them.

  * **bound him before their eyes** - Here "eyes" refers to their sight. Alternate translation: "bound him in their sight" or "bound him as they watched." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
