\v 22 Although God desires to show that he is angry about sin, and although he desires to make clear that he can powerfully punish people who have sinned, he tolerated very patiently the people who caused him to be angry and who deserved to be destroyed.
\v 23 God has been patient in order that he might make clear how very wonderfully he acts toward those upon whom he has mercy, whom he prepared ahead of time in order that they might live with him.
\v 24 That means us whom he chose—not only us Jews, but also non-Jews.

\v 22 What if God, who is willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience containers of wrath prepared for destruction,
\v 23 in order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon containers of mercy, which he previously prepared for glory
\v 24 —also us, whom he also called, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the Gentiles?
