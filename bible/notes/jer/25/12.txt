\v 12 Then it will happen when seventy years have been completed, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans—this is Yahweh's declaration—for their iniquity and make it an unending desolation.
\v 13 Then I will carry out against that land all the words that I had spoken, and everything written in this book that Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
\v 14 For also many other nations and great kings will make slaves out of these nations. I will repay them for their deeds and the works of their hands.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **when seventy years have been completed** - "after seventy years" or "after seventy years have passed"
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **an unending desolation** - The noun "desolation" can be translated as an adjective. AT: "desolate forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **everything written in this book** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "everything that Jeremiah has written in this book" or "everything that one has written in this book" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I will repay them for their deeds and the works of their hands** - Yahweh speaks of punishing the people of the nations for what they have done as if he were paying them back. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their deeds and the works of their hands** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The idiom "the works of their hands" refers to the actions of a person, with the word "hands" being a synecdoche that represents the person who does those actions. AT: "everything that they have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
