====== Ecclesiastes 05:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Do not let the things that you promise to do cause you to sin by not doing them. And \add when you promise God to do something and do not do it\add*, do not say to God's priest that is was a mistake for you to promise to do that. If you do that, God will certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* become very angry with you, and he will take from you everything that you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* have worked to acquire.
\v 7 Promising to do something and not doing it is like \f + \ft simile \f* a dream that has no value; instead, revere God \add by doing what you promised him that you would do\add*.

\v 6 Do not let the things that you promise to do cause you to sin by not doing them. And when you promise God to do something and do not do it, do not say to God's priest that it was a mistake for you to promise to do that. If you do that, God can destroy everything you do.
\v 7 Promising to do something and not doing it is like a dream that has no value; instead, revere God by doing what you promised him that you would do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Do not give your mouth a chance to cause your flesh to sin; do not say before the messenger, "that was an error": why should
God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?
\v 7 For in the multitude of dreams, and in many words there is vapor: but fear God.
