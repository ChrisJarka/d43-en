===== How to Translate Open Bible Stories =====

A basic translation process for Open Bible Stories is explained here. Note: the recommendations of the [[http://www.forum-intl.org/resources|Forum of Bible Agencies]] is a helpful reference in the translation of any theological text.

==== Translating the Text ====

As you translate Open Bible Stories, be sure that you: 
  * pray that God would help you make an easily-understandable, Scripturally-accurate translation
  * translate everything that is in the source language
  * don't add anything that that is not necessary for comprehension
  * always do your translation according to the [[en:translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines]]
  * always do your translation according to the [[en:statement-of-faith|Statement of Faith]]
  * use the [[en:obs:notes|Translation Notes]] to help you make a better translation

==== Where To Start Translating ====

You can work your way through the Stories however you want, but we have found [[en:obs:31|Story #31]] is a good first story to translate since it is short and easy to understand. 

==== Translate from the Source Language ====

''Note: "Source Language" refers to the language from which the translation is being done. "Target Language" refers to the language into which the translation is being done.''

When the target language is [[https://door43.org/obs-setup|set up]] on Door43, the source language can be chosen from a list of approved source languages. After it has been set up, the page for the target language will be populated with Open Bible Stories from the source language. The translator can then translate from the source language into the target language and then delete the source language when translation is completed.

=== Translation Notes & Important Terms ===

To help translators make the best translation possible, [[:en:obs:notes|Translation Notes]] and [[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:home|Important Terms]] have been created. 

Translation Notes are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain the context in which the stories from Open Bible Stories was written as well as inform the translator of translation options available to them. 

The Important Terms are key terms found in Open Bible Stories that are very crucial that they be translated correctly. Each Important Term has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places that term is used in Open Bible Stories to ensure that it has been translated correctly there, too.

Once you have consulted the Translation Notes and Important Terms, then you are ready to make the best translation. 

**Please use the Translation Notes & Important Terms when doing your translation!**

    * There are bold words in the text. These are links to the Important Terms that need to be translated correctly. Click on the green word to go to another page that will give more information on how to translate the very important word.
    * Translation Notes explains how to translate some of the important words in the story. The definition of the word or phrase should help you understand how to translate.
