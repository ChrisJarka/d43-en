===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you** - Jesus was talking to a group of people about what might happen in their individual lives.
  * **commit** - This word means acting out or doing something.
  * **But I say to you that everyone who looks** - Jesus is using a metaphor comparing the acting out of sin with the heart issue that proceeds the action. He says the sin action that people can see starts with thought or feelings of the heart that cannot be seen. (See TAlink: Metaphor)
  * **looks on a woman to lust** - This means that the sin of adultery is committed when the desire of the heart is sinful even before outward actions are performed.
