\v 24 But he did not let them tell him what he should do \add as the Messiah\add*, because he knew within himself what they were all \add thinking\add*.
\v 25 He did not need anyone to tell him what others were thinking, because he already knew what they were \add thinking and wanting\add*.

\v 23 When Jesus was in Jerusalem during the Passover celebration, many people trusted in him because they saw the miracles that pointed to Jesus.
\v 24 But Jesus knew what people were like. And because he knew them so well he did not trust them.
\v 25 He did not need anyone to tell him what kind of people they were. He knew everything about them.

\p
\v 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, seeing his miraculous signs which he did.
\v 24 But Jesus would not trust himself to them, because he knew all people,
\v 25 and because he did not need that any one should testify concerning mankind, for he himself knew what was in mankind.
