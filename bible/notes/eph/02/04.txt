\v 5 As a result, even when we were \add spiritually\add* dead\f + \ft Or: \add as unable to please God as\add* a corpse \f + \ft metaphor \f* is \f* because we were habitually sinning, he enabled us to receive \add spiritual\add*, Or: \add eternal\add* life because of our relationship with Christ. \add Do not forget this: It is only\add* because God has acted so kindly toward you, in a way that you did not deserve, that you are saved \f + \ft Or:that \add he\add* saved you \f* \add from the guilt of your sin\add*!
\v 6 And \add it is as though\add* God gave us spiritual life when he caused Christ Jesus to be alive again after he died \f + \ft metaphor \f*. And \add it is as though\add* God caused us to sit \add and rule\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* with him in heaven,

\v 4 But God always acts very mercifully, and he loves us very much.
\v 5 We were like dead people, powerless because we disobey God, but then God made us live again by joining us to Christ who lives. By the kindness of God through Christ's forgiveness we are saved from being punished for our sins.
\v 6 God raised us up from those who are "dead" in sinfulness, and he gave us seats of honor to rule with Christ Jesus in heavenly places,.
\v 7 so  that he might show in future times the incredible abundance of his kindess that he has freely given to us who belong to Christ Jesus.

\v 4 But since God is rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us,
\v 5 while we were dead in trespasses, he brought us to new life together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—
\v 6 and raised us up together and made us sit together in the heavenly places with Christ Jesus.
\v 7 He did this so that in the ages to come he might show to us the great riches of his grace by his kindness in Christ Jesus.
