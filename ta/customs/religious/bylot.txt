====== By Lot ======


===== The words "by lot” mean a random choice. =====


Every culture has a way of picking people or items by an unsystematic or casual method.


  * Americans can draw papers out of a bowl or sing a 'counting-out rhymes' such as “eeny, meeny, miny, moe.”
  * Another method is to draw straws which means a collection of small items which are identical except one which is shorter. 
  * In the Bible, a lot was a marked stone that was thrown or rolled on the ground in order to help them decide something. 

The priests believed that God guided the lot to show them which priest he wanted them to choose. The Jewish method, as explained by a historian named Maimonides, states that the group of priests would stand in a circle and agree upon a number. All the men would then hold up his fingers (not including the thumb.) Then the leader of the Priests would take the headpiece, see picture below, off the head of one of the men and start counting the number of fingers that each man would hold up.\\

When the number was reached by counting fingers then that group of priests would do one of these tasks:


    * slay the animal sacrifices
    * sprinkle the blood
    * remove the ashes from the innermost altar
    * remove the ashes from the candlestick and trim the lamps
    * bring up the parts of the animal sacrifice to the altar
