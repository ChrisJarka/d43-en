\v 14 We thank God because we are joined with Christ, and he always leads us like those who have won the war! Through our lives and our message, everywhere we go, we are like the fragrance of incense that people love to smell, and that fragrance comes from knowing Christ.
\v 15  Our lives burn like incense to God, a sweet aroma that reminds God of Christ who lives in us. And to those whom God rescues we are to them a fragrance of Christ, and we have that fragrance of Christ even to those whom God does not rescue.
