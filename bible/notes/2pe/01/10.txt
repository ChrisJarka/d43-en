===== Translation Notes: =====
Peter continues to talk to the believers.

  * **Therefore** - The word "therefore" begins the response of the believer to what was previously stated.
  * **make your calling and election sure for yourselves** - The word "calling" refers to God's general invitation of salvation to all people. The word "election" refers to the specific people that God has chosen. These two words have similar meanings. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])  
  * **you will not stumble** - AT: "you will not fail morally or spiritually." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
