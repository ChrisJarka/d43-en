===== What is Translation =====

For our purposes, translation is a process performed between different languages that involves a person (the translator) changing a text from one language into a different language.

There are basically two kinds of translations: literal and dynamic. 
  * Very literal translations focus on using words that have the same meanings and phrases that have similar structures to the phrases in the first language.   
  * Dynamic translations focus on the meaning of the sentence, but may use different words and phrases.
