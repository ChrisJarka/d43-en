\v 9 So, do not let yourselves be diverted so that you believe various teachings that are contrary to God's truth. God strengthens our hearts by his love which we do not deserve, not by rules about various foods, rules which  have not benefited those who obeyed them. Such rules will not benefit us either.


\p
\v 10 Those who served in the Sacred Tent have no authority to eat from or serve from the sacred altar in which we trust, the cross of Jesus Christ. As the only One worthy to provide eternal salvation to mankind, only Jesus can serve from the altar of the cross.
\v 11 After the high priest brings into the very holy place the blood of animals that they have sacrificed to atone for sins, the bodies of those animals are burned outside the camp.
