\q
\v 9 Proclaim this in the fortresses at Ashdod,
\q and in the fortresses in the land of Egypt;
\q say, "Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria
\q and see what great confusion is in her,
\q and what oppression is in her.
\q
\v 10 For they do not know how to do right
\q —this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q They store up violence
\q and destruction in their fortresses."
