<usfm>
\v 24 Instead of sweet perfume there shall be stench; and instead of a sash, a rope; and
instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a dress of sackcloth; a prisoner branding instead of beauty.
\v 25 Your men will fall by the sword, and your, your strong men in the war.
\v 26 And her gates will lament and mourn; and she will be alone and sit upon the ground.
