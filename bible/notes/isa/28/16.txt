===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **See** - "Listen to this"
  * **I will lay in Zion a foundation stone** - Yahweh compares what he will do for the people of Jerusalem to a builder using a strong rock to make a solid support so that the building placed on top of it will be secure and not fall down. This emphasizes that Yahweh will give them something that will truly save them if the people trust in it. This may be a reference to the Messiah. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a tried stone** - "a stone that is proven to be solid"
  * **a sure foundation** - "a firm foundation"
  * **He who believes will not be ashamed** - This is a response to the leaders scorn in verse 15.  "Anyone who believes in the foundation stone placed by Yahweh will not be sorry"
