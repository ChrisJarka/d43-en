===== Explicit and Implicit =====

There are two different forms of communication found in both written and spoken messages. One is called **//explicit//** and the other //**implicit**//. The speaker, or writer, has a particular audience in mind as he gives the message. This affects the form of his message and his decision on what information to include or leave out.
   * A message with all information included is **explicit**,
  * A message that leaves out information but is still understood is **implicit**.
Although implicit information is not stated in words and only implied, it is information that the hearer needs to know if he is to understand the meaning of the message. The speaker, or writer, has succeeded in communicating his message if the hearer correctly understands what was clearly stated as well as what was implied.
