Email the KT team managers (Andrew and Lizz) that a new page has been requested for a specific notes page.

The KT team managers will:

  * The KT team will see the list of chunks that need KT's on their admin page.
  * Once they have created the page, they will delete the tag.

If you have any comments about an existing KT page, notify the Translation Notes Teams Manager about the discussion. They will in turn notify the Key Terms Team Leader.
