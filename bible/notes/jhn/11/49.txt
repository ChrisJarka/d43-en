\v 50 You do not realize that it would be much better for us if one man died for the sake of the people rather than that \add the Romans kill\add* all the \add people of our Jewish\add* nation."

\v 49 One of them on the Council was Caiaphas, the high priest for that year. He said to them, "You all know nothing!
\v 50 Do you not realize that it is better that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perishes?"

<usfm>
\v 49 However, a certain man among them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all.
\v 50 You do not take into account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people rather than that the whole nation should perish."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **a certain man among them** - This is a way to introduce a new character to the story. If you have a way to do this in your language, you can use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **You know nothing at all** - This is an exaggeration that Caiaphas uses to add emphasis to his point. AT: "You do not understand what is happening!" or "You speak as though you know nothing at all!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **rather than that the whole nation should perish** - Caiaphas implies that the Roman army would kill all of the people of the Jewish nation if Jesus is allowed to live and cause a rebellion. The word "nation" here is a synecdoche that represents all of the Jewish people. AT: "rather than that the Romans kill all the people of our nation." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicitinfo]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
