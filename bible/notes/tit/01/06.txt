===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 An elder must be without guilt, the husband of one wife, and his children must trust in God and not be thought of as wicked or undisciplined.
\v 7 Each person who is a leader of God's people is like God’s house manager. So it is necessary for this person to be guiltless of claims against him. He should not be loud and unrestrained in his behavior. He should not hold anger within his breast, not an alcoholic, not someone who likes to fight and argue, not a greedy man.
