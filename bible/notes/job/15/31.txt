====== Job 15:31-33 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 If they are very foolish, with the result that they trust in things that are really worthless,
\q2 then things that are worthless will be all that they get.
\q1
\v 32 While they are still young, they will disappear;
\q2 they will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* branches that wither and never become green again.
\q1
\v 33 They will be like \f + \ft simile \f* vines whose grapes fall off before they are ripe,
\q2 like olive trees whose blossoms fall off before they produce any fruit.

\v 31 Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself;
\q For vanity shall be his recompense.

\v 32 It shall be accomplished before his time,
\q And his branch shall not be green.
\q
\v 33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,
\q And shall cast off his flower as the olive-tree.
