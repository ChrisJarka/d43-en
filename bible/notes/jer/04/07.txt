<usfm>
\v 7 A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make
your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.
\v 8 For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned back from us.
