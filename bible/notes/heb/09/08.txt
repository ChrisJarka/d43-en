\v 8 By those things the Holy Spirit indicated that \add just like God\add* did not reveal the way \add for ordinary people\add* to enter into the inner room while the outer room still existed \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add similarly he did not reveal the way for ordinary people to enter the presence of God while the Jewish system of offering sacrifices was in effect\add*.
\v 9 \add The things that the priests did inside the outer room\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* symbolized \add what was true\add* during the time \add when the first covenant was in effect\add*. According to \add the first covenant\add* (OR\add , In that outer room\add*), \add priests\add* offered gifts and other sacrifices to God. But \add by offering them\add*, the people who brought them were unable to make themselves feel that they were no longer guilty for having sinned.
\v 10 \add They brought those gifts and made those sacrifices\add* according to \add regulations concerning\add* things to eat and drink, and \add according to rules that required people to\add* wash various things. \add God\add* declared that those regulations about our bodies were to be in effect until \add he put into effect the new covenant\add*; that was a better system.

\v 8 By those things the Holy Spirit indicated that just like God did not reveal the way for ordinary people to enter into the inner room, the very holy place, while the outer room still existed, similarly he did not reveal the way for ordinary people to enter the presence of God while the Jewish system of offering sacrifices was in effect.
\v 9 The things that the priests did inside the Sacred Tent symbolize the present time, when Christ has fulfilled these symbols. The gifts and sacrifices offered in the Sacred Tent could not permanently remove God's judgment for our sin and replace it with the peace of God's eternal forgiveness, which only Jesus can give us.
\v 10 They brought those gifts and made those sacrifices according to regulations concerning things to eat and drink and wash various things. God declared that those regulations about our bodies were to be in effect until he enacted the new covenant, which was a better system.

\v 8 The Holy Spirit is demonstrating that the way into the most holy place has not yet been revealed as long as the outer room is still standing.
\v 9 This is a figure for the present time. Both the gifts and sacrifices  which are offered are not able to perfect the conscience of the worshipper. 
\v 10 They are only food and drink  and various washings, physical regulations provided until the time the new covenant would be established.
