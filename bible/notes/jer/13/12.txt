\v 12 Therefore you shall speak to them this word: Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with
wine: and they shall say to thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
\v 13 Then shall you say to them, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings
that sit upon David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
\v 14 And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says Jehovah: I will not pity, nor
spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.
