\v 41 Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of your people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for your
nameâ€™s sake
\v 42 (for they shall hear of your great name, and of your mighty hand, and of your outstretched arm); when he shall come and
pray toward this house;
\v 43 hear you in heaven your dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the
peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear thee, as does your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I
have built is called by your name.
