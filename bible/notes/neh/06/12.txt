\v 12 And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had
hired him.
\v 13 For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil
report, that they might reproach me.
\v 14 Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of
the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
