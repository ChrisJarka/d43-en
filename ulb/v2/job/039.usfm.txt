\c 39
\q
\v 1 Know you the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?
\q Or can you mark when the hinds do calve?
\q
\v 2 Canst you number the months that they fulfil?
\q Or know you the time when they bring forth?
\q
\v 3 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young,
\q They cast out their pains.
\q
\v 4 Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field;
\q They go forth, and return not again.
\b
\q
\v 5 Who has sent out the wild ass free?
\q Or who has loosed the bonds of the swift ass,
\q
\v 6 Whose home I have made the wilderness,
\q And the salt land his dwelling-place?
\q
\v 7 He scorneth the tumult of the city,
\q Neither hears he the shoutings of the driver.
\q
\v 8 The range of the mountains is his pasture,
\q And he searcheth after every green thing.
\q
\v 9 Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee?
\q Or will he abide by your crib?
\q
\v 10 Canst you bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow?
\q Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
\q
\v 11 Wilt you trust him, because his strength is great?
\q Or will you leave to him your labor?
\q
\v 12 Wilt you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed,
\q And gather the grain of your threshing-floor?
\b
\q
\v 13 The wings of the ostrich wave proudly;
\q But are they the pinions and plumage of love?
\q
\v 14 For she leaves her eggs on the earth,
\q And warmeth them in the dust,
\q
\v 15 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,
\q Or that the wild beast may trample them.
\q
\v 16 She deals hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers:
\q Though her labor be in vain, she is without fear;
\q
\v 17 Because God has deprived her of wisdom,
\q Neither has he imparted to her understanding.
\q
\v 18 What time she lifts up herself on high,
\q She scorneth the horse and his rider.
\b
\q
\v 19 Hast you given the horse his might?
\q Hast you clothed his neck with the quivering mane?
\q
\v 20 Hast you made him to leap as a locust?
\q The glory of his snorting is terrible.
\q
\v 21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoices in his strength:
\q He goes out to meet the armed men.
\q
\v 22 He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed;
\q Neither turns he back from the sword.
\q
\v 23 The quiver rattleth against him,
\q The flashing spear and the javelin.
\q
\v 24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage;
\q Neither believes he that it is the voice of the trumpet.
\q
\v 25 As often as the trumpet soundeth he saith, Aha!
\q And he smelleth the battle afar off,
\q The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
\b
\q
\v 26 Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soareth,
\q And stretches her wings toward the south?
\q
\v 27 Is it at your command that the eagle mounteth up,
\q And makes her nest on high?
\q
\v 28 On the cliff she dwelleth, and makes her home,
\q Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.
\q
\v 29 From thence she spieth out the prey;
\q Her eyes behold it afar off.
\q
\v 30 Her young ones also suck up blood:
\q And where the slain are, there is she.
