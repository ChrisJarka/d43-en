\c 16
\p
\v 1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.
\v 2 Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made
when I come.
\v 3 And when I arrive, whoever you shall approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty to Jerusalem:
\v 4 and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me.
\v 5 But I will come to you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia;
\v 6 but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that you may set me forward on my journey wherever I go.
\v 7 For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to wait a while with you, if the Lord permit.
\v 8 But I will wait at Ephesus until Pentecost;
\v 9 for a great door and effectual is opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
\p
\v 10 Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do:
\v 11 let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me: for I expect him
with the brethren.
\v 12 But as touching Apollos the brother, I implored him much to come to you with the brethren: and it was not at all
his will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity.
\p
\v 13 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
\v 14 Let all that you do be done in love.
\p
\v 15 Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set
themselves to minister to the saints),
\v 16 that you also be in subjection to such, and to every one that helps in the work and laboreth.
\v 17 And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they
supplied.
\v 18 For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge you therefore them that are such.
\p
\v 19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
\v 20 All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.
\p
\v 21 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
\v 22 If any man loves not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha.
\v 23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
\v 24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
