\v 19 Therefore thus says Jehovah, If you return, then will I bring you again, that you may stand before me; and if you
take forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth: they shall return to thee, but you shall not return to
them.
\v 20 And I will make you to this people a fortified brazen wall; and they shall fight against you, but they shall not
prevail against you; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, says Jehovah.
\v 21 And I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.
