\v 4 The diseased have you not strengthened, neither have you healed that which was sick, neither have you bound up that which was
broken, neither have you brought back that which was driven away, neither have you sought that which was lost; but with force and
with rigor have you ruled over them.
\v 5 And they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food to all the beasts of the field, and were
scattered.
\v 6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my sheep were scattered upon all the face of
the earth; and there was none that did search or seek after
them.
