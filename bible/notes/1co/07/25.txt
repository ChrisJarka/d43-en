\v 25 Now \add I will answer your question\add* about women who have never married. There is nothing that the Lord has commanded me \add to write about them\add*, but I am writing this to tell you what I think \add is best\add*, because the Lord \add Jesus\add* has mercifully enabled what I \add say\add* to be reliable.
\v 26 There are a lot of distressing events \add happening\add* now \f + \ft Or: that will soon happen \f*, so I think that it is better for people to remain in the status that they now have.

\v 25 Regarding the question about those who have never married, I will give my views, but I have no commandment from the Lord on this queston. But you can have confidence in my reply because, by the Lord's mercy, he confirms my trustworthiness to answer this question.
\v 26 Therefore, because of the impending crisis, with so many matters of life, politics, and safety at risk, I think it is good for you to remain in the state of marriage or celibacy you are in. The times ahead look difficult for us all.
