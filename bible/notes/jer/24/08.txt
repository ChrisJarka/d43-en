\v 8 But like the bad figs that are too bad to be eatenâ€”this is what Yahweh says, I will do thus with Zedekiah, king of Judah and his officials and the rest of Jerusalem who remain in this land or 
abide in the land of Egypt.
\v 9 For I will make them a frightening thing and a calamity to all the kingdoms of the earth, a disgrace and a proverb, a taunt and a curse in every place where I will have driven them.
\v 10 So I will send out the sword, famine, and plague upon them they are worn off of the land that I gave them and their fathers.
