\v 4 If any descendant of Aaron has a contagious skin disease or a discharge from his sexual organs, he is not allowed to eat any of the sacred offerings until he is cured. He will also be unfit for his work if he touches anything which has become unacceptable to me because it has touched a corpse, or if he touches anyone who as an emission of semen,
\v 5 or if he touches anything that crawls on the ground, or if he touches any person who causes him to be unfit for his work.
\v 6 Any priest who touches such things must bathe, and he must not touch anyone else until that evening.

\v 4 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or has an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso touches anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goes from him;
\v 5 or whoever touches any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatever uncleanness he hath;
\v 6 the soul that touches any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.
