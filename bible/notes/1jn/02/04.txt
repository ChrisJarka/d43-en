\v 4 He that saith, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;
\v 5 but whoso keeps his word, in him verily has the love of God been perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him:
\v 6 he that says he remains in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.
