====== abyss ======


===== Definition: =====


An abyss is a large hole or chasm without a bottom.


    * The abyss in the Bible is also called "sheol" and "hades", but is distinct from the "lake of fire", "hell", and "gehenna" which refer to the permanent place of punishment.
    * The word "abyss" could also be translated as "bottomless pit" or "deep chasm."
