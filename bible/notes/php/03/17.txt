\v 17 Brothers, join me and imitate me, and watch closely those living by our example.
\v 18  I have often told you and tell you now with tears that many are living as the enemies of the cross of Christ.
\v 19 Their end is destruction because their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their thinking is on earthly things.
