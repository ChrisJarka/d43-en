\v 1 Then he returned me to the door of the house and behold! Waters were going out from under the threshold of the house towards the east, for the front of the house was eastward, and the waters were going down from under the opposite side of the house towards the sea from the south side of the altar.
\v 2 So he brought me out to the way of the northern gate and led me along the way outside to the outside gate of the way facing east, and behold! Waters were trickling from the opposite side towards right side.
