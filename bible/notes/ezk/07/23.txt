\v 23 Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
\v 24 Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the
strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.
\v 25 Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.
