====== Biblical Weight ======

===== Description =====

The following terms are the most common units of weight in the Bible. The term "shekel" means "weight" and many other weights are described in terms of the shekel. Some of these weights were used for money. The exact weights are uncertain, but the approximate amounts are:

  * Shekel - 11 grams
  * Bekah - (1/2 shekel)
  * Pim - (2/3 shekel)
  * Gerah - (1/20 of a shekel)
  * Mina - 600 grams (50 shekels)
  * Talent - 34 kilograms (60 minas, 3000 shekels)

=== Translation Principles === 

  - Using words that closely resemble the Biblical terms for measuring weights shows that the Bible is a historical document and that real people used these units of measurement during that time period.

==== Translation Strategies ==== 

  - Keep the Bible term and spell it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible.
  - State the same amount of weight using a unit of measure that is known.
  - Use the Bible term and give the equivalent amount in the text or a note.
