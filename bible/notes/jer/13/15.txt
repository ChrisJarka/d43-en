\q
\v 15 Listen and pay attention. Do not be arrogant, for Yahweh had spoken.
\q
\v 16 Give honor to Yahweh your God before he brings darkness,
\q and before he causes your feet to stumble on the mountains at twilight.
\q For you are hoping for light, but he will turn the place into a deep darkness, into a dark cloud.
\q
\v 17 So if you will not listen, I will weep alone because of your arrogance.
\q My eyes will certainly weep and flow with tears, for Yahweh's flock has been taken captive.
