    * **Sir** - The man said this to show respect to Jesus.
    * **when the water is stirred up** - An angel would come and stir the water and the first person who got down into the water after the water was stirred would be healed of whatever disease that person has. This can be changed into the active voice: "when an angel stirs up the water." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
