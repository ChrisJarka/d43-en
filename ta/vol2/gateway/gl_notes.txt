===== Translate the Notes =====

This module answers the question: What are the guidelines for translating or adapting the Notes?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol2:gateway:gl_adaptulb|Adapt the ULB]]
  * [[en:ta:vol2:gateway:gl_ulb|Translating the ULB]]

When you translate the Notes, you must also have both the ULB and the UDB in front of you, already translated into the target Gateway Language. You must have the ULB available so that you can copy the part of the ULB text that the Note is talking about directly into the Note. You must also have the UDB text already translated and available, because the Notes often copy part of the UDB text in order to show another way to translate the same part of the verse.

In addition, the Notes directly comment on parts of the ULB text, so you must read the part of the ULB text that the Note comments on in order to properly translate the Note. After you read and understand the ULB text, then you can translate the Note so that it makes sense together with the ULB text that it refers to.

===Adapting the Notes===

Often, the ULB in the target Gateway Language will say things in a different way than the ULB said them in English. In order for the Note to be useful in the target Gateway Language, you will need to adapt the Note so that it talks about the text of the ULB as it is in the Gateway Language translation. This means that you will need to copy the phrase that is the translation of the same phrase from the English ULB into the Note, and then change the Note so that it makes sense and is helpful for the Other Language translator who will use these Notes as translation tools.

Because languages can be very different from each other, sometimes there will be Notes that are important and necessary for some languages, but that are not needed for other languages. If there is a Note that does not make sense when applied to the ULB text in the target Gateway Language, then you as the translator will need to modify the Note so that it does make sense in relation to the ULB in your target Gateway Language. 

For the same reason, sometimes you will realize that the Other Language translator will need a Note in order to understand a phrase in the target Gateway Language ULB, but there might not be a Note already written for that phrase. In that case, you will need to write a new Note and include it in your translation.

Remember that speakers of many different languages will be using these Gateway Language Notes to help them translate the Bible. Even if it seems that a Note is not necessary for the Gateway Language translation of some verses, be sure to translate all of the Notes anyway. There will probably be many Other Language translators who will benefit from reading the Note and who will apply it when translating into their language.
