====== Numbers 19:20-22 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 If those who have become unacceptable to me do not become acceptable to me again by doing this, they will no longer belong to the Israelite people, because they have defiled my Sacred Tent. They did not sprinkle on themselves the water that removes the guilt of their sins, so they remain unacceptable to me.
\v 21 That is a law for the Israelite people that will never be changed. Those who sprinkle that water on themselves must then wash their clothes. And anyone who touches that water which removes guilt for sins will remain unacceptable to God until that evening.
\p
\v 22 Anything and any person whom someone who has become unacceptable to me has touched will remain unacceptable to me until that evening."

\p
\v 20 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah: the water for impurity has not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
\v 21 And it shall be a perpetual statute to them: and he that sprinkleth the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he that touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until even.
\v 22 And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until even.
