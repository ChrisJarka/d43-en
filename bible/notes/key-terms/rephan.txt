====== Rephan ======

===== Facts: =====

Rephan was a false god in the Old Testament.

  * While the Israelites were in the wilderness, some of them worshiped Rephan instead of the one true God, Yahweh.
  * It could be that Rephan (meaning "giant") actually refers to Moloch which is mentioned earlier in the same verse.
