\p
\v 16 When I first defended myself\add in court here\add*, no one came along \add to help defend\add* me. Instead, they all left me. \add I pray\add* that it will not be counted against \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will forgive \f* them \f + \ft litotes \f* \add for leaving me\add*.

\v 14 Alexander the metalworker acted very badly toward me. The Lord will ppunish him for what he has done.
\v 15 You also should be on guard against him because he did everything possible to stop our preaching.
\p
\v 16 The first time I stood in court and explained my work, no believers stood by my side to encourage me. They all stayed away. May God not hold them responsible for this.
