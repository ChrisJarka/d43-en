====== Jeremiah 04:30-31 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 So you who will surely be destroyed,
\q2 \add why are you doing the things that you are doing now\add*?
\q2 Why are you wearing beautiful clothes and jewelry?
\q2 Why are you putting paint around your eyes?
\q1 Doing those things will not help you,
\q2 because the people \add in other countries that you think\add* love you really despise you,
\q2 and they will try to kill you.
\b
\q1
\v 31 \add It is as though\add* I already hear \add the people in Jerusalem\add* crying very loudly,
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* a woman cries when she is giving birth to her first child;
\q1 she gasps for breath and pleads for someone to help her,
\q2 crying, "Something terrible is happening to me; they are about to murder me!"

\v 30 So you who will surely be destroyed,
\q2 what will you do then?
\q2 Even though you have worn beautiful clothes and jewelry
\q2 and paint around your eyes,
\q1 those things will not help you,
\q2 because the people in other countries that you think love you really despise you,
\q2 and they will try to kill you.
\q1
\v 31 It is as though I already hear the people in Jerusalem crying very loudly,
\q2 as a woman cries when she is giving birth to her first child;
\q1 she gasps for breath and pleads for someone to help her,
\q2 and she shouts, 'Something terrible is happening to me; they are about to murder me!'"

<usfm>
\v 30 Now that you have been devastated, what will you do? For though you dress in scarlet, adorn yourself with gold jewelry, and make your eyes look bigger with paint, the men who lusted for you now reject you. Instead, they are trying to take away your life.
\v 31 So I hear the sound of anguish, distress as in the birth of a firstborn child, the sound of the daughter of Zion. She is gasping for breath. She spreads out her hands, 'Woe to me! I am fainting because of these murderers.'"
