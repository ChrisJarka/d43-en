The people there thought that they were safe, because there was no one nearby to cause trouble for them, they were far from Sidon, and they rarely had contact with any outsiders.

\v 7 Then the five men departed and came to Laish, and looked at the people who were there. They say how they were living in peace, as the people of Sidon did—
for there was no one in the land that had any authority to shame them in any way; moreover, they were far from the people of Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else.
\v 8 They went bac to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol. Their brothers said to them, “What do you have to say?”
