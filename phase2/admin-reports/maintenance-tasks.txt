**Do not add to content below.**

This is a list of ongoing tasks and tasks that we are postponing until after Phase 2 is complete.

This page is a "work in progress." New tasks need to be added and existing tasks need to be evaluated.

This list may get long. It may make it easier to see what is here if we list the tasks alphabetically by translation issue.

==== One-time tasks: ====

  * **Active or Passive tA page** - Change to "Dealing with Passives" and include using stative clauses as a translation strategy. Also discuss the pros and cons of active and passive (and perhaps stative).
  * **Anthropomorphism tA page**  - Write page and make links to it to deal with God being spoken of as if he had a body???
  * **"Facing east" notes** - See suggestion in discussion on Ezk 40:05.
  * **Hyperbole tA page**  - Change to "Hyperbole and Generalization" and change explanation.
  * **Hyperbole TNs**- Correct hyperbole explanations to "exaggeration" or "generalization."
  * **Job 31**  - Deal with "then bring charges against me" added to 21, 25, 29, 32, and 34.
  * **"Like" notes**  when it does not mean "is like Y means "is Y." Figure out how to explain these. Add explanations where needed. [[:en:bible:notes:job:29:25|Job 29:25]]
