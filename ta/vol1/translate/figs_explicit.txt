===== Explicit and Implicit =====

This module answers the question: What do the words explicit and implicit mean?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: ['figs_intro']

There are two different forms of communication found in both written and spoken messages. One is called **//explicit//** and the other //**implicit**//. The speaker, or writer, has a particular audience in mind as he gives the message. This affects the form of his message and his decision on what information to include or leave out.
   * A message with all information included is **explicit**,
  * A message that leaves out information but is still understood is **implicit**.
Although implicit information is not stated in words and only implied, it is information that the hearer needs to know if he is to understand the meaning of the message. The speaker, or writer, has succeeded in communicating his message if the hearer correctly understands what was clearly stated as well as what was implied.



Next we recommend you learn about: ['figs_metaphor', 'figs_simile', 'figs_rquestion', 'figs_idiom', 'figs_irony', 'figs_123person', 'figs_order', 'figs_you', 'figs_youdual', 'figs_yousingular', 'figs_explicitinfo', 'figs_hypo', 'figs_events', 'figs_parables']
