\v 16 And Jehovah raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that despoiled them.
\v 17 And yet they listened not to their judges; for they played the harlot after other gods, and bowed themselves down to
them: they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Jehovah;
but they did not so.
