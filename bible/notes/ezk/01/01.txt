\v 1-2 "When I, Ezekiel, was 30 years old, I was living among the Israelite people who had been exiled from Judah and brought to Babylon along the Kebar River, a canal south of Babylon. On the fifth day of the fourth month of that year, it was as though the sky was opened and I saw visions from God.
\p The fifth day of the fourth month was almost five years after King Jehoiachin had been exiled."
\v 3 So God gave Ezekiel the preist, the son of Buzi, messages in Babylonia while he lived beside the Kebar River. Yahweh's power went to him there.
