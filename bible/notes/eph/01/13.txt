\v 13 Now you Ephesians and other non-Jews have heard the true message, the good news that Jesus saves everyone who believes him. And you have believed in Christ, so it is as if God's Spirit had marked you on your foreheads to show that you belong to God.
\v 14 The Holy Spirit is proof that we will receive all that God has promised. All this is great reason to praise him!

\v 13 It was by Christ that you also heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation by Christ. It was in him that you also have believed and were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit.

\v 14 The Spirit is the guarantee of our inheritance until the possession is gained. This was for the praise of his glory.
