\v 19 My relationship with the Lord Jesus \add leads me\add* to confidently expect that \add he will enable me\add* to send Timothy to you soon, in order that \add his telling you the news about me will encourage you. But\add* I also expect that \add his returning to me and\add* telling me the news about you will encourage me.
\v 20 \add Keep in mind that\add* I have no one \add else\add* like him who genuinely cares for you.
\v 21 All the others \add whom I have considered that I might send to you\add* are concerned \add only\add* about their own matters. They are not concerned about what Jesus Christ \add considers important\add*.

\v 20 I have no one else like Timothy who genuinely cares for you.
\v 21 All the others whom I might send to you are concerned only about their own matters. They are not concerned enough about what Jesus Christ considers important.
