===What is Ezekiel about?===

The book contains 47 oracles or prophecies. These oracles occured between 592 BC and 573 BC. Most of the oracles appear to be in chronological order, but some of them could be read in the order in which the events were compiled. Ezekiel makes known to the people of Israel that God sees everything, every sin, every adultery, every act of idolatry, every lie, that they have done, and that judgment and punishment by Yahweh is impossible to escape. Ultimately, Judah will be restored. God will use Babylon to punish them, but before the restoration of Jerusalem is prophesied, the enemy nations must be crushed. There is prophecy about the restoration and renewal of worship , the sacrificial system, and the new Temple. The book of Ezekiel ends with the reallocation of the lands among all the people of Israel, reclaiming lands lost by their disobedience. Ezekiel concludes with the overarching principle that “Yahweh is there." 


===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Ezekiel" may also be called the "The book about Ezekiel" or "The sayings of Ezekiel."

===Who wrote Ezekiel?===
The book of Ezekiel was likely written by Ezekiel, a prophet who lived near Babylon in the time of the exile. He was from a priestly family.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
===What is Ezekiel's temple?===

A large portion of the book of Ezekiel gives instructions regarding the building of a new temple. The temple in Ezekiel is not the same as the temple the people built under the leadership of Ezra. Because Ezekiel's temple has never been built, it is likely that the temple will be built in the in the future although some believe that Ezekiel's temple is symbolic of the church and describes a location in heaven.

===Do the sacrifices in Ezekiel follow the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of moses]]?===

If one was to compare some of the required sacrifices in Numbers 28 with the sacrifices in Ezekiel 46, there is some variation. This variation is likely because Ezekiel prophesies about a new temple with a new sacrificial system.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

===How do I translate Ezekiel's visions?===

The book of Ezekiel has many dazzling visions and stunning images. Ezekiel is very different from the message or manner of prophecy of most of the prophetic books. His visions are complicated and far-reaching, his speech is ecstatic, and these prophecies became the foundation for many apocalyptic books of Scripture. His visions should be read as they stand, with care to neither make them more rational and real, nor to read into them what may be only suggested by the text.
Also, there are events recorded where it is unclear if Ezekiel has traveled to particular places, or that he simply “sees” the places he is describing. The meaning of the visions may be clear, but the point of view of the prophet may be difficult to grasp. The visions and euphoric language can be difficult to follow, but the focus in on Israel’s rescue and events in the far distant future.

===What does "and you will know that I am the Lord" mean?===

This is a common phrase that in Ezekiel. It speaks of the inevitability of God's judgment and that he will bring about what he has promised. The translator may also use the phrase "and you will understand that I am God and what I say will happen."

===What is an allegory?===
