Patterns in Biblical imagery

====== Part One: Patterned conceptual associations ======

As in languages everywhere, most **metaphors** in Biblical Hebrew and Greek fall into broad patterns that are often unique to these languages. It is very useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere.

After becoming familiar with these patterns, translators will see that many biblical **similes** are also built on these same conceptual associations. For this reason, it is often instructive to consider similes together with metaphors analysis. In this light, metaphors and similes should be viewed as different strategies for effecting many of the same conceptual associations, but for different purposes related to discourse and audience-reader dynamics.

These patterns of associating Concept A with Concept B present three challenges to anyone who wants to identify them:

(1) The surface manifestations of most Biblical metaphors usually obscure their underlying structures. For example, it may not be immediately obvious that the expression //It is God who puts strength on me like a belt// Ps. 18:32 (ULB) is authorized by the pattern CLOTHING IS MORAL QUALITY (see no. 4 below).

(2) As with all language, the context, i.e., the surrounding text or “co-text,” must determine the sense of an expression. Thus, for example, whether “lamp” refers concretely to a container with oil and a wick for giving light, or whether it refers instead to the notion of life (see LAMP OR FIRE IS LIFE below), depends on the context.

(3) Expressions that are authorized by these conceptual associations frequently combine together in complex ways. Moreover, they frequently combine with—and in some cases are based on—common metonymies (see Part Two below) and cultural models (see Part Three below).

What follows is a list of some of the frequent underlying structural metaphors in the Old Testament, together with examples of their actual textual manifestations. They are organized by semantic domain of the images:

A. Body parts and human qualities

B. Human behavior

C. Animals

D. Plant life

===== H. Master Metaphorical Patterns =====

=====   =====

These patterns often overlay other metaphorical patterns, so they can be called master patterns.

H1. ABSTRACT CONCEPTS ARE PERSONS (Personification)

H2. CONCRETE CONCEPTS ARE PERSONS (anthropomorphism)

H3. PAST TENSE IS FUTURE TIME (in predictive prophecy)

H4. NON-NOMINAL ENTITIES ARE NOMINAL ENTITIES (concepts that are inherently non-nouns by nature are manipulated both conceptually and syntactically as nouns)

===== Part Two: Common Metonymies =====

MET1 A PERSON IS THE ACTIVE MEMORY OF HIS ANCESTOR

MET2 ONE PERSON IS MANY PEOPLE

MET3 SINS ARE PUNISHMENT

  * //Yahweh has placed on him the iniquity of us all //  (Isa. 53:6) = Yahweh has placed on him the punishment that should have gone to all of us.
MET4 PIERCING IS KILLING

  * //His hand pierced the fleeing serpent//. (Job 26:13 ULB) = his hand pierced and killed the fleeing serpent
  * //But I will pour out a spirit of compassion and supplication upon the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so they will look on me, the one they have pierced//! (Zech. 12:10 ULB) = so they will look on me, the one they have pierced and killed
  * //Look, he is coming with the clouds; every eye will see him, including those who pierced him//. (Rev. 1:7 ULB) = including those who pierced him and killed him
MET5 A CUP IS ITS CONTENTS

  * //“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me//.” Luke 22:42 (ULB)
  * //The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ?//  I Cor. 10:16 (ULB)
  * //"This cup is the new covenant in my blood…”//  1 Cor. 11:25 (ULB)
  * //“In the cup she mixed, mix double the amount for her.”//  Rev. 18:6 (ULB)
MET6 MOUTH IS SPEECH, WORDS

  * //A fool’s mouth is his ruin.//  Prov. 18:7 (ULB)
  * //Oh, how I would encourage you with my mouth!//  Job 16:5 (ULB)
  * //For I will give you words //  (lit.,// mouth//) //and wisdom, which all your adversaries will not be able to resist or contradict.//  Luke 21:15 (ULB)
  * //I heard you when you boasted against me with your mouth; you said many things against me. I heard them.//  Ezek. 35:13 (ULB)
===== Part Three: Cultural Models =====

The Scriptures also employ cultural models, which can be described as systems of thought that are more elaborate and more developed than the metaphorical patterns and metonymies presented above. Some of these models, at least, were employed extensively in the Ancient Near East, and not only among the Israelites.

 \\ **Model of Theophany (God revealing himself) **

 \\ Ps. 18:7-14 \\  \\  \\ **Model of God as a Warrior**

  * //For you will turn them back; you will draw your bow before them//. Ps. 21:12 (ULB)
 \\  \\ **Model of God as a King**

**The Wilderness as a Model for Distressing Situations** \\  \\  \\ **Containment Model of the Sun at Night**

  * //Yet their words go out over all the earth and their speech to the end of the world. He has pitched a tent for the sun among them. The sun is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and like a strong man who rejoices when he runs his race//. Ps. 19:4-5 (ULB)
  * //In the womb of the dawn go out like the dew of your youth. //  Ps. 110:3c (ULB)
**Blood Model of Life**

In this model, the blood of a person or an animal represents life.

  * //In this way, this person would not die by the hand of the one who wanted to avenge the blood of the person who was killed, until he stood before the congregation//. Josh. 20:9 (ULB)
If it is spilled, someone has killed.

If it is poured out, there is death.

If it cries out, nature itself is claiming vengeance (via Personification)

**Model of a country and its god**

**Model of the Wind as futility**

**Model of covenants**

**Model of human warfare as divine warfare**

**Model of geographical boundaries as other constraints in life**

**Model of wellbeing as physical cleanliness, of evil as physical dirtiness**

**Model of honor and shame**

**Model of good as existing in limited amounts**

**Model of the nation of Israel as God's son**

  * //When Israel was a young man I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt. //  Hos. 11:1 (ULB)
