Now Christ \add is directing how\add* I\add behave. And whatever I do\add* now while I live, I do it trusting in God's Son. He is the one who loved me and offered himself \add as a sacrifice\add* for me.
\v 21 I am not rejecting \add as useless\add* what God \add did for me\add* \add kindly\f + \ft Or: that I did not deserve\add* \f*, \add as my opponents are doing. I fully accept that God saved me by acting kindly towards me\add*. If it is because people \add obey the\add* laws \add that God gave to Moses\add* that God erases the record of their sins, then Christ died for nothing\f + \ft Or: needlessly \f*.

<usfm>
\v 20 It is as though my old way of life ended when Christ died on the cross. I no longer direct my life. Christ who lives in my heart now directs how I live. And whatever I do now while I live, I do it trusting in God's Son. He is the one who loved me and offered himself as the sacrifice to provide God's forgiveness to me.
\v 21 I do not set aside God's kindness, as if keeping the law could make us right with God. Otherwise, Christ would have died on the cross for nothing.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
\v 21 I do not negate the grace of God. For if righteousness existed through the law, then Christ would have died for nothing.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God** - Paul uses the imagery of Christ's crucifixion to describe his life of "faith in the Son of God." The title "Son of God" must be maintained in translations because it speaks of Jesus' cross and our Savior. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **I do not negate** - AT: "I do not set aside" (UDB) or "I do not make of no value" 
  * **if righteousness existed through the law, then Christ would have died for nothing** - That is, because righteousness did not exist through the law, Christ did not die for nothing.
  * **would have died for nothing** - AT: "would have accomplished nothing by dying"
