\v 20 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations
and their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing.
\v 21 And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall
profane it.
\v 22 My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret
place; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.
