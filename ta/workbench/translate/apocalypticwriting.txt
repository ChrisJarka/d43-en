==== Description ====

God showed his prophets things he would do in the future. Some of these things have already happened, and some will happen in our future. 

God showed many of these things using symbolic language.This may include violent or power events that may be hard to believe or seem impossible

Reason this is a translation issue:

=== Translation Principles === 
  * Translate the images in the text. Do not try to interpret them and translate their meaning.
    * Some images may be about miraculous events,
    * Other images may be symbols of other things.

Writings about the end of this world are different than many other writings in Scripture. They contrast this present evil age with the coming age. There is encouragement that God will finally bring perfect justice to this world and he will bring victory in the greatest battle the world has seen. Together the writings about the end of this world form one story, across several books, about God’s complete control over the events of the world. 

Writings about the end of this world can come in many different forms. They are a special type of prophecy which can take the form of narrative or poetry. Usually they contain unusual, otherworldly events which have been divinely revealed in a supernatural way. 

Writings of this type contain lots of symbolism which is often rooted in the Old Testament and previous revelation. This may create difficulties if the complete Old Testament has not been translated. Because these writings form their own story alongside the normal narrative of Scripture, they share a great deal of common terminology and images. If possible, the translator should try to correspond the terms used in this style in one book with the terms used in this writing style in a different book. If the translator does not have have access to other adequately translated book (like Daniel), they may wish to consult  another  translation. 

Much of the uniqueness of this style involves the use of paradox. A paradox is a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement. While the tone of writing about the end of this world speaks about condemnation, it is implicitly intended to product hope for the faithful. This implies that it is the faithful who are the subject of these writings even though they more often address the unbeliever. While it is desired that the unbeliever comes to repentance, it is assumed that number of those who repent will be exceedingly small. These writings are also distinct from prophecy because they are not meant to be easily understood. Instead, they are to remain mysterious and require discernment from the spiritually mature believer. 

They often have concepts or terms that are supposed to function as “polar” opposites. 

It mysterious nature is not supposed to be understood and the translator will need to leave many aspects of the book appear confusing. This is especially true when the events themselves appear otherworldly or impossible. 


Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah and Revelation should really be translated together or be studied together to correlate well with one another
symbols function to encourage believers that justice will eventually come and to draw unbelievers to repentance.
