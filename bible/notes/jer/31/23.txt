\v 23 Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the
cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity: Jehovah bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of
holiness.
\v 24 And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together, the husbandmen, and they that go about with flocks.
\v 25 For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.
\v 26 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet to me.
