\v 11 So what I suggest is that you summon all the Israelite soldiers, from Dan \add in the far north\add* to Beersheba \add in the far south\add*. They will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore \f + \ft hyperbole \f*. And then you yourself lead us into the battle.
\v 12 We will find \add your father\add*, wherever he is, and we will attack him \add from all sides\add*, like \f + \ft simile \f* dew covers all the ground. And neither he nor any of the soldiers who are with him will survive.

\v 11 But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan all the way to Beersheba, as numerous as the sand that is by the sea, and that you go to battle in person.
\v 12 Then we will come upon him in some place where he will be found, and we will cover him as the dew falls on the ground. We will not leave even one of his men, or he himself, alive.
