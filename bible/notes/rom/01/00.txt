=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

==  The gospel ==
This chapter refers to the contents of the book of Romans as, "this is the gospel" ([[:en:bible:notes:rom:1:1|1:2]]). Romans is not a gospel like Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Chapters 1-8 are a presentation of the gospel, that Jesus died for the sins of mankind and was raised again as proof of eternal life for those who believe in him. 

== Fruit ==
The imagery of fruit is used in this chapter. The image of fruit is usually the outworking of one's faith in producing acts of [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]] in a person's life. Here it is used to talk about the positive result of Paul's future visit to Rome in the lives of the Roman Christians. 

== Universal Condemnation and the Wrath of God==
This chapter explains that the whole world is without excuse and has enough knowledge to seek after and believe in the true God, Yahweh. Because of man's [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] and depravity, all of mankind is deserving of a punishment of death to appease the wrath of God. This wrath was satisfied by the death of Jesus.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "God gave them over" ==
Many scholars view the phrases "God gave them over" and "God gave them up" as theologically significant. For this reason, it is likely important to translate these phrase with God playing a passive role in this action. God simply allows man to pursue their own desires, he does not force them.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Difficult phrases and concepts ==

There are many abstract concepts in this chapter and Paul's personal style makes many of the phrases in this chapter difficult to translate. The translator may need to use the UDB to understand the meaning of the phrases and it may be necessary to use more freedom in translating these phrases. The difficult phrases include: "obedience of faith," "whom I serve in my spirit," "from faith to faith" and "exchanged the glory of the imperishable God for the likenesses of an image of perishable man."
