    * **make merry**  - or, "have a party", or "celebrate"
    * **devoured your living**  - or, "consumed entirely", or, " ate until there was nothing left".
    * **fattened calf**  - see Luke 15:25-27
    * **your son**- or, "that son of yours". The older son relinquishes any ties with the younger son. He distances himself from his brother and cannot understand why his father is acting this way
