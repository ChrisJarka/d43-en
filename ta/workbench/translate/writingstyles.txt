====== Writing Styles ======

Also known as 'Discourse.' The term “discourse” refers to how the parts of a text are organized and connected in order to clearly and naturally communicate the correct meaning of a text. In every translation, the way that words, sentences, and paragraphs are arranged will affect how the message will be understood.

==== Kinds of Writing Styles ====

  * **Narrative** or **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]]** - tells a story or event
  * **Explanatory** - explains facts or teaches principles
  * **Procedural** - tells how to do something
  * **Argumentative** - tries to persuade someone to do something
  * **[[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]]** - expresses ideas and feelings in a beautiful way
  * **[[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]]** - briefly teaches a truth or wisdom

The purpose of a particular text will influence what kinds of discourse features are used. For example, in a narrative, discourse features would include:

  * telling about events that happen before or after other events;
  * introducing people in the story;
  * introducing new events in the story;
  * conversation and the use of quotes;
  * referring to people and things with either a noun or a pronoun.

Languages have organized ways of communicating information in each of these discourse types.
====Discourse Groupings====

  * **Grammatical groupings**: This deals with how language units such as sentences and paragraphs are linked together to from larger units. Transition words and phrases that connect smaller units to form larger units are one type of discourse feature. Some common grammatical units are phrase, sentence, paragraph, and episode.

  *  **Plot-related groupings**: This includes how the story begins, how it transitions from one event to the next and how it communicates the climax or ending of the story.

==== Specific discourse issues: ====    

  - **[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]]** - Phrases like “One day” or “It came about that” or “This is how it happened” or “Sometime after that” signal to the reader that a new event is about to be related.
  - **[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_quotations]]** - All languages have specific patterns that are natural for reporting what someone said. 
  - **Pronoun reference system** - Languages have a certain pattern of how frequently to  use pronouns. If that pattern is not followed, wrong meaning can result.
  - **[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]]** = An author may use background information for several reasons: 1) to add interest to the story, 2) to provide important historical or cultural information or 3) to tell the reader, or listener, something very important.
  - **[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_connectingwords]]** - Every language has certain patterns for how connecting words (such as “and, ”“but.” or “then”) are used. 
  - **Relative prominence or emphasis** - Languages have different ways of showing which parts of a sentence, paragraph, or story are being emphasized the most. This is called “prominence” which refers to how the language shows what is important or what is being emphasized.
