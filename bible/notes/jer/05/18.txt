<usfm>
\v 18 But even in those days—this is Yahweh's declaration—I do not intend to destroy you completely.
\v 19 When you, Israel and Judah, say, 'Why has Yahweh our God done all these things to us?' then you, Jeremiah, will say to them, 'Just as you abandoned Yahweh and served foreign gods in your land, so you must also serve strangers in a land that is not your own.'
