===== Share Your Work =====

This module answers the question: How do I share my work?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[https://door43.org/en/ta/vol1/tech/ts_create|Create and Edit Text]]

You can share your work on DokuWiki, send it to another device, or put it on an SD card. When your work is on a storage card, you can put it on a computer or device that has the translationStudio app.
**Note: ** You can only move or share the changes that have been made on the device you are using to perform this function. In these instructions, "your work" means any changes made on this device.
To share, move, or store your work, complete these steps:
  - In the green bar at the top of the screen, tap the three dots on the right.
  - In the list of options, tap **Share**.
  - At the **Sharing **  screen, select what you want to do.
      - Tap **Export to app**  to export your work to DocuWiki.
      - Tap **Export to SD Card**  to move your work onto the SD card inserted into your device. This function will not work if no SD card is inserted into the device.
      - Tap **Export to a nearby device**  to send your work to a nearby device that has translationStudio installed on it.
        - The app will attempt to locate the device. If it continues searching for more than a minute, exit the screen and verify that the devices are paired through Bluetooth.
  - When you are finished, tap the arrow on the left of the green bar to return to the translation screen.
