\v 36 But Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, you must fear, and to him will you bow yourselves, and to him will you sacrifice,
\v 37 and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do forevermore. So you must not fear other gods,
