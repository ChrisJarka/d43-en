====== angel ======

===== Definition: =====

An angel is a powerful spirit being whom God created. These spirit beings exist to serve God by doing whatever he tells them to do.

  * Angels serve God in different ways:
      * They give people messages from God, including commands and other instructions.
      * They protect and strengthen people.
      * They guard people and places.
  * Note that the phrase "angel of Yahweh" may sometimes refer to God himself.

The opposite of "angel" is a "demon."
