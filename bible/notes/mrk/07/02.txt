===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For the Pharisees and all the Jews, do not eat unless they wash their hands thoroughly**- The Jews approach eating as an act of faith and obedience, so they needed to be ceremonially clean by washing, and needed to eat only food the Law deemed ceremonially clean.
