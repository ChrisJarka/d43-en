\v 3 He came to the sheep pen on the way, where there was a cave. Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave.
\v 4 David's men said to him, "Here is the day of which Yahweh told you, 'Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand for you to deal with as it seems good to you.'" Then David stood up and secretly cut off the corner of Saulâ€™s robe.
