\v 26 You therefore must keep my commandments and my laws, and you must not do any of this wickedness, neither the native-born Israelite nor the foreigner who sojourns among you,
\v 27 for all this wickedness have  the men of the land done, who lived here before you, and the land is defiled.
\v 28 So obey Yahweh that the land will not vomit you out also, so you will not defile it and be vomited out like  the nations who were before you.
