What is translation? Translation is the process of representing in one language (the "project language") the ideas found in a document (the "source text") written in a different language.

Why do translators do this? Translators can have different reasons for doing their work. In the case of Bible translation, people usually do their work because they want the Bible's ideas to affect the project language readers in the same way that the original readers and hearers of the biblical texts were affected. Because God's ideas in the Bible lead us to eternal life with him, translators also want project language readers to know his ideas.

How does the Bible translator usually expect to represent the biblical ideas? There are various ways in which we can represent the ideas in a source text: we can put them into a list, we can summarize them using far less space on the written page, we can simplify them (as we often do in children's Bible story books), or we can even put them into a diagram or chart of some kind. However, most Bible translators try to present the biblical ideas as completely as possible. They try to produce in translation same kind of document as the original documents (a prophecy for a prophecy, a letter for a letter, etc.) Also, they try to create the same tensions in the translation that exist in the source texts: plot, lines of argument, sequences of thought, etc. 

What do we mean by "tension" in texts? Examples of tension occur when a reader wonders what will happen next to the participants in a story, or when a reader follows the argument, encouragement, and warnings of an epistle writer or of a conversation that is reported in the text. A reader can feel tension when reading a psalm, for example, since the praises of God affect the psalmist in various ways. When reading an Old Testament prophetic book, the reader can feel tension rise as the prophet condemns people for their sin, or as he warns them to turn back to God. And the reader can feel tension as he reads about God's promises for the future, and as he tries to learn about the fulfillment of those promises. Good translators observe the kinds of tension in the source documents, and they try to reproduce that tension in the project language.

How should translators use the ULB and UDB in these tasks?
