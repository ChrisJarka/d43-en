====== translationNotes that Explain ======

==== Description =====

Sometimes you may not know what a word in the ULB means. Sometimes the same word or phrase is also used in the UDB, so the notes have an explanation of the word or phrase. 


==== Translation Notes Examples ====

Simple explanations about words or phrases are in sentence format. For example:
> The fishermen had gotten out of them and were __washing their nets__. (Luke 5:2 ULB)

  * **washing their nets**  - They were cleaning their fishing nets in order to use them again to catch fish.

> they __motioned__ to their partners in the other boat  (Luke 5:7 ULB)

  * **motioned**  - They were too far from shore to call so they made gestures, probably waving their arms.


==== Translation Principles ====  
  * Use words that are already part of your language if possible.
  * Keep expressions short if possible.
  * Represent God's commands and historical facts accurately.
