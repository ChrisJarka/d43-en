  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **In the beginning**  - before humans and creation existed; in the beginning of the world
  * **the heavens and the earth**  - The word "heavens" here refers to the sky. These words are used together to mean "the universe".
  * **without form and empty**  - The world was in chaos and God had not yet put it in order or given it a purpose and a function.
  * **empty**  - There was nothing on the earth.
  * **waters**  - In Hebrew, the word for "water" is always expressed as a plural word. If your language does not do this, or it would be confusing to use the plural, simply "the water" is another way to translate this word.
