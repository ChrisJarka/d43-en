====== James 01 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Temptation and testing==
There is some significant differences between the meaning of temptation here ([[:en:bible:notes:jas:01:12|1:13]]) and God "testing" man in ([[:en:bible:notes:heb:11:17|Hebrews 11:17]]). 

== Crowns ==
Crowns are a significant image used in Scripture. There are several Greek words translated as crowns in English. The crown referenced here is a type of [[:en:obe:kt:reward|reward]].

== Light ==
Light is an important image used in Scripture. It is always used in a positive manner.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
James uses many [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] in this chapter. It helps to give his instructions a gentile, pastoral tone.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "God is not tempted" ==
This passage is difficult to understand in light of the fact that Jesus was "tempted" in the desert and is God. While Jesus was tempted by Satan, he was not tempted. There is an important difference in the passive and active voice in this description. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]).

== "To the twelve tribes in dispersion" ==
It appears that the author wrote this letter to Christian, but he also uses this phrase. There is uncertainty as to its meaning. Given that the author gives many practical instructions for holy living, it is unlikely that the author is referring to Jews who are not also Christians.
