=== Translation Principles === 

Using the Bible terms can show that the Bible is true and that people actually used these units of measure during that time period.

==== Translation Strategies =====

  - Keep the Bible term and spell it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  - State the amount using a unit of measure that is known.
  - Use the Bible term and give the equivalent amount in the text or a note.

=== measure ===  
Sometimes the Hebrew does not specify a particular unit of volume but only uses a number. In these cases, many English versions, and the ULB and UDB, add the word "measure." For example in Haggai 2:16 it has, "twenty (measures) of grain" and "fifty (measures) of wine."

Translation suggestions when the unit of measure is implied:
  - Translate literally, using the number without giving a unit.\\
  - Use a generic word like "measure" or "quantity" or "portion." \\ 
  - Use the name of an appropriate container, such as "basket" for grain and "jar" for wine. \\ 
  - Use a unit of measure that you are already using in your translation.
