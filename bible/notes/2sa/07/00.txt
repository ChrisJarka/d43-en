====== 2 Samuel 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This is the finishing of the small interruption about the [[:en:obe:kt:houseofgod|House of God]].

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

David wanted to honor God by building him a temple. God told David that he would not build it but his son would build it. 

== Covenant of David ==
God made a [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenant]] with David that was not conditioned upon anything David or his descendants did. God promised that one of David's descendants would rule Israel forever. Because Israel would not have a king in the future, this promise did not begin at this time. The descendant, who would rule forever, is Jesus.
