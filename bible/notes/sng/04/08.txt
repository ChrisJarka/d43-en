===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The man continues to speak to the woman. He speaks of them not being free to make love as if they were in a wild, dangerous, foreign place.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **from Lebanon** - "away from Lebanon"
  * **my bride** - This Hebrew word can refer to a woman who is married or to one whom a man has arranged to become his son's wife. If your language has a polite word that a man would use to his wife and that has not been used yet in this book, you could use it here. Otherwise you could use any polite term a man would use with his wife.
  * **Amana** - the name of a mountain north of Israel (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
