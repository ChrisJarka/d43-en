===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 13 If any of you thinks that you are wise and know much, you should always act in a good way to show people that your good deeds are the result of your being truly wise. Being wise helps us to act gently toward others. \v 14 But if you are very envious of other people and lie against them and do them wrong, you should not pretend that you are wise. By boasting like that you are saying that what is true is actually false. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Who among you is wise and understanding? Let that person** - This is a rhetorical question James is using to teach and possibly rebuke his audience. Also, "wise and understanding" is a doublet. This could be translated as "The person who thinks he is wise should." (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]] and [[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
  * **demonstrate a good life** - "show it" or "prove it"
  * **by his works in the humility that comes from wisdom** - "with his good deeds and humility that comes from having true wisdom"
  * **have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart**  - Here "heart" is a metonym that refers to emotions or thoughts. This could be translated as "will not share with others and you always put yourself first." ([[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **do not boast and lie against the truth**  - "do not lie about it and act like your are wise."
