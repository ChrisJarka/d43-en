== Vengeance ==

The theme of vengeance is important in this chapter. Ancient Hebrew society allowed for people to seek revenge if a close relative was murdered. Cain thought that he would be helpless against this danger because he had been driven away from God's protection, after he murdered Abel, his brother.

The theme of vengeance continues with the words of Lamech, who killed someone for injuring him.
