\v 12 Josiah also commanded his servants to tear down the altars that the previous kings of Judah had built on the roof of the palace, above the room where King Ahaz had stayed. They also tore down the altars that had been built by King Manasseh in the two courtyards outside the temple. He commanded that they be smashed to pieces and thrown down into the Kidron Valley.
\v 13 He also commanded that the altars that King Solomon had built east of Jerusalem, south of Olive Tree Hill, be desecrated. Solomon had built them for the worship of the disgusting idols—the \add statue of the goddess\add* Astarte \add worshiped by the people in\add* Sidon \add city\add*, Chemosh the god of the Moab people-group, and Molech the god of the Ammon people-group.
\v 14 They also broke into pieces the stone pillars that the Israelite people worshiped, and cut down the \add pillars that honored the goddess\add* Asherah, and they scattered the ground there with human bones \add to desecrate it\add*.

\v 12 And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars
which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah, did the king break down, and beat
them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
\v 13 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon
the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for
Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
\v 14 And he brake in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men.
