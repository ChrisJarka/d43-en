==== Description ====
In common English, “possession” refers to having something, or to something that a person has. In grammar, **possession** refers to a grammatical relationship between two nouns. In English that grammatical relationship is shown with "of," or an apostrophe and the letter "s," or a possessive pronoun. 

  * the house __of__ my grandfather
  * my grandfather__'s__ house

Possession is used in Hebrew, Greek, and English for a variety of situations. Here are a few common ones.

    * my mother -  the woman who gave birth to me, or the woman who cared for me
    * my teacher - the person who teaches me

  * Contents - Something has something in it.
    * a bag of potatoes - a bag that has potatoes in it, or a bag that is full of potatoes

  *  Part of a whole: One thing is part of another.
      * my head - the head that is part of my body
      * the roof of a house - the roof that is part of a house
    
=== Reasons this is a translation issue ===

  * Translators need to understand the relationship between two nouns when one possesses the other.
  * Some languages do not use possession for all of the situations that possession is used for in the source text of the the Bible.
