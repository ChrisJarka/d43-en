====== Punctuation ======

We have decided to use "American-style" punctuation. For this project, that means:

  * Final punctuation should be included inside the quotation marks. (Ex. He said, "What are you doing?")
  * Use a comma before the "and" in a string of items. (Ex. the length, height, and depth of the box.)
  * Use a comma after “and” to separate items in a list. This will distinguish an appositive phrase from items in a list.

I invited my friends, Dave and Paul. (appositive phrase) \\ I invited my friends, Dave, and Paul. (items in a list)

  * Use a colon between the chapter and verse on a Bible reference (Luke 1:2-5)
  * Add double-quotation marks for direct speech, and single-quotation marks for quotations within quotations.
  * When referring to a term in a note, add double-quotes around the term to set it off from the other text (Ex. The meaning of "grace" is…).
  * When writing a string of translation alternatives separated by "or" do not use commas between the phrases. (Ex. That is, "one time" or "the next" or "all at once.")
  * Do **not **  use a comma when introducing a note with "This can be translated as …"
  * Do **not **  use the colon (**:**) in the ULB or UDB. Many MTTs are unfamiliar with the colon and its use. This request will require editing out a good many colons from the ASV-based text. If you want to use a colon, as in “He sent them a gift: nuts, figs, and skins of wine,” then rephrase it to “He sent them a gift. It was nuts, figs, and skins of wine.”
  * Colons are used in the translation notes and the key terms pages, both in sentences and in cross-references.
  * A. (See also**:**  Sarah, Isaac)
  * B. **Jerusalem surrounded by armies**  - This can be expressed with an active verb**:**  “armies surrounding Jerusalem.” (See**:**  Active or Passive)
  * Hyphens: contrary to the ASV style, do not hyphenate Biblical names except in unusual circumstances. For example, change the ASV's "Beth-lehem" to "Bethlehem," and "Ben-oni" to "Benoni."
  * You can use the m-dash judiciously in order to separate an anacoluthon from the rest of the sentence. Here are two examples, "God, I thank you that I am not like other men–robbers, evildoers, adulterers–or even like this tax collector" (Luke 18:11 NIV); "An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs–how he can please the Lord" (1 Cor. 7:32 NIV). In each of these examples, the anacoluthon explains the sense of the expression that precedes it. At other times, an anacoluthon is handy for presenting the real topic of a sentence when the topic is distinct from the subject of the clause which follows, e.g., "You who boast saying, 'I have God's laws'– it is disgusting that you disobey those same laws!" (Rom. 2:23 TfT, which uses a comma here where an m-dash is very appropriate). Note, however, that the NIV often uses the m-dash when it adds nothing of value to the sentence, e.g., "No one is good–except God alone" (Luke 18:19 NIV). This is no improvement over "No one is good except God alone." As you know, one produces an m-dash in Word for Windows by typing two hyphens and then by typing a word with no intervening space. These key-strokes do not work in Etherpad, which instead merely displays two hyphens. Nevertheless, we trust that Door43 wil display the m-dash correctly.
