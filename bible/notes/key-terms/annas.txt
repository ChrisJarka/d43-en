====== Annas ======

===== Facts: =====

Annas was the Jewish high priest in Jerusalem for 10 years, from approximately AD 6 to 15. Then <font 14px line-height: 15.6800003051758px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>he was removed from the high priesthood by the Roman government, although he continued to be an influential leader among the Jews.</font>

  * <font 14px line-height: 15.6800003051758px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Annas was father-in-law to</font>    Caiaphas<font 14px line-height: 15.6800003051758px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>, the high priest during the ministry of Jesus.</font>
  * Jesus was initially brought to Annas for questioning during his trial, even though it was Caiaphas who was officially the high priest at that time.
  * <font 14px line-height: 15.6800003051758px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>After high priests retired, they still kept the title, along with some of the responsibilities of the office, so Annas was still referred to as high priest during the priesthood of Caiaphas and others.</font>
