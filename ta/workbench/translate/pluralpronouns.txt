This module answers the question: What are English plural pronouns?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech|English Parts of Speech]]

Plural pronouns replace plural nouns â€” those that name more than one person, place, thing, or idea.
==== Dual Pronouns: ====
Unlike some languages, English does not have //Dual Personal Pronouns//, which refer to two people only. If clarification is necessary, expressions like the following are used:
   * //1st Person Dual//: **us two ** or **us both ** or** both of us**  - these phrases can be [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive|exclusive]] or [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|inclusive]] based on context
  * //1st Person Dual//: **you and I**  - this phrase is strictly [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|inclusive]]
  * //2nd Person Dual//: **you two**  or **you both**  or **both of you**
  * //3rd Person Dual//: **these two**  or **those two**
==== Plural Personal Pronouns: ====
English has two distinct //Plural Personal Pronouns//:
   * //1st Person Plural Pronoun//: **we**  or **us**  - (from //Singular - **I **  or //**me**) these words can be [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive|exclusive]] or [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive|inclusive ]]based on context
  * //3rd Person Plural Pronoun//: **they**  or **them**  (from //Singular -//**he **  or** him**  or **she**  or **her**  or **it**)
In Standard English, **you **  can be either //Singular //  or //Plural//  based on context. For clarification, 'all' is used to form expressions like "you all" or "all of you" in specifying //2nd Person Plurality//.\\
