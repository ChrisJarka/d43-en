The Church has many different parts with different functions making up just one church. All of the different parts are necessary. Each part has empathy and concern for all the other parts, even those that seem less important.

**Metaphors**

Almost the whole chapter is an extended [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]: The Church is like a body because it has many different parts each with a different but important function.
Experiencing the same Holy Spirit in our lives is like "drinking of one Spirit" because we all experience it.
