\v 10 And herein I give my judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.
\v 11 But now complete the doing also; that as there was the readiness to will, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.
\v 12 For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according as a man has, not according as he has not.
