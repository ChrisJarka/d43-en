\v 12 But \add there is one problem\add*. Although it is true that I am a close relative \add of your mother's dead husband\add*, there is another man who is a closer relative \add than I am\add*, and therefore he should be the one to \add marry you and\add* take care of you.
\v 13 You stay here for the rest of this night. Tomorrow morning \add I will tell this man about you\add*. If he says that he will \add marry you and\add* take are of you, fine, \add we will\add* let him do that. But if he is not willing \add to do that\add*, I solemnly promise that as surely as Yahweh lives, I will \add marry you and\add* take are of you.

\v 12 But there is one problem. Although it is true that I am a close relative of your mother's dead husband, there is another man who is an even closer relative than I am, and therefore he is really the one who is responsible for you.
\v 13 You stay here for the rest of the night. Tomorrow morning I will tell this man about you. If he says that he will take responsibility for you, fine, we will let him marry you. But if he is not willing to do that, I solemnly promise that as surely as Yahweh lives, I will marry you and take care of you. So stay here until it is morning."

v 14 So she lay at his feet until morning. But she got up and left before it was light enough that people would be able to recognize her, because Boaz said, "It would be best if no one knows that a woman was here."

\v 12 Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is a kinsman nearer than I.
\v 13 Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he will perform for you the part of a kinsman, good, let him do the kinsman's part. But if he will not do the part of a kinsman for you, then I will do the part of a kinsman for you, by the life of Yahweh. Lie down until the morning."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the part of a kinsman**  - Or, "marry you and father children for your dead husband." One duty of a kinsman was to keep alive the name of a male relative who died without children by marrying the widow, fathering children, and naming them after the dead man.
