===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Therefore Yahweh will raise up against him, Rezin, his adversary** - The meaning of this phrase is not clear.  Judah had susessfully sought the help of Assyria in defeating Rezin, King of Syria.  However, Assyria then destroyed the northern kingdom of Israel and threatened to destroy the southern kingdom of Judah.  Assyria would probably have succeeded in destroying Judah, but the Babylonians arrived and took the people into captivity.  The references to "him" and "his" are also unclear.  (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:ambiguity]]). Alternate translation: "Because the people of Judah have sinned, the Lord will punish them by bringing the Assyrians, King Rezin's enemies, to destroy Judah." 
  * **and will stir up his enemies the Arameans on the east, and the Philistines on the west.** - Alternate translation: "The Assyrians will stir up Judah's enemies, the Arameans to the east and the Philistines to the west."  (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]]) 
  * **They will devour Israel with open mouth** - Isaiah compares Judah's enemies to wild beasts who will tear apart and eat the people of Judah.  (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metaphor]]. 
  * **will devout Israel** - "Israel" was the name which the Lord gave Jacob, grandson of Abraham, father of the Lord's chosen people.  "Israel" was also the name of the unified nation of the Lord's people under Kings Saul, David, and Solomon.  "Israel" was also the name of the northern kingdom after the unified kingdom split into two regions.  Sometimes Isaiah also refers to the people of Judah, the southern kingdom, as "Israel" because they once belonged to the unified nation.  The name of a kingdom or nation is a metonym for the people of that kingdom or nation.  ([[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metonymy]]
  * **his hand will still be stretched out to strike** - The word "his" refers to the Lord.  Alternate translation: "he will stretch out his had and stirke his people."  Here "hand" is a metonym for the Lord.  (See [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metonymy]] and [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:personification]])
