\v 3 For I truly, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged him who has done this thing just as though I were present. 
\v 4 In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are gathered together with my spirit and with the power of our Lord Jesus,
\v 5 deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.  So that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
