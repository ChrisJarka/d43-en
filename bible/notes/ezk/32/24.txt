\v 24 There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down
uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame
with them that go down to the pit.
\v 25 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about her; all of them
uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with
them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that are slain.
