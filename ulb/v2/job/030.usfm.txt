\c 30
\b
\q
\v 1 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,
\q Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
\q
\v 2 Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me?
\q Men in whom ripe age is perished.
\q
\v 3 They are gaunt with lack and famine;
\q They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.
\q
\v 4 They pluck salt-wort by the bushes;
\q And the roots of the broom are their food.
\q
\v 5 They are driven forth from the midst of men;
\q They cry after them as after a thief;
\q
\v 6 So that they dwell in frightful valleys,
\q In holes of the earth and of the rocks.
\q
\v 7 Among the bushes they bray;
\q Under the nettles they are gathered together.
\q
\v 8 They are children of fools, yea, children of base men;
\q They were scourged out of the land.
\b
\q
\v 9 And now I am become their song,
\q Yea, I am a byword to them.
\q
\v 10 They abhor me, they stand aloof from me,
\q And spare not to spit in my face.
\q
\v 11 For he has loosed his cord, and afflicted me;
\q And they have cast off the bridle before me.
\q
\v 12 Upon my right hand rise the rabble;
\q They thrust aside my feet,
\q And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.
\q
\v 13 They mar my path,
\q They set forward my calamity,
\q Even men that have no helper.
\q
\v 14 As through a wide breach they come:
\q In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me.
\q
\v 15 Terrors are turned upon me;
\q They chase mine honor as the wind;
\q And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.
\b
\q
\v 16 And now my soul is poured out within me;
\q Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
\q
\v 17 In the night season my bones are pierced in me,
\q And the pains that gnaw me take no rest.
\q
\v 18 By Godâ€™s great force is my garment disfigured;
\q It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
\q
\v 19 He has cast me into the mire,
\q And I am become like dust and ashes.
\q
\v 20 I cry to thee, and you do not answer me:
\q I stand up, and you gazest at me.
\q
\v 21 You are turned to be cruel to me;
\q With the might of your hand you persecutest me.
\q
\v 22 You lift me up to the wind, you cause me to ride upon
it;
\q And you dissolvest me in the storm.
\q
\v 23 For I know that you will bring me to death,
\q And to the house appointed for all living.
\b
\q
\v 24 Howbeit does not one stretch out the hand in his fall?
\q Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?
\q
\v 25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?
\q Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
\q
\v 26 When I looked for good, then evil came;
\q And when I waited for light, there came darkness.
\q
\v 27 My heart is troubled, and rests not;
\q Days of affliction are come upon me.
\q
\v 28 I go mourning without the sun:
\q I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.
\q
\v 29 I am a brother to jackals,
\q And a companion to ostriches.
\q
\v 30 My skin is black, and falls from me,
\q And my bones are burned with heat.
\q
\v 31 Therefore is my harp turned to mourning,
\q And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.
