\v 3 He said to them, "Tell this to Isaiah: King Hezekiah says that this is a day when we have great distress\f + \ft Or: trouble \f*. \add Other nations are causing\add* us to be insulted and disgraced. We are like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a woman who is about to give birth to a child, but she does not have the strength that she needs to do it.
\v 4 Perhaps Yahweh our God has heard everything that the official from Assyria said. Perhaps he knows that His boss\f + \ft Or: master \f*, the king of Assyria, sent him to insult the all-powerful God, and that Yahweh will rebuke\f + \ft Or: punish \f* him for what he said.

\v 3 And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the
children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
\v 4 It may be Jehovah your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the
living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah your God has heard: wherefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.
