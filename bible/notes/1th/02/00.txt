====== 1 Thessalonians 02 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Christian witness ==
Paul values his "christian [[:en:obe:kt:witness|witness]]" as evidence for the truth of the gospel. The  [[:en:obe:kt:godly|godliness]] or [[:en:obe:kt:holy|holiness]] of a Christian is said to bear witness to the non-Christian. Paul defends himself against attacks against his character, so that his witness is not tainted.

== Christian living ==
Under the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]], people were required to offer sacrifices of animals or grain in the temple. Since physical sacrifices are no longer required, Christians are required to live their lives as a type of sacrifice to God.
