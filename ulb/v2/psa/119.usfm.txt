\q
\v 1 Blessed are they that are perfect in the way,
\q Who walk in the law of Jehovah.
\q
\v 2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies,
\q That seek him with the whole heart.
\q
\v 3 Yea, they do no unrighteousness;
\q They walk in his ways.
\q
\v 4 You have commanded us your precepts,
\q That we should observe them diligently.
\q
\v 5 Oh that my ways were established
\q To observe your statutes!
\q
\v 6 Then shall I not be put to shame,
\q When I have respect to all your commandments.
\q
\v 7 I will give thanks to you with uprightness of heart,
\q When I learn your righteous judgments.
\q
\v 8 I will observe your statutes:
\q Oh forsake me not utterly.
\d BETH.
\q
\v 9 Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way?
\q By taking heed thereto according to your word.
\q
\v 10 With my whole heart have I sought thee:
\q Oh let me not wander from your commandments.
\q
\v 11 Your word have I laid up in my heart,
\q That I might not sin against thee.
\q
\v 12 Blessed are thou, O Jehovah:
\q Teach me your statutes.
\q
\v 13 With my lips have I declared
\q All the ordinances of your mouth.
\q
\v 14 I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies,
\q As much as in all riches.
\q
\v 15 I will meditate on your precepts,
\q And have respect to your ways.
\q
\v 16 I will delight myself in your statutes:
\q I will not forget your word.
\d GIMEL.
\q
\v 17 Deal bountifully with your servant, that I may live;
\q So will I observe your word.
\q
\v 18 Open you mine eyes, that I may behold
\q Wondrous things out of your law.
\q
\v 19 I am a sojourner in the earth:
\q Hide not your commandments from me.
\q
\v 20 My soul breaks for the longing
\q That it has to your ordinances at all times.
\q
\v 21 You have rebuked the proud that are cursed,
\q That do wander from your commandments.
\q
\v 22 Take away from me reproach and contempt;
\q For I have kept your testimonies.
\q
\v 23 Princes also sat and talked against me;
\q But your servant did meditate on your statutes.
\q
\v 24 Your testimonies also are my delight
\q And my counsellors.
\d DALETH.
\q
\v 25 My soul clings to the dust:
\q Quicken you me according to your word.
\q
\v 26 I declared my ways, and you answeredst me:
\q Teach me your statutes.
\q
\v 27 Make me to understand the way of your precepts:
\q So shall I meditate on your wondrous works.
\q
\v 28 My soul melteth for heaviness:
\q Strengthen you me according to your word.
\q
\v 29 Remove from me the way of falsehood;
\q And grant me your law graciously.
\q
\v 30 I have chosen the way of faithfulness:
\q Your ordinances have I set before me.
\q
\v 31 I cleave to your testimonies:
\q O Jehovah, put me not to shame.
\q
\v 32 I will run the way of your commandments,
\q When you shall enlarge my heart.
\d HE.
\q
\v 33 Teach me, O Jehovah, the way of your statutes;
\q And I shall keep it to the end.
\q
\v 34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep your law;
\q Yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.
\q
\v 35 Make me to go in the path of your commandments;
\q For therein do I delight.
\q
\v 36 Incline my heart to your testimonies,
\q And not to covetousness.
\q
\v 37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity,
\q And quicken me in your ways.
\q
\v 38 Confirm to your servant your word,
\q Which is in order to the fear of thee.
\q
\v 39 Turn away my reproach whereof I am afraid;
\q For your ordinances are good.
\q
\v 40 Behold, I have longed after your precepts:
\q Quicken me in your righteousness.
\d VAV.
\q
\v 41 Let your lovingkindnesses also come to me, O Jehovah,
\q Even your salvation, according to your word.
\q
\v 42 So shall I have an answer for him that reproaches me;
\q For I trust in your word.
\q
\v 43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth;
\q For I have hoped in your ordinances.
\q
\v 44 So shall I observe your law continually
\q For ever and ever.
\q
\v 45 And I shall walk at liberty;
\q For I have sought your precepts.
\q
\v 46 I will also speak of your testimonies before kings,
\q And shall not be put to shame.
\q
\v 47 And I will delight myself in your commandments,
\q Which I have loved.
\q
\v 48 I will lift up my hands also to your commandments, which I have loved;
\q And I will meditate on your statutes.
\d ZAYIN.
\q
\v 49 Remember the word to your servant,
\q Because you have made me to hope.
\q
\v 50 This is my comfort in my affliction;
\q For your word has quickened me.
\q
\v 51 The proud have had me greatly in derision:
\q Yet have I not swerved from your law.
\q
\v 52 I have remembered your ordinances of old, O Jehovah,
\q And have comforted myself.
\q
\v 53 Hot indignation has taken hold upon me,
\q Because of the wicked that forsake your law.
\q
\v 54 Your statutes have been my songs
\q In the house of my pilgrimage.
\q
\v 55 I have remembered your name, O Jehovah, in the night,
\q And have observed your law.
\q
\v 56 This I have had,
\q Because I have kept your precepts.
\b
\d HHETH.
\q
\v 57 Jehovah is my portion:
\q I have said that I would observe your words.
\q
\v 58 I entreated your favor with my whole heart:
\q Be merciful to me according to your word.
\q
\v 59 I thought on my ways,
\q And turned my feet to your testimonies.
\q
\v 60 I made haste, and delayed not,
\q To observe your commandments.
\q
\v 61 The cords of the wicked have wrapped me round;
\q But I have not forgotten your law.
\q
\v 62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you
\q Because of your righteous ordinances.
\q
\v 63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee,
\q And of them that observe your precepts.
\q
\v 64 The earth, O Jehovah, is full of your lovingkindness:
\q Teach me your statutes.
\b
\d TETH.
\q
\v 65 You have dealt well with your servant,
\q O Jehovah, according to your word.
\q
\v 66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge;
\q For I have believed in your commandments.
\q
\v 67 Before I was afflicted I went astray;
\q But now I observe your word.
\q
\v 68 You are good, and do good;
\q Teach me your statutes.
\q
\v 69 The proud have forged a lie against me:
\q With my whole heart will I keep your precepts.
\q
\v 70 Their heart is as fat as grease;
\q But I delight in your law.
\q
\v 71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted;
\q That I may learn your statutes.
\q
\v 72 The law of your mouth is better to me
\q Than thousands of gold and silver.
\b
\d YODH.
\q
\v 73 Your hands have made me and fashioned me:
\q Give me understanding, that I may learn your commandments.
\q
\v 74 They that fear you shall see me and be glad,
\q Because I have hoped in your word.
\q
\v 75 I know, O Jehovah, that your judgments are righteous,
\q And that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
\q
\v 76 Let, I pray thee, your lovingkindness be for my comfort,
\q According to your word to your servant.
\q
\v 77 Let your tender mercies come to me, that I may live;
\q For your law is my delight.
\q
\v 78 Let the proud be put to shame;
\q For they have overthrown me wrongfully:
\q But I will meditate on your precepts.
\q
\v 79 Let those that fear you turn to me;
\q And they shall know your testimonies.
\q
\v 80 Let my heart be perfect in your statutes,
\q That I be not put to shame.
\b
\d KAPH.
\q
\v 81 My soul fainteth for your salvation;
\q But I hope in your word.
\q
\v 82 Mine eyes fail for your word,
\q While I say, When will you comfort me?
\q
\v 83 For I am become like a wine-skin in the smoke;
\q Yet do I not forget your statutes.
\q
\v 84 How many are the days of your servant?
\q When will you execute judgment on them that persecute me?
\q
\v 85 The proud have digged pits for me,
\q Who are not according to your law.
\q
\v 86 All your commandments are faithful:
\q They persecute me wrongfully; help you me.
\q
\v 87 They had almost consumed me upon earth;
\q But I forsook not your precepts.
\q
\v 88 Quicken me after your lovingkindness;
\q So shall I observe the testimony of your mouth.
\b
\d LAMEDH.
\q
\v 89 For ever, O Jehovah,
\q Your word is settled in heaven.
\q
\v 90 Your faithfulness is to all generations:
\q You have established the earth, and it abideth.
\q
\v 91 They abide this day according to your ordinances;
\q For all things are your servants.
\q
\v 92 Unless your law had been my delight,
\q I should then have perished in mine affliction.
\q
\v 93 I will never forget your precepts;
\q For with them you have quickened me.
\q
\v 94 I am thine, save me;
\q For I have sought your precepts.
\q
\v 95 The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me;
\q But I will consider your testimonies.
\q
\v 96 I have seen an end of all perfection;
\q But your commandment is exceeding broad.
\b
\d MEM.
\q
\v 97 Oh how love I your law!
\q It is my meditation all the day.
\q
\v 98 Your commandments make me wiser than mine enemies;
\q For they are ever with me.
\q
\v 99 I have more understanding than all my teachers;
\q For your testimonies are my meditation.
\q
\v 100 I understand more than the aged,
\q Because I have kept your precepts.
\q
\v 101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way,
\q That I might observe your word.
\q
\v 102 I have not turned aside from your ordinances;
\q For you have taught me.
\q
\v 103 How sweet are your words to my taste!
\q Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
\q
\v 104 Through your precepts I get understanding:
\q Therefore I hate every false way.
\b
\d NUN.
\q
\v 105 Your word is a lamp to my feet,
\q And light to my path.
\q
\v 106 I have sworn, and have confirmed it,
\q That I will observe your righteous ordinances.
\q
\v 107 I am afflicted very much:
\q Quicken me, O Jehovah, according to your word.
\q
\v 108 Accept, I beseech thee, the free will offerings of my mouth, O Jehovah,
\q And teach me your ordinances.
\q
\v 109 My soul is continually in my hand;
\q Yet do I not forget your law.
\q
\v 110 The wicked have laid a snare for me;
\q Yet have I not gone astray from your precepts.
\q
\v 111 Your testimonies have I taken as a heritage for ever;
\q For they are the rejoicing of my heart.
\q
\v 112 I have inclined my heart to perform your statutes
\q For ever, even to the end.
\b
\d SAMEKH.
\q
\v 113 I hate them that are of a double mind;
\q But your law do I love.
\q
\v 114 You are my hiding-place and my shield:
\q I hope in your word.
\q
\v 115 Depart from me, you evil-doers,
\q That I may keep the commandments of my God.
\q
\v 116 Uphold me according to your word, that I may live;
\q And let me not be ashamed of my hope.
\q
\v 117 Hold you me up, and I shall be safe,
\q And shall have respect to your statutes continually.
\q
\v 118 You have set at nothing all them that err from your statutes;
\q For their deceit is falsehood.
\q
\v 119 You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
\q Therefore I love your testimonies.
\q
\v 120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee;
\q And I am afraid of your judgments.
\b
\d AYIN.
\q
\v 121 I have done justice and righteousness:
\q Leave me not to mine oppressors.
\q
\v 122 Be surety for your servant for good:
\q Let not the proud oppress me.
\q
\v 123 Mine eyes fail for your salvation,
\q And for your righteous word.
\q
\v 124 Deal with your servant according to your lovingkindness,
\q And teach me your statutes.
\q
\v 125 I am your servant; give me understanding,
\q That I may know your testimonies.
\q
\v 126 It is time for Jehovah to work;
\q For they have made void your law.
\q
\v 127 Therefore I love your commandments
\q Above gold, yea, above fine gold.
\q
\v 128 Therefore I esteem all your precepts concerning all
things to be right;
\q And I hate every false way.
\b
\d PE.
\q
\v 129 Your testimonies are wonderful;
\q Therefore does my soul keep them.
\q
\v 130 The opening of your words gives light;
\q It gives understanding to the simple.
\q
\v 131 I opened wide my mouth, and panted;
\q For I longed for your commandments.
\q
\v 132 Turn you to me, and have mercy upon me,
\q As you usest to do to those that love your name.
\q
\v 133 Establish my footsteps in your word;
\q And let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
\q
\v 134 Redeem me from the oppression of man:
\q So will I observe your precepts.
\q
\v 135 Make your face to shine upon your servant;
\q And teach me your statutes.
\q
\v 136 Streams of water run down mine eyes,
\q Because they observe not your law.
\b
\d TSADHE.
\q
\v 137 Righteous are thou, O Jehovah,
\q And upright are your judgments.
\q
\v 138 You have commanded your testimonies in righteousness
\q And very faithfulness.
\q
\v 139 My zeal has consumed me,
\q Because mine adversaries have forgotten your words.
\q
\v 140 Your word is very pure;
\q Therefore your servant loves it.
\q
\v 141 I am small and despised;
\q Yet do I not forget your precepts.
\q
\v 142 Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,
\q And your law is truth.
\q
\v 143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me;
\q Yet your commandments are my delight.
\q
\v 144 Your testimonies are righteous for ever:
\q Give me understanding, and I shall live.
\b
\d QOPH.
\q
\v 145 I have called with my whole heart; answer me, O Jehovah:
\q I will keep your statutes.
\q
\v 146 I have called to thee; save me,
\q And I shall observe your testimonies.

\v 147 I anticipated the dawning of the morning, and cried:
\q I hoped in your words.
\q
\v 148 Mine eyes anticipated the night-watches,
\q That I might meditate on your word.
\q
\v 149 Hear my voice according to your lovingkindness:
\q Quicken me, O Jehovah, according to your ordinances.
\q
\v 150 They draw near that follow after wickedness;
\q They are far from your law.
\q
\v 151 You are nigh, O Jehovah;
\q And all your commandments are truth.
\q
\v 152 Of old have I known from your testimonies,
\q That you have founded them for ever.
\b

\q
\v 153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me;
\q For I do not forget your law.
\q
\v 154 Plead you my cause, and redeem me:
\q Quicken me according to your word.
\q
\v 155 Salvation is far from the wicked;
\q For they seek not your statutes.
\q
\v 156 Great are your tender mercies, O Jehovah:
\q Quicken me according to your ordinances.
\q
\v 157 Many are my persecutors and mine adversaries;
\q Yet have I not swerved from your testimonies.
\q
\v 158 I [*]saw the treacherous, and was grieved,
\q Because they observe not your word.
\q
\v 159 Consider how I love your precepts:
\q Quicken me, O Jehovah, according to your lovingkindness.
\q
\v 160 The sum of your word is truth;
\q And every one of your righteous ordinances endures for ever.
\b
\d SHIN.
\q
\v 161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause;
\q But my heart stands in awe of your words.
\q
\v 162 I rejoice at your word,
\q As one that finds great spoil.
\q
\v 163 I hate and abhor falsehood;
\q But your law do I love.
\q
\v 164 Seven times a day do I praise thee,
\q Because of your righteous ordinances.
\q
\v 165 Great peace have they that love your law;
\q And they have no occasion of stumbling.
\q
\v 166 I have hoped for your salvation, O Jehovah,
\q And have done your commandments.
\q
\v 167 My soul has observed your testimonies;
\q And I love them exceedingly.
\q
\v 168 I have observed your precepts and your testimonies;
\q For all my ways are before thee.
\b

\v 169 Let my cry come near before thee, O Jehovah:
\q Give me understanding according to your word.
\q
\v 170 Let my supplication come before thee:
\q Deliver me according to your word.

\q
\v 175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee;
\q And let your ordinances help me.
\q
\v 176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep;
\q Seek your servant;
\q For I do not forget your commandments.
