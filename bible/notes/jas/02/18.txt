\v 18 But someone may say \add to me\add*, "\add God saves\add* some people only \add because\add* they trust \add in him\add*, and \add he saves\add* others \add because\add* they do good deeds \add to people\add*." \add I would answer that person\add*, "\add You\f + \ft singular \f* cannot\add* prove to me that people truly trust \add in God if\add* they do not do good deeds \add to others\add*! But by doing good deeds \add to others\add* I will prove to you that I truly trust \add in God\add*!
\v 19 \add Think about it\add*! You believe that there is only one God, and you are right \add to believe that\add*. But the demons also believe that, but they tremble \add because they know that God is going to punish them\add*.
\v 20 Also, you foolish person, I will \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* prove to you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* that \add if someone says\add*, 'I trust \add in God\add*,' but he does not do good deeds, \add what that person says\add* will not benefit him.

\v 18 But someone may say to me, "God saves some people only because they trust in him, and he saves others because they do good deeds for people." I would answer that person, "You cannot prove to me that people truly trust in God if they do not do good deeds for others! But by doing good deeds for others I will prove to you that I truly trust in God!
\v 19 Think about it! You believe that there is only one real God who truly lives, and you are right to believe that. But the demons also believe that, and they tremble because they also know that God truly lives, and that He will punish them.
\v 20 Also, you foolish person, I will give you proof that if someone says, "I trust in God," but does not do good deeds, what that person says does not help him in any way.

\v 18 Yet someone may say, "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
\v 19 You believe that there is one God; you do well. But even the demons believe that, and they tremble.
\v 20 Do you want to know, foolish man, that faith without works is useless?
\f + \ft Some older versions read, \fqa Do you want to know, foolish man, how it is that faith without works is dead? \fqa* \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yet someone may say** - James describes a hypothetical situation where someone objects to his teaching. James seeks to correct his audience's understanding of faith and works. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **"You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works** - James is describing how someone may argue against his teaching and how he would respond. This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "faith" and "works." AT: "'It is acceptable that you believe God and that I do what God commands.' Prove to me that you can believe God and not do what he commands, and I will prove to you that I believe God by doing what he commands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **the demons believe that, and they tremble** - "the demons also believe, but they shake with fear." James contrasts the demons with those who claim to believe and not do good deeds. James states that the demons are wiser because they fear God while the others do not. 
  * **Do you want to know, foolish man, that faith without works is useless?** - James uses this question to introduce the next part of his teaching. AT: "Listen to me, foolish man, and will show that faith without works is useless." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **that faith without works is useless** - This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "faith" and "works." AT: "that if you do not do what God commands, then it is useless for you to say that you believe in God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
