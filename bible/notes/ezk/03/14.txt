===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **with bitterness in my spirit's rage**  - The word "bitterness" means a taste that is strong and bad.  Many fruits have a thick outer skin that is bitter so animals won't want to eat it.  Here it is used to refer to his emotions as strong and negative.  (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metaphor]])
  * **for the hand of Yahweh was deeply impressed upon me**  - The "impressed" means to press or push in and create the form of what has been pressed.  It is like pressing or pushing a hand into mud and creating the form or impression of a hand.  God impressed his ideas on to Ezekiel and they became a part of him.  "because the desire of Yahweh had become a part of me"
  * **captives at Tel-abib who dwelt along the river Chebar **- "exiles who lived at Tel Aviv near the Chebar Canal"
  * **awestruck**  - "astonished" or "overwhelmed"
