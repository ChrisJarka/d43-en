===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **You must go everywhere**  - "you must go to everyone." (UDB)  The writer here wants to show that Yahweh's word to Jeremiah includes complete provision for all ministry that God requires him to perform, in every place God asks him to go. 
    * **Yahweh's declaration** - "what Yahweh has declared" or "what Yahweh has said"
