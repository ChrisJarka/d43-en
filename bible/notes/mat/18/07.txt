\v 7 It will be terrible for those \f + \ft metonymy \f* who cause others to stop believing in me. \add God will punish them eternally\add*. It is inevitable that there will be \add those who\add* cause others to stop believing in me. But it will be horrible for everyone who does that.
\v 8 So, if you \add are wanting to use\add* one of your hands or feet to sin, \add stop using that hand or foot! Even if you have to\add* cut it off \add to avoid sinning, do it\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! It is good\add that you not sin and\add* go where you will live \add with God eternally, even though while you are still here on earth\add* you are maimed or lame and do not have a hand or a foot. But it is not good that you continue to have your two hands and two feet \add and do\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add the sinful things you want to, and as a result\add*, you are thrown into \add hell\add*, where there is eternal fire burning.

\v 7 Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! for it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe to that man
through whom the occasion cometh!
\v 8 And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you: it is good for you to enter into
life maimed or halt, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.
