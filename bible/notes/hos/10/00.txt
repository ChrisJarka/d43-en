== Jacob ==
Again the usse of various names for the peoples of the two kingdoms can be confusing. In verse 11, Ephraim is mentioned and means the Northern Kingdom of Israel, and Judah is mentioned as the Southern Kingdom of Judah. However, Jacob is also mentioned. This use of Jacob conjures up the earlier unified nation and so points to a future reunification too.
