\v 3 And why behold you the mote that is in your brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in your own eye?
\v 4 Or how will you say to your brother, Let me cast out the mote out of your eye; and lo, the beam is in your own eye?
\v 5 You hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of your own eye; and then shall you see clearly to cast out the mote out of
your brother’s eye.
