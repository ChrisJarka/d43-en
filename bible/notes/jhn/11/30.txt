\v 30 (Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)
\v 31 The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and
went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
\v 32 Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had
been here, my brother had not died.
