\v 10 And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward
Jerusalem) and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
\v 11 Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.
