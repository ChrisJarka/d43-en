\v 17 And one of the multitude answered him, Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a dumb spirit;
\v 18 and wherever it takes him, it dasheth him down: and he foameth, and grindeth his teeth, and pineth away: and I spoke
to your disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able.
\v 19 And he answereth them and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you?
bring him to me.
