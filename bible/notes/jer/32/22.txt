\v 22 and gave them this land, which you did swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
\v 23 and they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of
all that you commanded them to do: therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them.
