====== Daniel ======

===== Facts: =====

Daniel was an Israelite prophet who as a young man was taken captive from Judah by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar around 600 BC. This was during the time that many other Israelites from Judah were held captive in Babylon for 70 years.

  * While in captivity, Daniel was given the Babylonian name Belteshazzar; he was an honorable and righteous young man who obeyed God.
  * Daniel was given a high leadership position within Babylon when he correctly interpreted King Nebuchadnezzar's first dream as a revelation from God about the fate of the Babylonian empire and other kingdoms.
  * Many years later, Daniel enemies tricked the new Babylonian king Darius into making a law forbidding the worship of anyone except the king. But Daniel continued to bow down and pray to God, so he was arrested and thrown into a den of lions. But God rescued him and he was not harmed at all.
