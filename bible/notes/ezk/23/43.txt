\v 43 Then I said about the woman who had become exhausted by her having sex with many men, 'Now allow those men to act toward her as though she is a prostitute, because that is all that she is.'
\v 44 So they had sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with those two women, Oholah and Oholibah, like men have sex with prostitutes.
\v 45 But righteous men will condemn them to be punished, like women who commit adultery and who murder others are punished, because those women commit adultery and they murder \f + \ft metonymy \f* others.

\v 43 I said to the one worn out by adulteries, ‘Now they will whore about with her and she will whore about with them.’
\v 44 Then they went in to her as they go in to a prostitute, so they went to Oholah and Oholibah – women of prostitution!
\v 45 But righteous men will judge them with the judgment for adultery and the judgment of one who pours out blood, since they have committed adultery 
and have blood on their hands.
