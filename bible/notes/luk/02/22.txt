\v 22-23 It had been written by Moses \f + \ft Or:Moses had written \f* \add long ago\add* in a law that God gave him, that when a woman gave birth to her first son, the parents had to take him \add to the Temple\add* in Jerusalem in order that they might dedicate him to the Lord\f + \ft Or: to God \f*. So when the time came for them to do those rituals so that \add God would consider\add* them pure again, Mary and Joseph took Jesus there.
\v 24 God had commanded in his laws that if the first child \add of a couple\add* was a boy, his parents should offer as a sacrifice to God two turtledoves or two young pigeons. \add So Joseph and Mary gave the priest two birds so he could offer them\add*.

    * **male that opens the womb**  - This is an idiom for "firstborn offspring that is a male." The law was about the firstborn offspring of both people and domestic animals, but in this context it could also be translated as "firstborn son." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:idiom|Idiom]])
