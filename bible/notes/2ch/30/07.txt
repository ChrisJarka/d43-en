\v 7 And be not you like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that
he gave them up to desolation, as you see.
\v 8 Now be you not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves to Jehovah, and enter into his sanctuary, which he
has sanctified for ever, and serve Jehovah your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
\v 9 For if you turn again to Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them
captive, and shall come again into this land: for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face
from you, if you return to him.
