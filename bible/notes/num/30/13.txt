\v 13 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
\v 14 But if her husband altogether holds his peace at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her. He has established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
