\v 16 The people in this land have had many troubles,

\v 15 And you shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen; and the Lord Jehovah will kill thee; and he will call his
servants by another name:
\v 16 so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth
shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
