====== hope ======

===== Definition: =====

Text

  * In the Bible, the word hope includes the idea of wishing that something will happen but we are not sure it will happen, giving it the same meaning as the secular use of the word.  However, Christian hope also refers to trusting in God's character and provision for us in times of trouble.  It refers to an assurance of our salvation.  It is a living hope that is an anchor for our souls, a salvation we know we have through Christ although we have not yet entered into heaven.
