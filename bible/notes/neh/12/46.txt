\v 46 For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to
God.
\v 47 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters,
as every day required: and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart
that which was for the sons of Aaron.
