\v 11 And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim;
\v 12 and they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods,
of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down to them: and they provoked Jehovah to anger.
\v 13 And they forsook Jehovah, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
