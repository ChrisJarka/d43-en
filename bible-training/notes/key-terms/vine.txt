====== vine ======


===== Definition: =====


A vine is a plant that grows either by creeping along the ground or by climbing other plants or structures. The word "vine" in the Bible is used exclusively of fruit bearing vines and usually refers to grape vines specifically.


    * Branches grow along the stems of the vines and get their strength from the nutrients flowing from the stem.
    * Jesus called himself the vine and his people the branches. In this case, the word "vine" could also be translated as "vine stem" or, "stem."
