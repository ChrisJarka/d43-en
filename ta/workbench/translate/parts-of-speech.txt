====== Parts of Speech ======

**(This is not an exhaustive list but it covers the basics)**

The **VERB** is either an action or a state-of-being word such as is, are, was. The portion of the sentence which contains the verb is called the predicate. More detailed information can be found on [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_verbs]].

**NOUNS** are words that represent a person, place, thing or idea. Proper Nouns are capitalized and refer to a specific entity (e.g. Peter, Calvary Baptist); common nouns are generic (e.g. disciples, church). Nouns have various roles in a sentence, including: subject, appositive (which renames a subject), nominatives, and objects. Also see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnoun]] 

**PRONOUNS** take the place of nouns and include such words as he, she, it, they and we. More detailed pages on pronouns can be found on [[Pronouns]].

**CONJUNCTIONS** are word that join phrases or sentences. Examples include: and, or, but, for, yet and nor. Some  conjunctions are used in pairs: both/and; either/or; neither/nor; not only/but also. (More information about these can be found on [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_connectingwords]])

**PREPOSITIONS** are words that begin phrases which connect a noun or verb with more detail. For example, "The boat was //off the shore//." Here the phrase with "off" tells the location of the boat in relations to the shore. Another example would be "The crowd //around Jesus// grew in numbers." The phrase with "around" tells the location of the people in relation to Jesus. Some examples of prepositions are: to, from, in, out, on, off, with, without, above, below, before, after, behind, in front of, among, through, beyond, among.

**ARTICLES** are the term used to describe the words: a, an, the. "The" is a definite article which means a specific one (e.g. the dog) instead of a generic description such as "a dog." 'A' is used preceding words that start with a consonant letter (e.g. a book); 'An' is used preceding words beginning with a vowel (e.g. an egg). Articles are actually part of a larger group of words called adjectives.

**ADJECTIVES** are words that describe nouns and convey such things as quantity, size and color; they help us identity 'which one' or 'what kind.' Sometimes people use adjectives to tell which one, and sometimes people use them to tell something about them. For example - My eldest sister (“Eldest” tells which one.) My elderly father (“Elderly” tells something about my father). (More information about this can be found on [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])

**ADVERBS** are words that describe verbs or adjectives and tell such things as how, when, why, to what extent or where. Many English adverbs end in 'ly.',

**GERUNDS** are verbs changed into nouns by adding 'ing' to the end of the verb. For example: Reading delivers treasures.

**INFINITIVES** are words with 'to' placed in front of a verb. For example, 'To learn the details of English is challenging.'
