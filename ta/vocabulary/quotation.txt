In English there are direct or non-direct, or indirect, quotations.


    * **DIRECT**  quotations are when someone reports someone else’s speech the way the other person would have said it.  (She said, “Come.” and then he said, “I will come.”) Direct quotations are written between quote marks “ ”.
    * **INDIRECT**  or **NON-DIRECT**  quotations are when someone reports basically what another person said, but from his own perspective. (She told him to come. He said he would come.) The pronouns change, and often there is a change in the verb tense.  Indirect quotations are written without quote marks “ ”.

===== How to Translate =====


Some languages have more than one kind of **NON-DIRECT ** quotations. If that is true of your language, consider the best non-direct quotation you should use.


Remember that **DIRECT**  quotes in the source text should be direct quotes in the translated text. Perhaps your language organizes the sentence differently, you should then organize the sentence to keep the direct quote.
