\v 20 He said to me, "This is the place where the priests will cook the meat of the offerings that people make because they failed to do what they promised Yahweh that they would do, and offerings to cause people to become acceptable to God, and where they will bake bread made with the flour brought as offerings. They will cook those things in their rooms in order to avoid bringing them into the outer courtyard \add to cook them there\add*, lest someone \add might be harmed by\add* touching them."

\v 19 Next he brought me through the entrance that was opposite the gate to the holy halls to the priests, that faced north and behold! There was a place in the back towards the west.
