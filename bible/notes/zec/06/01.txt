\v 1 Then I turned and lifted my eyes and I saw four chariots coming out from between two mountains; and the two mountains were made of bronze.
\v 2 The first chariot had red horses, the second chariot had black horses,
\v 3 the third chariot had white horses, and the fourth chariot had spotted gray horses.
\v 4 So I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my master?"
