====== Translation and Checking Roadmap ======

===== Before You Start =====

Before you start translating, be sure you agree with the [[en:ta:intro:statement-of-faith|Statement of Faith]], [[en:ta:intro:translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines]], and the terms of the [[en:ta:intro:license|Open License]]. 

Next you need to decide what [[en:ta:intro:projects|Project]] you want to translate. We strongly recommend that you start translating [[en:ta:intro:obs-project|Open Bible Stories]]. It has been designed for simple translation and will give great experience in translating before attempting a larger, more difficult project like [[en:ta:intro:bible-project|the Bible]].

You will also need to decide where you will do the translation. It is recommended that translation and checking be done [[en:ta:tech:door43|online at Door43]] or [[en:ta:tech:ts|offline on translationStudio]]. If neither of these options is possible, using a word processor may work though not recommended - please contact an unfoldingWord representative before you attempt this method.

If you get stuck along the way or would like some encouragement, feel free to [[https://hall.com/invites/4-0kfZ-9_0pi3FtB-dt7jA|join the team on Hall]] - a chat room for translators. 

===== Translating =====

Be sure you consult the [[en:ta:translate|Translation Manual]] as you do your translation. Pray that God would help you to make an easily-understandable, Scripturally accurate translation. Translate everything in the source language and don't add anything that isn't necessary for comprehension. Remember, all translations must be done in accordance with the [[en:ta:intro:statement-of-faith|Statement of Faith]] and [[en:ta:intro:translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines]].

===== Checking =====

After you finish translating, you will want to check your work. We recommend using the [[en:ta:check|Checking Manual]]. Before we publish anything to the unfoldingWord website or mobile app it must be checked to [[en:ta:check:level1|Level 1]] and for Bible passages it must be checked to [[en:ta:check:level2|Level 2]]. To serve as a source text for another language, a resource has to be checked to [[en:ta:check:level3|Level 3]].

===== After Completing =====

After you have completed any step in the process you are encouraged to put your work online so that others can benefit from your work and help in the checking process. 

We also encourage resources to be recorded as [[en:ta:tech:audio|audio]] files and some resources can even be converted into [[en:ta:tech:video|video]]. 

If you have completed one project, you may want to start translating another [[en:ta:intro:projects|project]]. 

Our ultimate goal is that the global church receive the spiritual food that they need, so we encourage these resources to be distributed. To that end we have created the unfoldingWord website and mobile app that makes sharing easy. Completed and checked works are also formatted for printing so that hard copies may be printed and distributed.
