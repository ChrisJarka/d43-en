\v 10 Many people consider us to be \f + \ft irony \f* fools because \add we preach about\add* Christ, but you proudly \add think \f + \ft irony \f* that\add* you are wise because of your close relationship with\f + \ft Or: you belong to \f* Christ. Many people \add consider us\add* \f + \ft irony \f* to be unimpressive, but you \add proudly think that you\add* impress others. People respect you, but they do not respect us.
\v 11 Up to this present time we have often been hungry. We have often been thirsty. We have ragged clothes. Often we have been beaten \f + \ft Or:others have beaten us \f*. We \add have traveled so much that we\add* have no regular homes to live in.

<usfm>
\v 10 We are fools for Christ, and you see yourselves as wise ones. You see us as weak, but you are the strong ones! You are honored with praise, but we are the despised ones!
\v 11 Up to this present time we have hungry and thirsty. We have been so poor we couldn't afford our own clothing. We have been brutally beaten again and again. We have no place to call our home.

\v 10 We are fools for Christâ€™s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we are held in dishonor.
