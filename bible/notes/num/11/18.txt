\v 18 And say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and you shall eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and you shall eat.
\v 19 You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,
