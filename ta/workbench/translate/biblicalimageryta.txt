==== Description ==== 

Imagery is figurative language in which an image is associated with another idea. This includes metaphors, similes, metonymies, and cultural models. Most metaphors, similes, and metonymies in a language or culture fall into patterns of associations between images and ideas, but some do not. These pages on Biblical Imagery tell about patterns of imagery in the Bible. To learn about associations that do not fall into patterns, see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]], and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]. 

==== Metaphors and Similes ====

Most **metaphors** and **similes** in the Bible fall into broad patterns of associations between ideas: an image and the thing it is associated with. These patterns are often unique to the Hebrew and Greek languages. It is useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems on how to translate them. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere they see the same patterns.

See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part1]] for links to pages showing common patterns of associations between ideas in metaphors and similes.

==== Common Metonymies ====

In metonymy, a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. \\ 

See [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part2]] for a list of some common metonymies in the Bible.


==== Cultural Models ====
Cultural models can be described as systems of thought about things or experiences. These systems of thought are more elaborate and more developed than metaphorical patterns and metonymies. Some of these cultural models were used extensively by the cultures in the Ancient Near East, and not only by the Israelites. 

See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part3]] for a list of cultural models in the Bible.
