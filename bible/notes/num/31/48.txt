===== translationNotes: =====


  * **the commanders over thousands and the captains over hundreds** - Possible meanings are 1) these numbers represent the exact amount of soldiers that these commanders and captains led. AT: "the commanders over 1,000 soldiers and the captains over 100 soldiers" or 2) the words translated as "thousands" and "hundreds" do not represent exact numbers, but are the names of larger and smaller military divisions. AT: "the commanders over large military divisions and the captains over smaller military divisions" See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:num:31:13|31:14]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Your servants have counted** - The commanders refer to themselves as "your servants." This is a polite way to speak to someone with greater authority.
  * **not one man is missing** - This can be stated in a positive statement. "we know for certain that every man is here" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
