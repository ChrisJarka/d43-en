\v 14 \add I know that you will be able to do that\add*, because Yahweh, the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says this: 'There will always be plenty of flour and \add olive\add* oil left in your containers, until the time when I send rain again \add and the crops grow again\add*!'~"
\p
\v 15 So the woman did exactly what Elijah told her to do. And she and her son and Elijah had enough food every day,
\v 16 because the flour in the jar was never finished, and the jug of oil was never empty. That happened just like Yahweh had told Elijah that it would happen.

\v 14 For thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that Jehovah sends rain upon the earth.
\v 15 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.
\v 16 The jar of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spoke by Elijah.
