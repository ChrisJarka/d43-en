====== Sentences ======

===== Sentence Types =====

A **//sentence//** is a group of words that express a complete thought. The basic types of sentences are:

   * **Declarative **- These are usually used to give information. '//This is a fact.//'
  * **Interrogative **- These are usually used to ask for information. '//Do you know him?//'
  * **Exclamation **- These are usually used to express a feeling. '//Ouch, that hurt!//'
  * **Imperative **  or **Command **- These are usually used to make something happen. '//Pick that up.//'
Sentences can be used for other purposes as well.

===== Sentence Structure =====

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>The simplest sentence structure in English includes a  //  ** subject  **  // and an  //  ** action  **  // word. '  // The boy ran.'  //</font>

==== Roles ====

The following terms are used in the explanations below:

**Actor**  - The one who does something.

**Patient**  - The one something is done to.

**Recipient**  - The one who receives something.

**Addressee**  - The one who is spoken to.

==== Subject ====

The //**subject**// is who or what the sentence is about.

Subjects are typically nouns or pronouns. (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:parts-of-speech|English Parts of Speech]] for more information.)

Sometimes a subject is not stated but is implied. For example, //'Close the door//.' The verb is 'close'; the subject is implied to be 'you.' See [[:en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]] for more information.

Usually the subject is a **noun phrase**  - //'the boy'//  It can also be a clause: //'that young boy'//; or verb phrase: //'the hard running boy'//.
==== Predicate ====

The predicate is the part of a sentence which tells something about the subject. It usually has a [[:en:ta:vocabulary:verbs|verb]]. The verb may have an object or a complement.

Here are some examples: \\ '//The man is strong//.' - the subject is '//the man//' and the predicate is '//is strong//' (that describes the man.) \\ '//He worked hard//.' - the subject is '//he//' and the predicate is '//worked hard//' (something the man did.)

==== Clause ====

A sentence can have more than one set of subjects and predicates. Each set is called a clause.

This is an example of a sentence that has two clauses:\\
'//He planted the yams and his wife planted the corn//.'\\
'//He planted the yams//' is one clause. '//His wife planted the corn//' is another clause.\\
We can use underlining to help us see the clauses. //__He planted the yams__ and __his wife planted the corn__.//

In the above example, each of the clauses can be a complete sentence. '//He planted the yams//.' and '//His wife planted the corn//.' Compound sentences are two complete sentences joined together with a comma and a **conjunction** (i.e. and, or, but).\\
For example: //He planted the yams __and__ his wife planted the corn.//

Here is a sentence that have two clauses. The underlined clause cannot be a sentence by itself.

'//__When the corn was ready__, his wife picked it//.'\\
The clause “when the corn was ready” is a clause, but it is not a full sentence. The clause “his wife picked it up” is a complete sentence.

In some languages, clauses can tell about something in the sentence. These are called **relative** clauses.

   * Relative clauses can **define **  which thing is being talked about. For example: '//She put a little food in her own bag and a lot of food in the **bag **__that belonged to her only sister__//.' This relative clause '//that belonged to her only sister//' defines which bag.
  * Relative clauses can **describe **  or tell some more information.
  * Some languages can use relative clauses both for defining and describing.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Many Bible verses contain various components such as phrases, clauses and/or participles. Example: //Although the boy ran very hard, he couldn't catch the fox, which disappeared into the woods.//

Translators should use the sentence structure of the target language so that the final translation is natural. Some aspects of this include **[[:en:ta:vocabulary:wordorder|Word Order]])** and **clause order**. (See:

For example, in English, adjectives almost always come before the noun they describe, but in French, adjectives can occur before or after the noun, depending on their type.

  * English: t//he pretty flower//
  * French: //la jolie fleur//
  * English:// the purple flower//
  * French:// la fleur violette//

Sometimes languages put an object pronoun before the verb, whereas English puts it after the verb.

  * English: //The man sees the house.//
  * French: //L'homme voit la maison. //
  * English: //The man sees it. //
  * French: //L'homme la voit. //

Languages will also differ as to how they order their clauses. Some languages can use relative clauses both for defining and describing. Other languages only use relative clauses for defining. If your language is one of these, and you find a relative clause that simply describes, you may need to express it in a different way. For example:

After putting the food in the bags, she brought them to their **house**, __which was in the village.__

After putting the food in the bags, she brought them to their house. Her house was in the village.
