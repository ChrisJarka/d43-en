<usfm>
\v 7 Jehovah did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples:
\v 8 but because Jehovah loves you, and because he would keep the oath which he sware to your fathers, has Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
