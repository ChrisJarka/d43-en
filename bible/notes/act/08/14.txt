===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Samaria **- Again, This may be the city or the province. See note on v.5. Not everyone in Samaria received the Word. Samaria is a reference to a place where some had come to the Lord.
  * **they had only been baptized**  - Philip had only baptized them. (See Active or Passive.) Usually receiving the Holy Spirit and being baptized happened right away. This time they had only been baptized; they had to wait for the Holy Spirit till Peter and John arrived.
  * **placed their hands on them**  - as a symbol of God giving the people the Holy Spirit through Peter and John.
  * **Samaria had received the word of God**  - The people of Samaria had received the word of God. <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>(See metonymy.)</font>
