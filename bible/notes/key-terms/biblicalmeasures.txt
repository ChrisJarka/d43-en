^ Type    ^ Measurement  ^    Value ^ Units   ^
| Dry/Liq |              |          |         |
| Dry     | homer        |   220.00 | liters  |
| Dry     | kor          |   220.00 | liters  |
| Dry     | seah         |     7.70 | liters  |
| Liquid  | bath         |    22.00 | liters  |
| Liquid  | hin          |     3.70 | liters  |
| Liquid  | kab          |     1.23 | liters  |
| Liquid  | log          |     0.31 | liters  |

How to translate units of measure in the Bible:

  - Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. [See Transliterate]
  - An important reason for keeping the Bible terms is to show that the Bible is true and that people actually used these units of measure during that time period.
  - If it doesn't work to use the Bible term, then instead, state the equivalent amount using a unit of measure that is known.
  - These methods could be combined, using the Bible term but then also giving the equivalent amount in the text or a note.
