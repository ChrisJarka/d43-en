====== Ezra 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The completion of story of the building of the temple and re-establishment of the temple worship (Ezra 3-6) 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

The king wrote back saying the Jews were right and ordering money from his taxes be used to help them with the sacrifices. 


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

"Assyria's king" Darius was king of Persia but since Persia had conquered Babylon, which had conquered Assyria he was also, in one sense, the king of Assyria. Here it is probably used in contrast to the former times when Assyria was cruel of the Jews. In many languages it may be clearer just to call him the king of Persia.
