<usfm>
\c 9
\q
\v 1 Oh, my head produces water; my eyes are a fountain of tears!
\q For I weep by day and night for the pierced ones of the daughter of my people!
\q
\v 2 Oh, may he give me a lodging for wanderers in the desert, so I might abandon my people;
\q So I could go from them since all of them are adulterers, a band of traitors!
\q
\v 3 For they declare with their tongues, their bows of deceit, but they are not greater in faithfulness on the earth,
\q For they go out from wickedness to wickedness and do not know me!—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
</usfm>
