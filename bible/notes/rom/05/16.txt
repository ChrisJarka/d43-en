\v 16 And \add there is another way in which God's\add* freely \add erasing the record of our sins\add* is not like \add the results of Adam's\add* sinning. One person, \add Adam, sinned\add*. As a result, God declared that all people deserve to be punished. Many people sinned. But what God did was that he erased the record of their sins without their earning it.
\v 17 All people die \f + \ft metaphor, personification \f* because of what one man, \add Adam\add*, did. But now many of us experience that God has abundantly acted towards us in ways we did not deserve, and we experience that he has erased the record of our sins without our earning it. It is also very certain that we will rule \add with Christ\add* \f + \ft Or: share \add the glory\add* of Christ's being king \f*, \add in heaven. This will happen\add* because of \add what\add* one man, Jesus Christ, \add did for us\add*.

\v 16 And there is another way in which God's gift is different from Adam's sin. Because Adam sinned, all people sin since him, and God declared that all people deserve to be punished. But as a kind gift, God offers to put us right with himself, even after we have sinned so greatly against him.
\v 17 All people die because of what one man, Adam, did. But now many of us experience that God has kindly given us a very great giftâ€”which we do not deserve: he has put us right with himself. It is also very certain that we will rule with Christ in heaven. This will happen because of what one man, Jesus Christ, did for us.

\v 16 For the gift is not like the outcome of the one who sinned. For on one hand, the judgment of condemnation came because of the trespass of one man; but on the other hand, the free gift resulting in justification came after many trespasses. 

\v 17 For if, by the trespass of one, death ruled through the one, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness rule through the life of the one, Jesus Christ.
