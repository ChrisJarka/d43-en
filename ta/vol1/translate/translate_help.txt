===== Help with Translating =====

This module answers the question: Where do I find help for translating?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: ['translate_what']

To help translators make the best translation possible, [[:en:obs:notes|Translation Notes]] and [[:en:obe:kt:home|Open Bible Encyclopedia]] have been created.
Translation Notes are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain the context in which the stories from Open Bible Stories was written as well as inform the translator of translation options available to them.
The Important Terms are key terms found in Open Bible Stories that are very crucial that they be translated correctly. Each Important Term has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places that term is used in Open Bible Stories to ensure that it has been translated correctly there, too.
Once you have consulted the Translation Notes and Important Terms, then you are ready to make the best translation.
**Please use the Translation Notes & Important Terms when doing your translation!**
