===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins an account of Jesus sending out his twelve apostles to do his work.

  * **called his twelve disciples together **- This has the meaning of calling these particular disciples to do the tasks that are described here. It can be translated "summoned his twelve disciples."
  * **unclean spirits**  - According to Jewish laws about ritual purity, people controlled by evil spirits were considered ceremonially unclean and were excluded from the social and religious life of the community. If your language has a way to convey this idea, it should be used. If not, "unclean spirits" can be translated "evil spirits" or "demons" or "evil spirits that controlled people." (UDB)
  * **drive them out **- This can be translated "make them leave." The pronoun "them" refers to the unclean spirits.
  * **all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness **- This can also be translated "every disease and every sickness." The words "disease" and "sickness" are closely related but should be translated as two different words if possible. "Disease" is what causes a person to be sick. "Sickness" is the physical weakness or affliction that results from having a disease.
