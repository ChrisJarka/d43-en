\c 41
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Blessed is he that considers the poor:
\q Jehovah will deliver him in the day of evil.
\q
\v 2 Jehovah will preserve him, and keep him alive,
\q And he shall be blessed upon the earth;
\q And deliver not you him to the will of his enemies.
\q
\v 3 Jehovah will support him upon the couch of languishing:
\q You make all his bed in his sickness.
\q
\v 4 I said, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me:
\q Heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
\q
\v 5 Mine enemies speak evil against me, saying,
\q When will he die, and his name perish?
\q
\v 6 And if he come to see me, he speaks falsehood;
\q His heart gathers iniquity to itself:
\q When he goes abroad, he tells it.
\q
\v 7 All that hate me whisper together against me;
\q Against me do they devise my hurt.
\q
\v 8 An evil disease, say they, clings fast to him;
\q And now that he lies he shall rise up no more.
\q
\v 9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,
\q Who did eat of my bread,
\q Hath lifted up his heel against me.
\q
\v 10 But thou, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me, and raise me up,
\q That I may requite them.
\q
\v 11 By this I know that you delightest in me,
\q Because mine enemy does not triumph over me.
\q
\v 12 And as for me, you upholdest me in mine integrity,
\q And set me before your face for ever.
\b
\q
\v 13 Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,
\q From everlasting and to everlasting.
\q Amen, and Amen.
