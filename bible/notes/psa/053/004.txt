<usfm>
\v 4 Will all these evil people never learn \add what God will do to them\add*?
\q1 They act violently toward Yahweh's people while eating the food that he provides),
\q2 and they never pray to Yahweh.
\q1
\v 5 But \add some day\add* those people will become very terrified,
\q2 like they have never been terrified before,
\q1 because God will cause those who are separated from God to die,
\q2 and he will scatter their bones.
\q1 They have rejected God,
\q2 so he will cause them to be \add defeated and\add* completely disgraced.

<usfm>
\v 4 Will all these evil people never learn what God will do to them?
\q1 They hurt Yahweh's people with terrible violence, while they are enjoying the very food that God  provided for them.
\q2 Still, they never pray to Yahweh.
\q1
\v 5 But someday those people will become very terrified,
\q2 although they have nothing to fear.
\q1 For God will cause those who attack you to die,
\q2 and he will scatter their bones.
\q1 They have rejected God,
\q2 so he will cause them to be defeated and completely disgraced.
\b


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 Do those who commit iniquity, not know anythingâ€”
\q those who devour my people as if they were eating bread
\q and who do not call on God?
\q
\v 5 They were in great fear, although no reason to fear was there;
\q for God will scatter the bones of whoever will camp against you;
\q such people will be put to shame because God has rejected them.
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do they not know anything, those who commit iniquity ... God?** - This question shows the shock that the writer feels because the people are so sinful. It can be written as a statement. "Those who commit iniquity act as though they do not know anything. They eat up my people as they eat bread and they do not call on God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **those who eat up my people as they eat bread** - Destroying people is spoken of as eating them. AT: "those who destroy my people as easily as they eat bread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **God will scatter the bones of whoever will camp against you** - The result of many people dying in battle is that there will be bones lying wherever each person's body lay. "God will completely destroy whoever will camp against you, and their bones will be scattered on the ground" (See: (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **whoever will camp against you** - Camping against people represents attacking them. Enemy armies would travel and set up camps to live in temporarily near the people they wanted to attack. AT: "whoever will attack you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
