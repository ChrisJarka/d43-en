\v 43 "You have heard that God said to our ancestors,  'Love your fellow Israelites and hate foreigners, for they are your enemies.'
\v 44 But now listen to what I say to you: love your enemies as well as your friends, and pray for those who cause you to suffer.
\v 45 Do this in order to be like God, your Father who is in heaven. He acts kindly to all people. For example, he causes the sun to shine equally on wicked people and on good people, and he sends rain both on people who obey his law and on people who do not.

\v 43 You have heard that it was said, 'You will love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
\v 44 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
\v 45 so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.
