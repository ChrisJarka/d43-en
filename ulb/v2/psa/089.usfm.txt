\q
\v 1 I will sing of the lovingkindness of Jehovah for ever:
\q With my mouth will I make known your faithfulness to all generations.
\q
\v 2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever;
\q Your faithfulness will you establish in the very heavens.
\b
\q
\v 3 I have made a covenant with my chosen,
\q I have sworn to David my servant:
\q
\v 4 Your seed will I establish for ever,
\q And build up your throne to all generations. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 And the heavens shall praise your wonders, O Jehovah;
\q Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
\q
\v 6 For who in the skies can be compared to Jehovah?
\q Who among the sons of the mighty is like to Jehovah,
\q
\v 7 A God very terrible in the council of the holy ones,
\q And to be feared above all them that are round about him?
\q
\v 8 O Jehovah God of hosts,
\q Who is a mighty one, like to thee, O Jehovah?
\q And your faithfulness is round about thee.
\q
\v 9 You rule the pride of the sea:
\q When the waves thereof arise, you stillest them.
\q
\v 10 You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain;
\q You have scattered your enemies with the arm of your strength.
\q
\v 11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine:
\q The world and the fulness thereof, you have founded them.
\q
\v 12 The north and the south, you have created them:
\q Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.
\q
\v 13 You have a mighty arm;
\q Strong is your hand, and high is your right hand.
\q
\v 14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne:
\q Lovingkindness and truth go before your face.
\q
\v 15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound:
\q They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of your countenance.
\q
\v 16 In your name do they rejoice all the day;
\q And in your righteousness are they exalted.
\q
\v 17 For you are the glory of their strength;
\q And in your favor our horn shall be exalted.
\q
\v 18 For our shield belongs to Jehovah;
\q And our king to the Holy One of Israel.
\b
\q
\v 19 Then you spoke in vision to your saints,
\q And saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty;
\q I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
\q
\v 20 I have found David my servant;
\q With my holy oil have I anointed him:
\q
\v 21 With whom my hand shall be established;
\q Mine arm also shall strengthen him.
\q
\v 22 The enemy shall not exact from him,
\q Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
\q
\v 23 And I will beat down his adversaries before him,
\q And strike them that hate him.
\q
\v 24 But my faithfulness and my lovingkindness shall be with him;
\q And in my name shall his horn be exalted.
\q
\v 25 I will set his hand also on the sea,
\q And his right hand on the rivers.
\q
\v 26 He shall cry to me, You are my Father,
\q My God, and the rock of my salvation.
\q
\v 27 I also will make him my first-born,
\q The highest of the kings of the earth.
\q
\v 28 My lovingkindness will I keep for him for evermore;
\q And my covenant shall stand fast with him.
\q
\v 29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever,
\q And his throne as the days of heaven.
\q
\v 30 If his children forsake my law,
\q And walk not in mine ordinances;
\q
\v 31 If they break my statutes,
\q And keep not my commandments;
\q
\v 32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod,
\q And their iniquity with stripes.
\q
\v 33 But my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,
\q Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
\q
\v 34 My covenant will I not break,
\q Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
\q
\v 35 Once have I sworn by my holiness:
\q I will not lie to David:
\q
\v 36 His seed shall endure for ever,
\q And his throne as the sun before me.
\q
\v 37 It shall be established for ever as the moon,
\q And as the faithful witness in the sky. \qs [Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 38 But you have cast off and rejected,
\q You have been angry with your anointed.
\q
\v 39 You have abhorred the covenant of your servant:
\q You have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
\q
\v 40 You have broken down all his hedges;
\q You have brought his strongholds to ruin.
\q
\v 41 All that pass by the way rob him:
\q He is become a reproach to his neighbors.
\q
\v 42 You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries;
\q You have made all his enemies to rejoice.
\q
\v 43 Yea, you turn back the edge of his sword,
\q And have not made him to stand in the battle.
\q
\v 44 You have made his brightness to cease,
\q And cast his throne down to the ground.
\q
\v 45 The days of his youth have you shortened:
\q You have covered him with shame. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 46 How long, O Jehovah? will you hide yourself for ever?
\q How long shall your wrath burn like fire?
\q
\v 47 Oh remember how short my time is:
\q For what vanity have you created all the children of men!
\q
\v 48 What man is he that shall live and not see death,
\q That shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 49 Lord, where are your former lovingkindnesses,
\q Which you swore to David in your faithfulness?
\q
\v 50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants;
\q How I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty peoples,
\q
\v 51 Wherewith your enemies have reproached, O Jehovah,
\q Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of your anointed.
\b
\q
\v 52 Blessed be Jehovah for evermore.
\q Amen, and Amen.
