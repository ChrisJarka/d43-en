===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **John answered and said**  - That is, "in answer, John said" or "as an answer, John said."
    * **Master**  - The Greek word that is translated here as “Master” is a not the normal word for “Master.” This one refers to someone who has authority, and not to  someone who owns someone else. You could also translate it as "Boss" or "Foreman" or with a word that is commonly used to address a person in authority, such as “Sir.”
    * **he that is not against you is for you** - That is, "he that doesn't hinder you, helps you" or "he that isn't working contrary to you is working in your favor."
