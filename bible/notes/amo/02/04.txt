\v 4 Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
they have rejected the law of Jehovah, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which
their fathers did walk.
\v 5 But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
