\v 25 For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. That is why I, your servant, have found courage to pray to you.
\v 26 Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have made this good promise to your servant:
\v 27 Now it has pleased you to bless your servant's house, that it may continue forever before you. You, Yahweh, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - David continues to speak to Yahweh.

  * **your servant** - David refers to himself as "your servant." This can be expressed in the first person. AT: "me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **that you will build him a house** - Here the metonym "house" refers to David's ancestors continuing on as the rulers of Israel. In [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:17:03|17:4]] Yahweh tells David he would not be the one to build a house for Yahweh. There "house" represented a temple. If your language has a word that can express both ideas, use it here and in 17:4. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I, your servant, have found courage** - The abstract noun "courage" can be expressed here as the verb "encouraged." AT: "I, your servant, am encouraged"
  * **Now** - This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.
  * **your servant's house** - David speaks of himself in the third person. This can be expressed in the first person. AT: "my house" or "my family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **You, Yahweh, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever** - These two phrases have about the same meaning and are repeated here for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **it will be blessed forever** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "you will continue to bless it forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
