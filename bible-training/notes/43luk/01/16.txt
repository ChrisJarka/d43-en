===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (The angel continues speaking to Zechariah.)
    *  **cause**  – Other ways to translate this are "influence" and "persuade."
    * **many of the sons of Israel**  - Another way to translate this is, "many of Israel's descendants." If it sounds like Zechariah is not included, this phrase could be translated as, "many of you (pl) descendants of Israel" or, "many of you (pl) who are God's people, Israel." If this change is made, make sure that "their God" is also changed to "your (pl) God."
    * **turn back to the Lord their God **  - That is, "(stop sinning and) start obeying the Lord their God again."
    * **in advance of him**  - That is, "in advance of the Lord." He would go as a forerunner, announcing that the Lord would come to the people.
    * **in the spirit and power of Elijah** - That is, "with the same spirit and power that Elijah had." It can also be translated as “and he will preach with the same strong character and authority that the prophet Elijah had.” The word "spirit" either refers to God's Holy Spirit or to Elijah's attitude or disposition. Make sure that the word "spirit" does not mean "ghost" or "evil spirit".
    * **turn the hearts of the fathers to their children** - Other ways to translate this are, "persuade fathers to care about their children again" or, "cause fathers to restore their relationships with their children." This would also apply to mothers, but only father's are named. Some would translate this as, "parents."
    * **walk** - That is "live" or, "behave."
    * **according to the wisdom of the righteous** - This can also be translated as "wisely as righteous people do."
    * **a people** - This can also be translated as "a group of people" or "many people."
    * **prepared for the Lord** - This can also be translated as "ready for when the Lord comes" or, "ready to believe the Lord's message" or, "ready to obey the Lord."
    * (This is the end of the angel's speech.)
