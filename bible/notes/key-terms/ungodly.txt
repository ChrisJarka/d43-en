====== ungodly, godlessness ======

===== Definition: =====

People or nations that are ungodly or godless do not obey God or even acknowledge God in their lives. The state of being ungodly is "ungodliness" and the state of being godless is "godlessness". The two terms have basically the same meaning.

  * God pronounces judgment and wrath on the ungodly and the godless, on everyone who rejects him and his ways.
  * Through Jesusâ€™ death and resurrection, God provided justification for the ungodly (that is, ungodly people).
