===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **God reigns over the nations; God sits on his holy throne** - Both of these phrase mean basically the same thing.  The a person who sits on a throne is also a person who reigns as a ruler. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **The princes of the peoples have gathered together to the people of the God of Abraham** - The princes are leaders of other nations and are used to refer to those nations. AT: "All the people of the earth have joined together with the people of the God of Abraham."
  * **shields of the earth belong to Yahweh**  - The word "shields" refers to the protection of an army. They belong to Yahweh because Yahweh is the one who controls their actions.  AT: "armies of the earth are controlled by Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
