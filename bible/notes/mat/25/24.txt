\v 24 Then the servant who had received one thousand dollars came. He said, 'Boss, I \add was afraid of you\add*. I knew that you are a man who does not do foolish things with his money. \add You even\add* take\add from others money\add* that does not really belong to you\add , like a farmer who\add* harvests \add grain from another man's field\add* where he did not even plant \add the seeds\add*.
\v 25 So because I was afraid \add of what you would do to me if I did not make a profit from my business\add*, I went out and hid your thousand dollars in the ground \add to keep it safe\add*. Here, this is \add the money\add* that belongs to you!'

\v 24 And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where
you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter;
\v 25 and I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth: lo, you have your own.
