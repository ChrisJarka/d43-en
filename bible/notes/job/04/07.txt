====== Job 04:7-9 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 7 Think about this: Do innocent people die \add while they are still young\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \q2 Does God get rid of godly people \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \add No\add*! \q1 \v 8 What I have experienced is this: \add Just as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* farmers who plant bad \add seeds\add* do not harvest \add good crops\add*, \q2 \add those who start\add* trouble for others later bring trouble on themselves. \q1 \v 9 They die when God blows his breath on them, \q2 when he is very angry with them. \q1 </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 7 Think about this: No innocent people ever die when they are still young! \q2 God never kills innocent people! \q1 \v 8 I have seen this happen: if farmers plant bad seeds, they do not harvest good crops; \q2 anyone who starts trouble for others later brings trouble on himself. \q1 \v 9 These people die when God commands them to, \q2 because he is very angry with them.

\q1 </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \q \v 7 Think about this, I beg you: who has ever perished when innocent? \q Or when was the upright person ever cut off? \q \v 8 Based on what I have observed, those who plow iniquity \q and sow trouble, reap the same. \q \v 9 By the breath of God they perish; \q by the blast of his anger they are consumed. </usfm>
