<usfm>
\v 7 \add One day I said this to Yahweh\add*:
\q1 "Yahweh, \add when you chose me to be a prophet\add*, you deceived me, and I allowed you to deceive me.
\q2 You insisted that I \add become a prophet\add* because you are stronger than I am.
\q1 And now everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* ridicules me.
\q2 They make fun of me all the day.
\q1
\v 8 When I tell \add people your messages\add*, I shout saying,
\q2 '\add Yahweh is going to cause you to experience\add* violence and destruction!'
\q1 So because I tell them those messages from you,
\q2 they insult me and scoff at me all the day.
\q1
\v 9 But if I would say, 'I will never mention Yahweh or say anything about him, \f + \ft metonymy \f*'
\q2 \add it would be as though\add* your message would burn in my inner being like \f + \ft simile \f* a fire;
\q2 it would be like a fire in my bones.
\q1 Sometimes I try to remain silent and not proclaim your messages,
\q2 but I am not able to do that.
\q1

\v 7 One day I said this to Yahweh:
\q1 "Yahweh, when you chose me to be a prophet, you deceived me so that I would agree to do this work.
\q2 You forced me to become a prophet.
\q1 But now everyone ridicules me.
\q2 They make fun of me all the day.
\q1
\v 8 When I tell people your messages, I shout saying,
\q2 'Yahweh is going to cause you to experience violence and destruction!'
\q1 So because I tell them those messages from you,
\q2 they insult me and scoff at me all the day.
\q1
\v 9 But if I would say, 'I will never mention Yahweh or say anything about him, '
\q2 it would be as though your message would burn in my inner being like a fire;
\q2 it would be like a fire in my bones.
\q1 Sometimes I try to remain silent and not proclaim your messages,
\q2 but I am not able to do that.

\q
\v 7 "Yahweh, you deceived me, and I was deceived. You are stronger than I, and you overpowered me.
\q I have become a laughingstock all day long; everyone mocks me.
\q
\v 8 For whenever I have spoken, I have called out and proclaimed, 'Violence and destruction.'
\q Then Yahweh's word has become for me reproach and mocking every day.
\q
\v 9 If I say, 'I will not think about Yahweh anymore. I will not speak any longer in his name.'
\q Then it is like a fire in my heart, held within my bones. So I struggle to contain it but I cannot.
