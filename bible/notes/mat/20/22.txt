\v 22 But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say
to him, We are able.
\v 23 He says to them, My cup indeed you shall drink: but to sit on my right hand, and on
my left hand, is not mine to give; but it is for them for whom it has been prepared of my Father.
\v 24 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren.
