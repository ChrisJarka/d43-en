  * **I will not fear harm** - "I will not be afraid of being hurt" or AT: "I will not fear evil"
  * **your rod and your staff comfort me** - David gives a picture of the way safety and discipline comfort. The shepherd used the rod to protect the sheep from danger and the staff to guide them along the path.
