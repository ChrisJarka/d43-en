===== Introduction to the Checking Manual =====

This module answers the question: What is the Checking Manual?\\
===== Translation Checking Manual =====

This manual describes how to check translated biblical content for accuracy, clarity, and naturalness.

**//Volume One// **

Volume One contains instructions for checking the translation that the translation team will use to check each other's work. If they follow these instructions, they will complete checking level one. Volume One also contains instructions for the translation team to use for checking the translation with the language community for clarity and naturalness, and for church leaders to use when they check the translation for accuracy. If they follow these instructions, they will complete checking level two. 

**//Volume Two// **

Volume Two contains further instructions for checking the translation that the church leaders can use to check the translation. These instructions are also for the leaders of church networks to use for checking the translation. Because many leaders of church networks do not speak the language of the translation, Volume Two also contains instructions for creating a back translation, which allows people to check a translation in a language that they do not speak.
