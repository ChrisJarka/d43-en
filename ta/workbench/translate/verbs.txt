Summary \\ 
Verbs tell the events happening and the state of things but also often who did it' the time, the manner in which it was done. Without verbs, you have no text!\\
  
Definition \\
Verbs either link the subject to a descriptive portion of the sentence or express an action or a state-of-being (e.g. am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been). Many languages use more verbs than English does.

•	English Parts of Speech
Verbs either link the subject to a descriptive portion of the sentence or express an action or a state-of-being (e.g. am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been). Many languages use more verbs than English does. In languages verbs frequently mark person, number, time, type of action (aspect), whether the action is done to something (voice) and mode although rarely does a language mark them all. Often these ideas are carried by other verbs or adverbs. Events are usually expressed by VERBS.

The context of the sentence determines the type of verb because some can function in different ways. For example, “The fish tasted oily,” uses tasted as a linking verb that describes the subject (the fish). “John tasted the fish” uses tasted as an action verb showing what the subject (John) did.
**person** Many languages have different forms to agree with the subject or in some languages the object. English only marks the present tense third person singular by adding an “s.” One exception is the verb “to be” which uses “am” for present tense first singular and “is” for third person singular. All the rest are “are,” In the past “was” for both first and third singular and “were” for all the rest. How does your language handles person? Is it in the verb or handles by nouns and pronouns?\\ 
Example \\ 
I translate, and he tranlate_s_\\ 
**Tense or time** English marks the past by adding “ed.” Unfortunately a number of common words are exceptions and have different past tenses. The future is marked by putting the verb “will” before the verb. When there are two times, the earlier time is marked by adding the verb “to have.” How is time handled in your language: in the verb or with a time word like “yesterday” or “already?”\\ 
Example  \\ 
•	They hear the train coming.
•	They heard the train come an hour ago.
•	Tomorrow they will hear two trains coming.
•	They have heard the train every day since they moved to town.
**aspect** English has two aspects the completive for actions as a whole; and the continuative which is marked by the verb “to be” for ongoing action. All other aspectual ideas are handled by adverbs. How does your language mark aspectual like ideas; in the verb or with special verbs or adverbs?\\ 
Example: 
•	I translate every Sunday. 
•	I am translating the Bible right now. \\ 
**mode** \\ 
Mode is the difference between statement, question, command and wish. Mode is marked in English by a special group of verbs called **modal verbs**. These create special challenges as most have two or more different meanings.. These verbs function in different ways in sentences; their purpose can only be determined in context. Modal verbs can be used to convey responsibilities, expectations, inferences, possibilities or needs. Several examples are giving below. Modal verbs include: can, may, must, will and shall and their past tenses: could, might, must, would and should. Here are some examples of difficulty of **modal verbs** in English. How do you handle mode in your language?\\ 
**Can and May.** The verb “can” shows ability or power; “may” is a modal verb involves permission or possibility. Examples: 
•	'I can read' states a fact.
•	'May I read now?' seeks permission to read.
•	'That may be perfect' means 'It could be perfect.'

**Must.** Like 'can' and 'may' this is a 'modal verb.' The context of the sentence is important to understanding the meaning. Must can show an obligation or an opinion/assumption of the speaker. 
•	I must call my pastor. In this case, must indicates a responsibility.
•	He must be overwhelmed with calls. In this sentence, must indicates a strong assumption/belief about the person spoken of.

**Has to.** This is another modal verb that must be considered in context. It can denote obligation, opinion/inference/assumption or need. 
•	He has to finish the test. (Obligation)
•	He has to be nearly done. (Inference/assumption)
•	He has to have insulin. (Personal need)

This module answers the question: What are verbs?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech|English Parts of Speech]]

Verbs either link the subject to a descriptive portion of the sentence or express an action or a state-of-being (e.g. am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been). Many languages use more verbs than English does. The portion of the sentence which contains the verb is called the predicate.\\ 
\\ 
Events are usually expressed by **VERBS**.\\ 
\\ 
The context of the sentence determines the type of verb because some can function in different ways. For example, "The fish tasted oily," uses tasted as a linking verb that describes the subject (the fish). "John tasted the fish" uses tasted as an action verb showing what the subject (John) did.\\ 
\\ 
Some verbs require a 'helper' and thus become a verb phrase. Examples include: am eating, are running, have been eating, will be eating.
==== Verb Tense ====
Just as time can be expressed as past, present and future, verbs also have these tenses. The verb reflects when the action takes place. Perfect tenses of verbs indicate continuing action (either continuous from a time past or continuous into the future).
==== Verbs and Objects ====
All sentences have a SUBJECT (PARTICIPANT), VERB (EVENT), and OBJECT (PARTICIPANT). English grammar allows for not stating the object of the verb so that the sentence may only have the SUBJECT (PARTICIPANT) and VERB (EVENT) stated.\\
Examples:
  * '//He has been **singing**  for three hours//.'  The object is not stated.
  * '//He has been **singing** __hymns__  for three hours.//'   "Hymns" is the object of "singing."
Note that different languages have different [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_order|orders]] for these parts of the sentences. In the examples below, the subject is first, the verb is bold, and the object is underlined. \\ 
\\ 
In English, it is sometimes ok to leave out the object when the object is not important in the sentence.
  * He **sang** __a song__.
  * He likes to **sing**.
In some languages, a verb that needs an object must always take one, even if the object is not very important. In all of these sentences, English can leave out the object.
  * He likes to **sing** __songs__.
  * He likes to **cook** __food__.
  * He has not **eaten** __anything__  in three days.
  * He is blind. He cannot **see** __anything__.
Sometimes you may need to include an object even if there is no object in English.
==== Singular & Plural Subjects - Verb Agreement ====
Nouns and Pronouns have the ability to be either singular (meaning "one") or plural (meaning "more than one"). For the majority of English words, plurals are formed simply by adding an 's' to the root word.\\ 
\\ 
The [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_singularpronouns|Singular Pronouns]] & [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pluralpronouns|Plural Pronouns]] pages have more information. Basically, singular pronouns include I, you, he, she and it. Plural pronouns include you, they and we. "It" refers back to nouns (the antecedent) which are non-human. There are collective nouns which describe quantities in excess of one but which remain singular in treatment; for example, team refers to several people. However, in a sentence, team is singular. (e.g. The team is tired.)\\ 
\\ 
Verb agreement requires matching singular subjects with singular verbs. An example:
  * 'The voter is angry.' One voter (singular) uses a singular verb (is).
  * 'The voters are angry.' Many voters (plural) uses a plural verb (are).
Most of the time in English:
  * Nouns that are plural have an 's' on the end; verbs that are plural do not.
  * Singular verbs typically have an 's' on the end and their subject will not (e.g. A dog eats. Two dogs eat.)
Pronouns work the same way; it is important to use the right verb for each of the pronouns. The chart below shows the "Be" verb (in present and past tense) with each of the pronouns; the first four are singular in form and the remaining ones are plural.
|**Pronoun**   |**Present**   |**Past**   |
|I |am |was |
|he |is |was |
|she |is |was |
|it |is |was |
|you |are |were |
|they |are |were |
|we |are |were |
==== Modal Verbs ====
A special group of verbs called //**modal verbs**// create special challenges. These verbs function in different ways in sentences; their purpose can only be determined in context. Modal verbs can be used to convey responsibilities, expectations, inferences, possibilities or needs. Several examples are giving below under **English Oddities**.
Modal verbs include: can, may, must, should, would
==== Some English Verb Oddities ====
**Can and May**. The verb "can" shows ability or power; "may" is a modal verb involves permission or possibility. Examples:
   * 'I can read' states a fact.
  * 'May I read now?' seeks permission to read.
  * 'That may be perfect' means 'It could be perfect.'
 \\ **Must. **  Like 'can' and 'may' this is a 'modal verb.' The context of the sentence is important to understanding the meaning. **//Must//** can show an obligation or an opinion/assumption of the speaker.
  * I **must **  call my pastor. In this case, //must //  indicates a responsibility.
  * He **must**  be overwhelmed with calls. In this sentence, //must//  indicates a strong assumption/belief about the person spoken of.
 \\ **Has to. **  This is another modal verb that must be considered in context. It can denote obligation, opinion/inference/assumption or need.
  * He has to finish the test. (Obligation)
  * He has to be nearly done. (Inference/assumption)
  * He has to have insulin. (Personal need)
**Teach and Learn**. These verbs are partners. Teaching imparts knowledge. Learning means getting knowledge.\\ 
\\ 
**Sit, Sat and Set**. These verbs are often confused. "Sit" is used to convey resting or being seated. "Set" means to place something. "Sat" is the past tense for sit. "Set" stays the same in both present and past tense. Examples:
  * 'I sit on a chair.' means 'I rest on a chair.'
  * 'I set my book on the table.' means 'I place my book on the table.' (or, 'I placed my book on the table')
