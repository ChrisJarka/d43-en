\v 1 And the high priest said, Are these things so?
\v 2 And he said,
\p Brethren and fathers, hearken: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he
lived in Haran,
\v 3 and said to him, Get you out of your land, and from your kindred, and come into the land which I shall show you.
\v 4 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead,
God removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell:
\v 5 and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to
him in possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.
\v 6 And God spoke on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage,
and treat them ill, four hundred years.
\v 7 And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve
me in this place.
\v 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham
became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac
became the father of Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
\v 9 And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God was with him,
\v 10 and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him
governor over Egypt and all his house.
\v 11 Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.
\v 12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time.
\v 13 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s race became manifest to Pharaoh.
\v 14 And Joseph sent, and called to him Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
\v 15 And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, himself and our fathers;
\v 16 and they were carried over to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of
Hamor in Shechem.
\v 17 But as the time of the promise drew near which God vouchsafed to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
\v 18 till there arose another king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
\v 19 The same dealt craftily with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babes to the end they
might not live.
\v 20 At which season Moses was born, and was exceeding fair; and he was nourished three months in his father’s house:
\v 21 and when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
\v 22 And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works.
\v 23 But when he was well-nigh forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
\v 24 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, striking the Egyptian:
\v 25 and he supposed that his brethren understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they understood not.
\v 26 And the day following he appeared to them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, you are
brethren; why do you wrong one to another?
\v 27 But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
\v 28 Wouldest you kill me, as you killedst the Egyptian yesterday?
\v 29 And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.
\v 30 And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a
bush.
\v 31 And when Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord,
\v 32 I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and dared not behold.
\v 33 And the Lord said to him, Loose the shoes from your feet: for the place whereon you stand is holy ground.
\v 34 I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I am come down to
deliver them: and now come, I will send you into Egypt.
\v 35 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? him has God sent
to be both a ruler and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.
\v 36 This man led them forth, having wrought wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty
years.
\v 37 This is that Moses, who said to the children of Israel, A prophet shall God raise up to you from among your brethren,
like to me.
\v 38 This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him in the mount Sinai, and with our
fathers: who received living oracles to give to us:
\v 39 to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,
\v 40 saying to Aaron, Make us gods that shall go before us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of
Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
\v 41 And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
\v 42 But God turned, and gave them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets,
\q Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices
\q Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
\q
\v 43 And you took up the tabernacle of Moloch,
\q And the star of the god Rephan,
\q The figures which you made to worship them:
\q And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
\m
\v 44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spoke to Moses, that he
should make it according to the figure that he had seen.
\v 45 Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the possession of the nations, that
God thrust out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David;
\v 46 who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.
\v 47 But Solomon built him a house.
\v 48 Howbeit the Most High lives not in houses made with hands; as says the prophet,
\q
\v 49 The heaven is my throne,
\q And the earth the footstool of my feet:
\q What manner of house will you build me? says the Lord:
\q Or what is the place of my rest?
\q
\v 50 Did not my hand make all these things?
\p
\v 51 You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do you.
\v 52 Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed them that showed before of the coming of the
Righteous One; of whom you have now become betrayours and murderers;
\v 53 you who received the law as it was ordained by angels, and kept it not.
\p
\v 54 Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.
\v 55 But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on
the right hand of God,
\v 56 and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
\v 57 But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord;
\v 58 and they cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man
named Saul.
\v 59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon the Lord, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
\v 60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he
fell asleep.
