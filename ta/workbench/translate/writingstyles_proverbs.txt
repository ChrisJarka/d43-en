===== Description =====
**Proverbs** are short concise statements of wisdom, often using metaphor and parallelism. **Riddles** are short hidden statements of truth that the hearer has to guess its meaning. \\ 
Example of a proverb: **Look at the ant, you lazy person, consider her ways, and be wise.** (Proverbs 6:6)  \\ 
**Reason this is a translation issue:** \\
Each language has its own way of stating proverbs. There are many proverbs in the Bible. They need to be put in the form of your language proverbs for people to recognize them as proverbs.

==== Translation Principles  (optional) ====

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**ULB Text.** (Proverbs 22:1) - **A good name is to be chosen over great riches, and favor is better than silver and gold.** This is a proverb as it is a short bit of wisdom. \\
\\
**(1 Corinthians 15:55) Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?"** This is a proverb because in these short words it gives the wisdom that death is no longer final.
