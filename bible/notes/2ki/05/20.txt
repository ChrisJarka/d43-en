\v 20 But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not
receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Jehovah liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.
\v 21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and
said, Is all well?
\v 22 And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of
Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.
