\v 16 Then he said to me, "You human, I will cause the supply of food to Jerusalem to be cut off. Then the people will eat the small amounts of food and drink the small amounts of water \add that the government permits them to have\add*, and they will be very distressed and anxious as they do that,
\v 17 because water and food will be very scarce. They will see each other becoming extremely thin, and they will be appalled; but this will happen because \add they are being punished for\add* the sins \add that they have committed\add*."
