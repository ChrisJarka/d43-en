====== Parables ======

The word parable in Greek (and its Hebrew counterpart) has a fairly broad meaning.  Concepts translated as "parable" include narrative stories, metaphors, similes, proverbs and even riddles.  In the broadest sense, parables are a "general term for a figurative saying."  When you encounter a parable, know that the intent is to convey meaning through a story or word picture.   A parable is not an actual account of an event; it is more like a hypothetical situation (e.g. This could happen...).  Parables seldom (if ever) contain the names of specific individuals (That may be a key for you in identifying what is a parable vs what is a narrative account.)   The [[http://door43.org/en/ta/figuresofspeech/metaphor?s[]=simile|Metaphor and Simile page ]]may help in understanding the concept of parables; however, the translation tips are specific for those situations.

Parable stories are best translated as a story that can be understood within your own culture.  The culture of the Biblical writer impacts any parable story, so full understanding of the parable prior to translation is necessary.  The power of a Parable is to touch a heart with conviction in a way that a pointed, direct teaching may be unable to do.  A parable allows the reader to experience a truth in a non-threatening way.  The lesson comes in a story a reader understands and can feel themselves being a part of...and the meaning of the story then settles into their heart.

~~DISCUSSION~~

Hi, all.  I've tried to craft a parable description above using the things you wrote (below).  I moved it below the DISCUSSION bar for clarity sake.  If this does not address your concerns, please let me know.

Actually, the tA page for translating parables might be very short. I’m not wording this well yet, but it could teach people __not__ to explain the story or what Jesus was teaching, but simply to translate the story as a story. Their language may have a way of communicating that a narrative is a story (or even a story whose purpose is to teach something) and not an account of a historical event.

There’s another issue. Not all things that are called parables in Greek are stories. Perhaps we could just refer to them as ”situations” (This might even overlap with the idea of hypothetical situations.)

__Lu 4:23__* And he said unto them, Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in thine own country.

__Lu 5:36__* And he spake also a parable unto them: No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment; else he will rend the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old.

__Lu 6:39__* And he spake also a parable unto them, Can the blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit?

The following passage seems to be a combination of a parable and simile. Jesus actually used the words ”compare” and ”like” so it seems to be a simile. But the translation suggestions on the page for Simile would not be appropriate here.

Luke 7:31,32

"To what then should I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like? 32They are like children playing in the marketplace, who sit and call to one another and say, 'We played a flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned, and you did not weep.'
