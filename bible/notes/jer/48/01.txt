\p
\v 1 Of Moab. Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe to Nebo! for it is laid waste; Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken; Misgab is put to shame and broken down.
\v 2 The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her: Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation. You also, O Madmen, shall be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue thee.
