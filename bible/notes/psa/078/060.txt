===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to describe what God did for the people of Israel.

  * **He allowed his strength to be captured and gave his glory into the enemy's hand** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Both refer to the ark of the covenant decrees. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **into the enemy's hand** - to the power or control of the enemy (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
