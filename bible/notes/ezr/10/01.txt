\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered
together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore.
\v 2 And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have trespassed against our God,
and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.
