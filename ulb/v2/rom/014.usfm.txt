\c 14
\p
\v 1 But him that is weak in faith receive ye, yet not for decision of scruples.
\v 2 One man has faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eats herbs.
\v 3 Let not him that eats set at nothing him that eats not; and let not him that eats not judge him that eats: for God
has received him.
\v 4 Who are you that judge the servant of another? to his own lord he stands or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand;
for the Lord has power to make him stand.
\v 5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day
alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.
\v 6 He that regards the day, regards it to the Lord: and he that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks;
and he that eats not, to the Lord he eats not, and gives God thanks.
\v 7 For none of us lives to himself, and none dieth to himself.
\v 8 For whether we live, we live to the Lord; or whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we
are the Lord’s.
\v 9 For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
\v 10 But you, why do you judge your brother? or you again, why do you set at nothing your brother? for we shall all stand
before the judgment-seat of God.
\v 11 For it is written,
\q As I live, says the Lord, to me every knee shall bow,
\q And every tongue shall confess to God.
\m
\v 12 So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.
\p
\v 13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge you this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his
brother’s way, or an occasion of falling.
\v 14 I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything
to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
\v 15 For if because of meat your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love. Destroy not with your meat him for whom
Christ died.
\v 16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
\v 17 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
\v 18 For he that herein serves Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.
\v 19 So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.
\v 20 Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eats
with offence.
\v 21 It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything
whereby your brother stumbleth.
\v 22 The faith which you hast, have you to yourself before God. Happy is he that judges not himself in that which he
approveth.
\v 23 But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he eats
not of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin.
