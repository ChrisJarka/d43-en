\v 8 And if Jehovah your God enlarge your border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and give you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers;
\v 9 if you shall keep all this commandment to do it, which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shall you add three cities more for thee, besides these three:
\v 10 that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of your land, which Jehovah your God gives you for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.
