<usfm>
\v 13 You should not be amazed\f + \ft Or: surprised \f*, my fellow believers, when \add unbelievers\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* hate you.
\v 14 We know that we have been changed from \add being spiritually\add* dead \f + \ft metaphor \f* to \add being spiritually\add* alive. We know this because we love our fellow believers. \add Those who\add* do not love \add their fellow believers\add* are still \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* dead.
\v 15 Those who hate \add any of\add* their fellow believers, \add God considers\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* them \add to be\add* murderers. And you know that no murderer has eternal life.

\v 13 You should not be amazed when unbelievers hate you.
\v 14 Because we love our fellow believers, we know that God has made us to live forever with him. But God regards anyone who does not love them as dead.
\v 15 God treats anyone who hates their fellow believers as though they had done something just as bad as committing murder. And you know that no murderer has eternal life.

\v 13 Do not be amazed, my brothers, if the world hates you.
\v 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death.
\v 15 Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer. And you know that eternal life does not remain in a murderer.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **brothers** - "fellow believers"
  * **if the world hates you** - Here the word "world" refers to the people who do not honor God. AT: "if those who do not honor God hate you who do honor God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **we have passed out of death into life** - "we are no longer spiritually dead but are spiritually alive"
  * **life** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:01:01|1:1-2]].
  * **remains in death** - "is still spiritually dead"
  * **Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer** - This compares a person who hates another believer with a murderer. Since hatred is the cause of murder, God considers anyone who hates to be as guilty as someone who kills a person. AT: "Whoever hates another believer is as guilty as someone who kills a person." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **eternal life does not remain in a murderer** - "Eternal life" is something God gives believers after they die, but it is also a power God gives believers in this life to help them to stop sinning and to do what please him. AT: "a murderer does not have the power of spiritual life working inside of him."
