====== Hebrews 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 7:17,21, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== High priest ==
Jesus needed to be a high priest to offer his life as a sacrifice for sin. Jesus' role as high priest is explained in detail in this chapter.

== Melchizedek ==
The high priest was normally from the tribe of Levi, but Jesus was from the ruling tribe, Judah. His right to be a priest came from the tradition of Melchizedek, who was a priest before the Levites came into existence. This passage will be difficult to understand if Genesis has not been translated first (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== New covenant ==
The author mentions the [[:en:obe:kt:newcovenant|new covenant]] and discusses Jesus' relationship to it.
