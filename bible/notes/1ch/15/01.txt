===== translationNotes: =====

  * **David built houses for himself ... He prepared** - It might be best to translate this so that the reader understands that David had other people do this for him. AT: "David had workers build houses for him ... He had them prepare" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **they had been chosen by Yahweh** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh had chosen them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem** - Here the word "all" is a generalization. The phrase "all Israel" means that David assembled people from all over Israel, not that he assembled every person in Israel. AT: "David assembled at Jerusalem people from all over Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
