====== Plural Pronouns ======


**Plural pronouns replace plural nouns â€” those that name more than one person, place, thing, or idea.** 


//**Plural Definite Pronouns**//:


    * we/us - (from //Singular//: I/me) these words can be [[:en:ta:vocabulary:exclusive|exclusive]] or [[:en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive|inclusive ]]based on context
    * they/them (from //Singular//: he/him/she/her/it)


In Standard English, "you" can be either //Singular // or //Plural//, depending on context. For clarification, 'all' is used to form expressions like "you all" or "all of you".


//**Plural Demonstrative Pronouns:** // 


    * these (from //Singular//: 'this')
    * those (from //Singular//: 'that')


//**Plural Reflexive Pronouns:** // 


    * ourselves - this word can be [[:en:ta:vocabulary:exclusive|exclusive]] or [[:en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive|inclusive]] based on context
    * yourselves (from //Singular//: 'yourself')
    * themselves


Unlike some languages, English does not have //Dual Pronouns//, which refer to two people only. If clarification is necessary, the following expressions are used:


    * //1st Person Dual//: us two/us both/both of us - these phrases can be [[:en:ta:vocabulary:exclusive|exclusive]] or [[:en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive|inclusive]] based on context
    * //1st Person Dual//: you and I - this phrase is strictly [[:en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive|inclusive]]
    * //2nd Person Dual//: you two/you both/both of you
    * //2nd Person Dual/3rd Person Dual//: each other/one another
    * 3rd Person Dual: those two


//**Plural Indefinite Pronouns:** // 


    * everyone/everybody - (from //Singular//: 'anyone/anybody' or 'someone/somebody')


//Relative Pronouns//  (who/whom, that, which) can refer to //Singular // or //Plural // entities.


"The __man who__  went to the store got lost."


"The __men who__  went to the store got lost."
