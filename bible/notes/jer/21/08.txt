====== Jeremiah 21:8-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 And tell this to all the people: 'Yahweh says that you must decide whether you want to die or to remain alive.
\v 9 Everyone who remains in Jerusalem will die. They will be killed in battles or die from being hungry or from diseases. But those who surrender to the army of Babylon that is surrounding your city will remain alive. They will escape dying.
\v 10 This will happen because I, Yahweh, have decided to cause this city to experience disasters, not to experience something good. The army of the king of Babylon will capture this city and will destroy it completely by fire.'~"

\v 8 And to this people you shall say, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
\v 9 He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goes out, and
passes over to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.
\v 10 For I have set my face upon this city for evil, and not for good, says Jehovah: it shall be given into the hand of the
king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
