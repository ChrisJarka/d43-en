\v 30 Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Why do you make yourselves unclean with the ways of your fathers? And whore 
about after detestable things?
\v 31 For when you lift up your gifts and cause your sons to pass through the fire, you make yourselves unclean with all your idols unto this day. So 
should I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live,’—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—‘I will not be inquired of by you!
\v 32 The thing going up into your spirit will not be real, as you say, “Let us be as the nations, as the families of the lands to serve wood and stone!”
