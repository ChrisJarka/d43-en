\v 4 Or, what about the eighteen people who died when the tower at Siloam outside Jerusalem fell on them. Do you think that this happened to them because they were worse sinners than everyone else in Jerusalem?
\v 5 I assure you, that was not the reason! But instead, you need to realize that God will similarly punish you if you do not turn from your sinful behavior!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues speaking to the crowd.)
  * **Or those **  - This can start with "Or consider those" or "Think about those." This is Jesus' second example of people who suffered. It can also be translated as a rhetorical question to introduce the example: "What about those."
  * **do you think they were worse sinners** - This starts off a rhetorical question. It can be translated as "were they worse sinners." Jesus was drawing their attention to something that they believed. It can be translated as a statement: “You think that they were more sinful than all the other men in Jerusalem ” or “You think that this proves that they were more sinful.” (See: Rhetorical Question)
   * **No, I say** - Jesus said “I tell you” here to emphasize “No.” Possible meanings are “They certainly were not more sinful” or “Their suffering certainly does not prove that they were more sinful.” It can be translated as “You are wrong to think that.”
all of you will perish in the same way - “all of you will also perish.” The phrase “in the same way” means “with the same result,” not “by the same method.”
  * **other men**  - "other people"
  * **No, I say **  - "I tell you they were not" or "Definitely not" or "Certainly not"
