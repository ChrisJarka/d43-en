\v 24 The men from Gibeon replied, "We lied to you because we were afraid that you would kill us. We heard that Yahweh, your God, declared to his servant Moses that he would enable you to conquer all the people in this land and to kill all the people who lived in it.
\v 25 So now you can decide what you will do with us. Do what you think is right."

\v 24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told your servants, how that Jehovah your God commanded his
servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore
afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
\v 25 And now, behold, we are in your hand: as it seems good and right to you to do to us, do.
