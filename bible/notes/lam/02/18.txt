\q1 Do not stop grieving;
\q2 do not stop crying."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 18 Their heart cried out to the Lord,
\q walls of the daughter of Zion! Make your tears flow down like a river day and night.
\q Give yourself no relief, your eyes no relief.
\q
\v 19 Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the night watches!
\q Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord.
\q Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children who faint with hunger at the corner of every street."
