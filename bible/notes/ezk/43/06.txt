<usfm> \p \v 6 Then I heard one speaking to me from the house, and there was a man standing beside me. \v 7 He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet where I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel forever, and the house of Israel will no longer profane my holy name—they or their kings with their promiscuity and with the corpses of their kings in their high places; \v 8 with the setting of their thresholds with my thresholds, and their gateposts beside my gateposts. For there was a wall between me and them yet they profaned my holy name with their abominations that they did so that I consumed them with my anger. </usfm>
