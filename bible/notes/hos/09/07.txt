\q1 This will happen because you have sinned so much
\q2 and because you have become Yahweh's enemies.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The days for punishment are coming; the days for retribution are coming. **- "retribution" means "deserved punishment" - The prophet Hosea uses these two ways of emphasizing that Israel would soon be judged by Yahweh for their evil deeds. (see: Parallelism)
  * **"The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane," because of your great iniquity and great hostility. **- The people of Israel had sinned so much (iniquity) that they were actively against God in everything they did (hostility).  Because of this, they thought that everything the prophet said was foolish and everything he did was crazy.
