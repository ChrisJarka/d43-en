\v 1 Ephraim feedeth on wind, and follows after the east wind: he continually multiplies lies and desolation; and they make
a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.
\v 2 Jehovah has also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he

\v 3 In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God:
\v 4 yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication to him: he found him at Beth-el, and

\v 12 And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept
sheep.
\v 13 And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
\v 14 Ephraim has provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord
return to him.
