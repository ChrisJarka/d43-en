====== biblical time ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, terms used to explain time include "watch" and "hour."

In biblical times, a **watch** was a period of time at night during which a watchman or guard for a city would be on duty looking out for any threat from an enemy.

   * In the Old Testament, the Israelites had three watches which were called "beginning" (sunset to 10 pm) "middle" (10 pm to 2 am) and "morning" (2 am to sunrise) watches.
  * In the New Testament, the Jews followed the Roman system and had four watches, named simply "first" (sunset to 9pm) "second" (9pm to 12 midnight) "third" (12 midnight to 3am) and "fourth" (3am to sunrise) watches.

To tell more specifically what time a certain event took place, the term **hour** is often used in the Bible.

  * <font inherit/Arial, sans-serif;;inherit;;inherit>The Jews counted daylight hours starting at sunrise (around 6 am), so “the ninth hour” meant “around three in the afternoon” in the present-day system.</font>
  * <font inherit/Arial, sans-serif;;inherit;;inherit>Nighttime hours were counted starting at sunset (around</font> 6pm<font inherit/Arial, sans-serif;;inherit;;inherit>), so “the third hour of the night” meant “nine in the evening.”</font>
  * Since the time of sunrise and sunset varies, the time references will not correspond exactly to present-day times. So time expressions using hours could be translated with phrases such as “around nine” or “about six o'clock.”

More general time expressions include "early morning," "morning," "evening."

  * These could also be translated more generally with phrases such as, "early evening" or "late at night" or "the middle of the night."
