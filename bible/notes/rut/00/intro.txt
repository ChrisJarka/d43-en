**What is Ruth about?**\\

The book of Ruth is a biography of the principle character, Ruth, the daughter-in-law of Naomi. One of the purposes of the book is to show Ruth’s connection to King David. It also shows the blessings that came when God’s people faithfully followed the covenant, blessings that God often brought through the ordinary events of life. The story of Ruth has many lessons about faith, fidelity, self-sacrifice, and integrity.  

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
While these titles often describe the author or audience of the biblical book, “Ruth” is a reference to the book's main character. Many title choose to summarize the contents of the book. Translators should use a self-explanatory title such as, "The Book about Ruther," or that they imitate the way the title appears in regional or national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]). 

**Who wrote Ruth?**\\
The author of the book of Ruth is not stated. While many suggestions have been made, it is best to see the book as anonymous.

**When did the events of Ruth occur?**\\
The story of Ruth is set during the time when there were "judges" in Israel. These were certain men and women who became leaders over Israel or parts of Israel both in time of war and in time of peace.

**What type of writing is Ruth?**\\
This book does not place great importance on its historical aspects. Instead, it is written as a short story. The translator should attempt to preserve the narrative quality of the book. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
**Why does Scripture include a book about a woman from the foreign land of Moab?**\\
In a period when Israel is often [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful|unfaithful]] to Yahweh, he finds a woman from Moab who displays great faith in him. Their lack of faith in Yahweh is contrasted with the faith of one their enemies. While it is an Israelite, Boaz, who rescues Ruth from a life of solitude, it will be the Jesus the Messiah, one of Ruth's descendants, who will rescue Israel.

**What important marriage custom is found in the Book of Ruth?**\\
Israelites practiced what is called "levirate marriage." This was a custom for the closest male relative to provide for a related childless widow by marrying her. Any children coming from this union were to be regarded as children of the dead man, so that his line of descendants would continue. If the closest relative did not marry the woman, another relative could.

**What was a "kinsman-redeemer"?**\\
Someone's close relative or relatives were expected to act as "kinsmen-redeemers" for that person. They had the responsibility of providing for their relative who was in need, like the widow Ruth. In other situations, they had the responsibility of taking revenge on any criminal who dared to injure or kill one of their relatives. In the Book of Ruth, Boaz is one such kinsman-redeemer.

**What important agricultural custom is found in the Book of Ruth?**\\
There was a practice instituted in the Law of Moses called gleaning. This was a way for the very poor to get food by following after the men who harvested a field. These "gleaners" were allowed to pick up sheaves of grain that the harvesters missed or dropped by accident. Ruth became a gleaner in a field belonging to Boaz.

 
===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**What is the concept of [[:en:obe:kt:covenantfaith|covenant faith]] or covenant loyalty?**\\
This concept, which is very important in the Book of Ruth, is what parties in God's covenant with Israel were expected to have for each other: faithfulness and therefore even mercy and love. God promised that he would act in faithfulness and love for the Israelites, and the Israelites were to do the same toward him and toward each other. 

In the Book of Ruth, the obligations of kinsmen-redeemers to their relatives are shown to be part of the obligations in God's covenant with Israel. The actions of Boaz, Ruth and Naomi make them good examples to all of Israel of what covenant faithfulness can look like.

**What type of writing is Ruth?**\\
This book does not place great importance on its historical aspects. Instead, it is written as a short story. The translator should attempt to preserve the narrative quality of the book. The translator should try to maintain a tone which is able to easily keep the reader's attention. 

**How does Ruth shift from one topic to another topic?**\\
The book of Ruth has many transitions as it changes topics. The ULB uses the words "so," "then" and "now." It may be different to translate these words because of their similarity in meaning. Overall, the book should transition between topics easily.
