\v 8 And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad, surely thus says Jehovah, So will I give up Zedekiah the
king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of
Egypt,
\v 9 I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a
proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.
\v 10 And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I
gave to them and to their fathers.
