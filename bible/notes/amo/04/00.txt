====== Amos 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is written in poetic form about Yahweh's people refusal to listen to Him even as He tries to point them back to Himself. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

This chapter contains a repeated sentence: "Yet you have not returned to me â€”this is the declaration of Yahweh." Please make sure this sentence is translated the same way each time to show the repetition which appears like a list of sins Yahweh is mounting against His people. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

This chapter also names of places from different nations outside Israel as well places in the nation of Israel and Judah. As with other names like Egypt, please review [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]].
