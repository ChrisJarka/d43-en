====== Biblical Weight ======

===== Description =====

The following terms are the most common units of weight in the Bible. The term "shekel" means "weight" and many other weights are described in terms of the shekel. Some of these weights were used for money. The exact weights are uncertain, but the approximate amounts are:

  * Shekel - 11 grams
  * Bekah - (1/2 shekel) Not in ULB 
  * Pim - (2/3 shekel)  Not in ULB
  * Gerah - (1/20 of a shekel)
  * Mina - 600 grams (50 shekels)
  * Talent - 34 kilograms (60 minas, 3000 shekels)

^  Original Measure ^  Shekels ^ Grams ^ Kilograms |
|  shekel  |  1 shekel |  11 grams |  - |
|  bekah  |  1/2 shekel |  5.7 grams |   - |
|  pim  |  2/3 shekel |  7.6 grams |  - |
|  gerah  |  1/20 shekel |  - |  0.57 kilograms |
|  mina  |  50 shekels |  570 grams |  0.57 kilograms |
|  talent  |  3000 shekels |  - |  34 kilograms |

=== Translation Principles === 

  - The people in the Bible did not use modern measures such as meters, liters, and kilograms. Using the original measures can help readers know that the Bible really was written long ago in a time when people used those measures.
  - Using modern measures can help readers understand the text more easily.
  - Whatever measure you use, it would be good, if possible, to tell about the other kind of measure in the text or a footnote.

==== Translation Strategies ==== 

  - Use the measurements from the ULB. These are the same kinds of measurements that the original writers used. Spell them in a way that is similar to the way they sound or are spelled in the ULB. (See: Copy or Borrow Words)
  - Use the metric measurements given in the UDB. The translators of the UDB have already figured how to represent the amounts in the metric system.
  - Use measurements that are already used in your language. In order to do this you would need to know how your measurements relate to the metric system and figure out each measurement.
  - Use the measurements from the ULB and include measurements that your people know in the text or a note.
  - Use measurements that your people know, and include the measurements from the ULB in the text or in a note.
