===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The young woman continues to describe the man.

  * **His eyes are like doves** - One possible is that the Israelites considered doves to be gentle and soft birds, and the woman considers the man's eyes beautiful because the way the man looks at her makes her think he is gentle. Translate "eyes are like doves" as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:15|1:15]]. AT: "He is very gentle" Another possibility is that the woman is speaking of the man's white eyeballs or the shape of his eyes, the shape of a dove. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **doves beside streams of water** - Birds that the Israelites considered gentle sitting beside a gently flowing stream are a metaphor for a gentle person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **streams of water** - "gently flowing water"
  * **bathed in milk** - Doves are a metaphor for the man's pupils, and milk is a metaphor for the whites of the man's eyes. You may need to supply the words omitted by the ellipsis. AT: "his pupils are washing themselves in milk" or "his pupils are surrounded by milk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **mounted like jewels** - His eyes are beautiful. Jewels that a craftsman has carefully put in place are beautiful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
