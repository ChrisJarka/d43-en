<usfm>
\q
\v 9 Be you not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding;
\q Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in,
\q Else they will not come near to thee.
\q
\v 10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked;
\q But he that trusts in Jehovah, lovingkindness shall compass him about.
