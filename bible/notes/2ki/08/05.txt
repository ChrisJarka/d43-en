\v 5 Then as he was telling the king how Elisha had restored to life the child who was dead, the very woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land. So Gehazi said, "My master, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life."
\v 6 And when the king asked the woman about her son, she explained it to him. So the king appointed for her a certain officer, saying, "Restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now."
