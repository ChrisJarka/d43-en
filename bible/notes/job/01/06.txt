<usfm> \p \v 6 Now it came about that on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan also came among them. \v 7 Yahweh said to Satan, “From where are you coming?” Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down on it.” \v 8 Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil.” </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now it came about…**  - "Now it happened…" The word "Now" is used here to introduce new information. (See:Now)
  * **sons of God**  - This is referring to "angels" or "heavenly beings"
  * **to present themselves ****before Yahweh **- "to stand together before Yahweh"
  * **going to and fro**  - "going from one place to another then back again"
  * **in the earth**  - This can be translated "on the earth" as Satan is not physically moving inside the earth, but is moving around on the surface as people do.
  * **…going to and fro…walking up and down…**  - This is an example of parallelism as both phrases mean basically the same thing (See: Parallelism)
  * **Have you considered my servant Job? - **"Have you thought about my servant Job?" God was not expecting Satan to answer this question. He wants to talk about Job to Satan. (See: Rhetorical question)
