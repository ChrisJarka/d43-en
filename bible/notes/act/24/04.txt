===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Tertullus continues to speak to governor Felix.)
  * **so that I detain you no more**  - This could have the sense of detaining in sense of time as UDB translated or it could be in sense of tiring someone out. Alternate translation "so that I do not make you tired," or "so that I not hinder you any longer," This was a common way to start a speech.
  * **briefly listen**  - "listen to my short speech". Orators commonly promised their audiences that they would only speak briefly.
  * **we have found this man**  - "we observed Paul" or "we discovered that Paul"
  * **tried to desecrate the temple**  - "tried to religiously dishonor the temple;"
  * **verses 6b-8a **- These verses were altered because some of the older, more reliable, ancient texts did not include them in this form. "[6b] And we wanted to judge him according to our own Law. [7] But the commander Lysias came, and with great violence took him out of our hands. [8b] He then ordered his accusers to come and appear before you." [See: Original manuscripts]
