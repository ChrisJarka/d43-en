\v 1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him:
\v 2 and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
\p
\v 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
\p
\v 5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
\p
\v 6 Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
\p
\v 7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
\p
\v 8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
\p
\v 9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.
\p
\v 10 Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousnessâ€™ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\v 11 Blessed are you when men shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely,
for my sake.
\v 12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets that were before
you.
\p
\v 13 You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good
for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid.
\v 15 Neither do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth to all that are in
the house.
\v 16 Even so let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
\p
\v 17 Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil.
\v 18 For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the
law, till all things be accomplished.
\v 19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the
kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 20 For I say to you, that except your righteousness shall exceed
the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\p
\v 21 You have heard that it was said to them of old time, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of
the judgment:
\v 22 but I say to you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever shall
say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of the hell
of fire.
\v 23 If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against thee,
\v 24 leave there your gift before the altar, and go your way, first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your
gift.
\v 25 Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver you to the
judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.
\v 26 Verily I say to thee, You shall by no means come out thence, till you have paid the last farthing.
\p
\v 27 You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery:
\v 28 but I say to you, that every one that looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in
his heart.
\v 29 And if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one
of your members should perish, and not your whole body be cast into hell.
\v 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one
of your members should perish, and not your whole body go into hell.
\v 31 It was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
\v 32 but I say to you, that every one that puts away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, makes her an
adulteress: and whoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery.
\p
\v 33 Again, you have heard that it was said to them of old time, You shall not forswear thyself, but shall perform to the
Lord your oaths:
\v 34 but I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God;
\v 35 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
\v 36 Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can not make one hair white or black.
\v 37 But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatever is more than these is of the evil
one.
\p
\v 38 You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
\v 39 but I say to you, Resist not him that is evil: but whoever smiteth you on your right cheek, turn to him the other
also.
\v 40 And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.
\v 41 And whoever shall compel you to go one mile, go with him two.
\v 42 Give to him that asks you, and from him that would borrow of you turn not you away.
\p
\v 43 You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy:
\v 44 but I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you;
\v 45 that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends
rain on the just and the unjust.
\v 46 For if you love them that love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans the same?
\v 47 And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more than others?
do not even the Gentiles the same?
\v 48 You therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
