\c 12
\p
\v 1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
\v 2 You know that when you were Gentiles you were led away to those dumb idols, howsoever you might be led.
\v 3 Wherefore I make known to you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say,
Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
\v 5 And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.
\v 6 And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.
\v 7 But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.
\v 8 For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same
Spirit:
\v 9 to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;
\v 10 and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits: to another
various kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:
\v 11 but all these works the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.
\p
\v 12 For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is
Christ.
\v 13 For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to
drink of one Spirit.
\v 14 For the body is not one member, but many.
\v 15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
\v 16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
\v 17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
\v 18 But now has God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.
\v 19 And if they were all one member, where were the body?
\v 20 But now they are many members, but one body.
\v 21 And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
\v 22 Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:
\v 23 and those parts of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and
our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness;
\v 24 whereas our comely parts have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that
part which lacked;
\v 25 that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
\v 26 And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or
one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
\v 27 Now you are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.
\v 28 And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of
healings, helps, governments, various kinds of tongues.
\v 29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
workers of miracles?
\v 30 have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
\v 31 But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I to you.
