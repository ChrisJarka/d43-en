\v 12 The flowers appear on the earth;
\q The time of the singing of birds is come,
\q And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;
\q
\v 13 The fig tree ripeneth her green figs,
\q And the vines are in blossom;
\q They give forth their fragrance.
\q Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
