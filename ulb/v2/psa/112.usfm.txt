\c 112
\q
\v 1 Praise you Jehovah.
\q Blessed is the man that fears Jehovah,
\q That delights greatly in his commandments.
\q
\v 2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth:
\q The generation of the upright shall be blessed.
\q
\v 3 Wealth and riches are in his house;
\q And his righteousness endures for ever.
\q
\v 4 To the upright there arises light in the darkness:
\q He is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
\q
\v 5 Well is it with the man that deals graciously and lendeth;
\q He shall maintain his cause in judgment.
\q
\v 6 For he shall never be moved;
\q The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.
\q
\v 7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings:
\q His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.
\q
\v 8 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid,
\q Until he see his desire upon his adversaries.
\q
\v 9 He has dispersed, he has given to the needy;
\q His righteousness endures for ever:
\q His horn shall be exalted with honor.
\q
\v 10 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved;
\q He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away:
\q The desire of the wicked shall perish.
