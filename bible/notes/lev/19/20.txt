\v 20 And whoever lies carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
\v 21 And he shall bring his trespass-offering to Jehovah, to the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a trespass-offering.
\v 22 And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before Jehovah for his sin which he has sinned: and the sin which he has sinned shall be forgiven him.
