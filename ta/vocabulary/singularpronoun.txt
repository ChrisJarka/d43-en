====== Singular Pronouns ======

**Singular pronouns replace singular nouns, which are those that name one person, place, thing, or idea.**

//**Singular Personal Pronouns** //**//:// **

//Personal Pronouns// refer to people.

   * //1st Person Singular Personal Pronoun//: **I/me**  - refers to the //Speaker//
  * //2nd Person Singular Personal Pronoun//: **you**  - refers to the //Addressee//
In Standard English, **you**  is also used to refer to many different //Addressees//. Therefore, the //Singularity //  vs. //Plurality //  of **you**  is based on context.

Many languages have one gender-neutral //3rd Person Singular Pronoun//, however, English has two, depending on the sex of the individual referenced.

  * //3rd Person Singular Personal Masculine Pronoun: //**he **- refers to a male person
  * //3rd Person Singular Personal Feminine Pronoun: //**she **- refers to a female person
English has a gender-neutral //3rd Person Singular Pronoun//, however, it can only refer to inanimate (non-living) objects.

  * //3rd Person Singular Inanimate Pronoun//: **it**  - refers to a singular thing
Therefore, if you want to remain gender-neutral in referencing a single person, you must use the phrase "he or she".

Often times, however, "they" is used in place of a singular gender-neutral pronoun as opposed to the phrase "he or she".

"If __a student__  wants to get a good grade on the test, then __he or she__  must study hard."

"If __a student__  wants to get a good grade on the test, then __they__  must study hard."

**//Singular Demonstrative Pronouns//  **

  * **this**
  * **that**
**//Singular Indefinite Pronouns//  **

**//Singular Relative Pronouns//  **

//Relative//  Pronouns are used at the beginning of clauses.

  * **who/whom**  - refers only to a person or people
  * **that**
  * **which**
Both **who/whom**  and **that**  are often used interchangeably, however, as **who/whom**  can only refer to people, use of **who/whom**  over **that**  in reference to people can imply humanization.

"our messiah __that__  came to save us" (Jesus the son of God)

"our messiah __who__  came to save us" (Jesus the son of man)

**//Singular Possessive Pronouns//  **

  * **my/mine**
  * **your/yours**
  * **his**
  * **her/hers**
  * **its**
If you want to remain gender-neutral in referencing a single person, you must use the phrase "his or her(s)".

**//Singular Reflexive Pronouns//  **

  * **myself**
  * **yourself**
  * **herself**
  * **himself**
  * **itself**
