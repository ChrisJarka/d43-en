===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: Parallelism)

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

  * **For their vine comes from the vine of Sodom **- This metaphor compares the people of Israel's enemies to grape vines to show that their fruits or actions were as bad as the fruits or actions of Sodom and Gomorrah. AT: "For their grapevines come from the vineyards of Sodom" (See: Metaphor)
  * **cluster**  - This means a group of things that are close together. Refers to the grape clusters.
