\c 4
\p
\v 1 But the Spirit says expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits
and doctrines of demons,
\v 2 through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;
\v 3 forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by
them that believe and know the truth.
\v 4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:
\v 5 for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
\p
\v 6 If you put the brethren in mind of these things, you shall be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of
the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed until
now:
\v 7 but refuse profane and old wivesâ€™ fables. And exercise yourself to godliness:
\v 8 for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life
which now is, and of that which is to come.
\v 9 Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation.
\v 10 For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men,
specially of them that believe.
\v 11 These things command and teach.
\v 12 Let no man despise your youth; but be you an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in
faith, in purity.
\v 13 Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
\v 14 Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the
presbytery.
\v 15 Be diligent in these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your progress may be manifest to all.
\v 16 Take heed to yourself, and to your teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this you shall save both yourself and
them that hear thee.
