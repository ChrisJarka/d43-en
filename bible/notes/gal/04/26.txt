\v 26 But there will be a new Jerusalem in heaven, and we who will go there are free from having to obey Jewish laws. We who belong to that city consider it to be our mother city because we are God's true children.
\v 27 Our new city will have more people than those who live in Jerusalem now. It will be just like Isaiah foretold about the people whom he expected would come back to Jerusalem from exile. He expected that they would be more numerous than those who were taken into exile. He wrote:
\q You who live in Jerusalem, you will rejoice! Now you have no children, like a barren woman who does not give birth to children! But some day you will shout with joy, without restraint, even though now you are few, like a woman who cannot give birth to children, and you feel deserted. You will be very happy because you will have many children who will come to you. Those children will be more than the children any woman with a husband could have borne.

\v 26 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, that is our mother.
\v 27 For it is written,
\q "Rejoice, you barren woman who does not bear,
\q Break out and shout, you who does not travail,
\q For more are the children of the desolate than her who has a husband."
