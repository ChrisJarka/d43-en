\v 10 Then Moses said to Yahweh, "Oh Lord, I have never been good at speaking to people. I am still that way, even after you began talking to me. I speak slowly and never know what to say."
\v 11 Then Yahweh said to him, "Who made a man's mouth? Who is it who makes a man able to speak, hear, see, or not see? Is it not I, Yahweh?
\v 12 So now go, and I will help you speak, and I will tell you what to say."
\v 13 But Moses replied, "Oh Lord, I ask you, please send someone else in my place!"

\v 10 Then Moses said to Yahweh , "Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, nor was I ever so, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."
\v 11 Yahweh said to him, "Who has made manâ€™s mouth? Or who makes a man mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh ?
\v 12 So now go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what to say."
