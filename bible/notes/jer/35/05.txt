====== Jeremiah 35:5-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 I set jugs of wine in front of them and urged them to drink some,
\v 6 but they refused. They said, "We do not drink wine, because our ancestor Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, commanded us, saying 'You and your descendants must never drink wine.
\v 7 And you must not build houses or plant vineyards or other crops. Instead, you must always live in tents. If you obey those commands, you all will live for many years in this land.'

<usfm>
\v 5 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, Drink you wine.
\v 6 But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, You shall drink no
wine, neither ye, nor your sons, for ever:
\v 7 neither shall you build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents;
that you may live many days in the land wherein you sojourn.
</usfm>
