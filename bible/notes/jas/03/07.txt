<usfm>
\v 7 Indeed, although people are able to tame all kinds of wild animals, birds, reptiles and creatures that live in the water, and people have tamed them,
\v 8 no person on his own is able to control what he says. And when people speak evilly, it shows that they do evil things without controling themselves. As the poison of a snake kills people, we can harm others by what we say.

\v 7 Every kind of wild animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind,
\v 8 but no one among man is able to tame the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

(See [[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]] and [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **reptile **- This is an animal that crawls on the ground. (See: Translating Unknowns)
  * **sea creature**  - This is an animal that lives in water. (See: Translating Unknowns)
