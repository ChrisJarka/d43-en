===== Finishing Checking =====

//This page answers the question:// //How do I know when I have finished the checking for each level?//

//In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read://

It can be difficult to know when you have sufficiently checked a text for errors or for ways that it could be improved. In a sense, this process is never completely finished, and people continually find ways to improve texts that have been checked already by many people. For example, there are many Bible translations in English that have been checked by many biblical scholars and are considered to be excellent translations. Yet it is possible to find places where they could be made better, and over time, they are continually revised and new versions are published. This is the process that you should expect to happen with these Bible translations, as well.

==== Checking Evaluation Lists ====

The following lists can help you to consider whether or not you have checked a GL resource sufficiently and are ready to submit it for publishing at the different levels.

=== Level One ===

In order to be ready for publishing at level one, I have completed:
  * Initial study of the related materials, including: 
    * The guidelines for translation of the Works in the Gateway Languages Manual 
    * The translationNotes 
    * The definitions of translationWords
    * Reading each chapter connected to the Works in both ULB and UDB
  * Careful comparison with the source text, including:
    * Individual self edit
    * Peer edit
    * Key word check as a team
    * Accuracy check as a team
  * Final editing, including everything learned from the earlier editing sessions, the translationNotes, and the definitions of translationWords

=== Level Two ===

In addition to the steps listed above for level one, the resource has been checked by at least 2 people who are mother-tongue speakers of the target language, bilingual in English, and who were not involved in translating the resource. These people can attest:

  * The Translation conforms to the Statement of Faith (see https://unfoldingword.org/faith ) and Translation Guidelines (see https://unfoldingword.org/guidelines ).
  * The Translation accurately communicates the content of the source document in the target language.
  * The style of the Translation conforms to the guidelines set forth for translation of this resource in the Gateway Languages Manual.
  * The translation team has edited the Translation to my satisfaction.

=== Level Three ===

For level three, at least 2 more people need to have checked the resource who were not involved in the translation, were not part of the checking process of level two for that resource, and are bilingual in English. In addition, these people should be Bible scholars. They also need to affirm the same statements as in level two.

Additional questions that can help you to evaluate if the translation has been sufficiently checked are in [[en:ta:vol1:checking:self_assessment]]. Just be aware that the ULB and the UDB are not intended to be completely natural in the Gateway Language.
