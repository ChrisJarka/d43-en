\v 6 And so it was, when God commanded the man dressed in linen and said, "Take fire from between the wheels that are between
the cherubim;" that the man went in and stood beside a wheel.
\v 7 And the cherub reached out his hand between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and lifted it up and placed
it into the hands of the one dressed in linen. He took it and went back out.
\v 8 I saw on the cherubim something like a manâ€™s hand under their wings.
