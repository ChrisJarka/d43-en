\v 3 The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rock, in your lofty home; who say in your heart, "Who will bring me down to the ground?"
\v 4 Though you soar high like the eagle and though your nest is set among the stars, I will bring you down from there, says Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Obadiah's vision concerning Edom continues.

  * **The pride of your heart has deceived you** - The "heart" was associated with emotions. The Edomites' pride caused them to be deceived about their security. AT: "Your pride has deceived you" or "Your pride causes you think you are safe"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in the clefts of the rock** - "in the cracks in the rock." This here has the sense of a place that is protected because it is surrounded by rocks.
  * **in your lofty home** - "in your home that was built in a high place"
  * **say in your heart** - Here "in your heart" is an idiom that means "to yourself." AT: "say to yourselves" or "think" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Who will bring me down to the ground?** - This question expresses that the Edomites were proud and felt safe. AT: "No one can bring me down to the ground." or "I am safe from all attackers." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Though you soar high like the eagle and though your nest is set among the stars** - Both of these phrases are saying Edom is built much higher than possible, to say it was built in a very high place. AT: "And I tell you that even if you had wings and could fly higher than eagles fly, and if you could make your homes among the stars" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I will bring you down from there** - Pride is associated with height and humility is associated with being low. Yahweh says he will bring Edom down to say he will humble it. AT: "I will humble you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
