~~DISCUSSION~~{{tag>check}}

**Manager: T**his aspect of the sacrifice is hard to explain because the priest did not sprinkle the blood on top of the lid since that is where the presence of the Shekinah Glory was, rather he put the blood on the face board of the lid and then on the lower face of the box, both as it happens faced east. This understanding does not come clear no matter how it is worded……just my thoughts.
