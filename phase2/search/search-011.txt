====== Search 011: "See how you ..." following AT statement ======

~~NOCACHE~~

There are multiple occurrences of one of the two statements below following an AT:

  * "See how you translated this in ..."
  * "Translate this ..."

Both of these instances result in adding invalid final punctuation to the AT statement. The note linking to a previous text should be moved before the AT statement, and the punctuation removed from the AT (except when referring to an RQ).
