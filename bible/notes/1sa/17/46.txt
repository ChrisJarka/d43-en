\v 46 This day will Jehovah deliver you into my hand; and I will strike you, and take your head from off you; and I will give
the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth;
that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
\v 47 and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saves not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovahâ€™s, and he
will give you into our hand.
