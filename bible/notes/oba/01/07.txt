\v 7 All the men of your confederacy have brought you on your way, even to the border: the men that were at peace with you have
deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat your bread lay a snare under thee: there is no understanding
in him.
\v 8 Shall I not in that day, says Jehovah, destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
\v 9 And your mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by
slaughter.
