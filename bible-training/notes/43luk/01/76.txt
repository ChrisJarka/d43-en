===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **you, child**  - This a form of direct address. It may be more natural to say "you, my child," especially since Zacharias is prophesying about his infant son John.
    * **will be called a**** prophet **- This means he actually will be a prophet and people will know him as such. It does not mean that he will just be called that. To make that clear, this could be translated as "will be a prophet." //[the second sentence of this note could be deleted]//
    * **of the Most High**  - That is, "who serves the Most High God" or "who speaks for the Most High God."
    * **before the face of the Lord**- That is, "in the presence of the Lord."
    * **to prepare his ways**  - That is, "to prepare people for his coming" or "get people ready to meet him."
    * **to give knowledge of salvation**  - That is, "to teach people about how God will save them."
    * **by the forgiveness of their sins**  - That is, "through forgiving them their sins."
