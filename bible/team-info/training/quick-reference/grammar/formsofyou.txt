====== Forms of 'You' ======


===== Description =====

Some languages have more than one word for ‘you’ depending on how many people are being spoken to. If they are speaking to one person, they use the ‘singular’ form of ‘you’. If they are speaking to more than one person, they use the ‘plural’ form of ‘you.’ Some languages have a ‘dual’ form for speaking to two people and some have other forms for speaking to three or four people.
