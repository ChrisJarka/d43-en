\v 4 You have not yet resisted to blood, struggling against sin.
\v 5 And you have forgotten the encouragement which instrcts you as sons,
\q "My son, do not lightly regard the chastening of the Lord,
\q Nor faint when you are disciplined by him;"
\q
\v 6 For whom the Lord loves he disciplines,
\q And  he punishes every son whom he receives.

===== Translation Notes: =====


The author of Hebrews has been comparing the Christian life to a race.

    * **not yet resisted to blood** - This is said in a negative way to emphasize their persecution is slight. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]]) 
    * **resisted to blood** - "resisted to death." This phrase means a person does what is right even if he were killed because of it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **the encouragement which instructs you** - the encouraging writings of Solomon in the Old Testament, which help a person understand how to be encouraged during times of discipline by the Lord (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **as sons** - “as sons of God” (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **do not lightly regard** - AT: "respect." This is said in a negative way to emphasize it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
    * **the chastening of the Lord** - "when the Lord criticizes you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **faint** - AT: "lose all strength" or "become discouraged" or "quit"
    * **the Lord disciplines anyone whom he loves, and he punishes every son whom he receives** - AT: "anyone the Lord receives as a son, he loves and will discipline." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) Both phrases mean basically the same thing.
