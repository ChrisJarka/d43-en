\c 26
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity:
\q I have trusted also in Jehovah without wavering.
\q
\v 2 Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me;
\q Try my heart and my mind.
\q
\v 3 For your lovingkindness is before mine eyes;
\q And I have walked in your truth.
\q
\v 4 I have not sat with men of falsehood;
\q Neither will I go in with dissemblers.
\q
\v 5 I hate the assembly of evil-doers,
\q And will not sit with the wicked.
\q
\v 6 I will wash my hands in innocency:
\q So will I compass your altar, O Jehovah;
\q
\v 7 That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard,
\q And tell of all your wondrous works.
\q
\v 8 Jehovah, I love the habitation of your house,
\q And the place where your glory dwelleth.
\q
\v 9 Gather not my soul with sinners,
\q Nor my life with men of blood;
\q
\v 10 In whose hands is wickedness,
\q And their right hand is full of bribes.
\q
\v 11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity:
\q Redeem me, and be merciful to me.
\q
\v 12 My foot stands in an even place:
\q In the congregations will I bless Jehovah.
