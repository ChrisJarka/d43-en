\v 18 So they and the other people stopped worshiping at the temple, and they started worshiping the poles dedicated to \add the goddess\add* Asherah and other idols. Because of their doing those sinful things, God was very angry with the people of Jerusalem and \add with the people in other places in\add* Judah.
\v 19 Although Yahweh sent prophets to persuade them to return to him, and although the prophets testified about the \add evil things that they had done\add*, the people would not pay attention.

\v 17 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to
them.
\v 18 And they forsook the house of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols: and wrath came
upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.
\v 19 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to Jehovah; and they testified against them: but they would not give
ear.
