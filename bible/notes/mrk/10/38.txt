\v 38 But Jesus said to them, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the
baptism that I am baptized with?
\v 39 And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, The cup that I drink you shall drink; and with the baptism
that I am baptized withal shall you be baptized:
\v 40 but to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give; but
it is for them for whom it has been prepared.
