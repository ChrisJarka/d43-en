\d Maschil of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 O God, why have you cast us off for ever?
\q Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?
\q
\v 2 Remember your congregation, which you have gotten of old,
\q Which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance;
\q And mount Zion, wherein you have dwelt.
\q
\v 3 Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins,
\q All the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.
\q
\v 4 Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly;
\q They have set up their ensigns for signs.
\q
\v 5 They seemed as men that lifted up
\q Axes upon a thicket of trees.
\q
\v 6 And now all the carved work thereof
\q They break down with hatchet and hammers.
\q
\v 7 They have set your sanctuary on fire;
\q They have profaned the dwelling-place of your name by casting it
to the ground.
\q
\v 8 They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether:
\q They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
\q
\v 9 We see not our signs:
\q There is no more any prophet;
\q Neither is there among us any that knows how long.
\q
\v 10 How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach?
\q Shall the enemy blaspheme your name for ever?
\q
\v 11 Why drawest you back your hand, even your right hand?
\q Pluck it out of your bosom and consume them.
\b
\q
\v 12 Yet God is my King of old,
\q Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
\q
\v 13 You did divide the sea by your strength:
\q You brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.
\q
\v 14 You brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces;
\q You gave him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
\q
\v 15 You did cleave fountain and flood:
\q You dried up mighty rivers.
\q
\v 16 The day is thine, the night also is thine:
\q You have prepared the light and the sun.
\q
\v 17 You have set all the borders of the earth:
\q You have made summer and winter.
\q
\v 18 Remember this, that the enemy has reproached, O Jehovah,
\q And that a foolish people has blasphemed your name.
\q
\v 19 Oh deliver not the soul of your turtle-dove to the wild beast:
\q Forget not the life of your poor for ever.
\q
\v 20 Have respect to the covenant;
\q For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.
\q
\v 21 Oh let not the oppressed return ashamed:
\q Let the poor and needy praise your name.
\q
\v 22 Arise, O God, plead your own cause:
\q Remember how the foolish man reproaches you all the day.
\q
\v 23 Forget not the voice of your adversaries:
\q The tumult of those that rise up against you ascendeth continually.
