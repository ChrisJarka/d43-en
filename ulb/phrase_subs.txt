Great art Lord God/Great are you Lord God
How happeneth it/How is it
Thinkest you not/Do you not think
Wherefore weepest thou/Why do you weep
Thou wast/You were
art waxen old/have become old
come hither/come here
took to wife/married
Thus saith the LORD/This is what Yahweh says
Doest not/Do not do
thy dwelling-place/the place where you live
