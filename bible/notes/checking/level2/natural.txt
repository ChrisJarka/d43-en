====== Natural Language ======

These are questions you can ask to see if the flow of the language of the translation sounds natural for your language group:

Q? Is there a good flow to the language when the passages are read out loud? (Does the language sound like the writer was a person from your own community?)

Q? Does the writer use words well? (Are the people and places of the story described using expressions commonly heard in your community?)

Q? Is this the way people talk in your area? (Does the speaker sound strange or perhaps like someone from outside your community?)
