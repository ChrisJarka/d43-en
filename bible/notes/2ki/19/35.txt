fourscore and five thousand: and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
\v 36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh.
\v 37 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with
the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.
