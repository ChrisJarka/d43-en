\v 1  \add Now I will say this to those among\add* you who are elders in the congregations: I also am an elder. I am one  \add of those\add* who saw Christ when he suffered, and I am also one who will share some of the glory\f + \ft Or: greatness \f* that Christ has in heaven.
\v 2  \add I appeal to you elders\add* to take care of the people who are in your  \add congregations\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* as shepherds  \add take care of their\add* flocks of sheep. Do this, not because you must do it, but instead do it willingly, as God desires. Do not be greedy to get a lot  \add of money for doing it\add*, but instead do it enthusiastically\f + \ft Or: wholeheartedly \f*.
\v 3 Do not act like domineering  \add bosses over\add* the people \f + \ft metaphor \f* whom God has assigned\f + \ft Or: entrusted \f* to you, but instead be examples to them by the way in which you conduct your lives.
\v 4  \add If you do that\add*, when Jesus, who is  \add like\add* our chief shepherd \f + \ft metaphor \f*, appears, he will give each of you a  \add glorious\f + \ft Or: wonderful \f* reward\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add That reward will be like\add* the wreaths  \add that are given to victorious athletes\add*, but your reward will never wither  \add like wreaths do\add*.

\v 1 The elders therefore among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
\v 2 Tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to the will of God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
\v 3 neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock.
\v 4 And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, you shall receive the crown of glory that fades not away.
