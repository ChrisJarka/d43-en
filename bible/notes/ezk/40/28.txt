===== Important Terms: =====

  * courtyard
  * gate
  * doorposts
  * cubits (see: Biblical distances page)

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **niches**  - This refers to small rooms.
  * **according to these measures**  - alternate translation: delete this as it is redundant.  The inner courtyard wall was like the outer courtyard wall in that it contained small rooms within it. These rooms faced the outer courtyard and had porches with windows outside the doors.
