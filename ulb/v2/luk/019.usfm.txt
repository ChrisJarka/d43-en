\v 1 And he entered and was passing through Jericho.
\v 2 And behold, a man called by name Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich.
\v 3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature.
\v 4 And he ran on before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.
\v 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for today I must
abide at your house.
\v 6 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
\v 7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner.
\v 8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have
wrongfully exacted anything of any man, I restore fourfold.
\v 9 And Jesus said to him, To-day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.
\v 10 For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.
\p
\v 11 And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and
because they supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear.
\v 12 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
\v 13 And he called ten servants of his, and gave them ten pounds, and said to them, Trade you
herewith till I come.
\v 14 But his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassage after him, saying, We will not that this man reign over us.
\v 15 And it came to pass, when he was come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, to
whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading.
\v 16 And the first came before him, saying, Lord, your pound has made ten pounds more.
\v 17 And he said to him, Well done, you good servant: because you was found faithful in a very little, have you
authority over ten cities.
\v 18 And the second came, saying, Your pound, Lord, has made five pounds.
\v 19 And he said to him also, Be you also over five cities.
\v 20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is your pound, which I kept laid up in a napkin:
\v 21 for I feared thee, because you are an austere man: you take up that which you layedst not down, and reap that
which you did not sow.
\v 22 He says to him, Out of your own mouth will I judge thee, you wicked servant. You knew that I am an austere man,
taking up that which I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow;
\v 23 then wherefore gave you not my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have required it with interest?
\v 24 And he said to them that stood by, Take away from him the pound, and give it to him that has the ten pounds.
\v 25 And they said to him, Lord, he has ten pounds.
\v 26 I say to you, that to every one that has shall be given; but from him that has not, even that which he has shall
be taken away from him.
\v 27 But these mine enemies, that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and kill them before me.
\p
\v 28 And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 29 And it came to pass, when he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the
disciples,
\v 30 saying, Go your way into the village over against you; in which as you enter you shall find a colt tied, whereon
no man ever yet sat: loose him, and bring him.
\v 31 And if any one ask you, Why do you loose him? thus shall you say, The Lord has need of him.
\v 32 And they that were sent went away, and found even as he had said to them.
\v 33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them, Why loose you the colt?
\v 34 And they said, The Lord has need of him.
\v 35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon.
\v 36 And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.
\v 37 And as he was now drawing nigh, even at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the
disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen;
\v 38 saying, Blessed is the King that comes in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
\v 39 And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples.
\v 40 And he answered and said, I tell you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.
\p
\v 41 And when he drew nigh, he saw the city and wept over it,
\v 42 saying, If you had known in this day, even you, the things which belong to peace! but now they are hid from your
eyes.
\v 43 For the days shall come upon you, when your enemies shall cast up a bank about you, and compass you round, and keep
you in on every side,
\v 44 and shall dash you to the ground, and your children within you; and they shall not leave in you one stone upon another;
because you knew not the time of your visitation.
\p
\v 45 And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold,
\v 46 saying to them, It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayour: but you have made it a den of robbers.
\p
\v 47 And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought
to destroy him:
\v 48 and they could not find what they might do; for the people all hung upon him, listening.
