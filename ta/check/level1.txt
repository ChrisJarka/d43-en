===== Checking Level One â€“ Internal Check =====

==== Definition of Checking Level One ====

<font 14px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Level One checking will be done primarily by the translation team, with some help from others in the language community. The translator or translation team should check their translation before they translate very many stories or chapters of the Bible, so that they can correct mistakes as early as possible in the translation process. Many of the steps in this process will need to be done several times before the translation is finished.</font>

  * For the purposes of the unfoldingWord project, translations of Bible texts are only published once they achieve Level Two. Other biblical content is made available at Level One.
  * This enables the broadest reach of the content as an active project, with an open invitation (implied or direct) to help improve the translation.

==== Steps for checking under Level One (Internal): ====

These are the steps that the translation team must follow in order to achieve Checking Level One.

  - The translator (or team) makes contact with at least one element of the unfoldingWord network, notifying unfoldingWord that they intend to begin translation. One way to do that is by clicking [here].
  - Review the [[:en:statement-of-faith|Statement of Faith]] and the [[:en:translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines]].
  - The translator (or team) asserts that the Statement of Faith is an accurate reflection of their own beliefs and that they intend to translate the content in harmony with it [here].
  - The translator (or team) asserts that they intend to translate the content in accordance with the Translation Guidelines [here].
  - Draft some portions of the text[[:en:ta:check:1|[1]]] For instructions on how to make a draft translation, click [[:en:ta:check:draft|here.]]
  - Self Check. For instructions on how to do a self-check of your draft translation, click __[[:en:ta:check:selfcheck|here.]]__
  - Peer Check
  - Give your translation to a member of the translation team who did not work on this passage. Have that person go through all of the steps of number 4, making note of any places that need fixing.
  - Review the translation together and fix those places.
  - Read the revised translation out loud to this person and fix anything that does not sound like it is the way that someone from your community would say it.
  - Important Term Check
  - Make a list of the Important Terms in the story or Bible passage that you translate, along with the term that you choose for it in the target language.[[:en:ta:check:2|[2]]]
  - Each time the Important Term occurs in the source text, make sure that the word you have chosen for the translation still makes sense in that context. If it does not, discuss the problem with others on the translation team and try to find a solution together. You may need to use a different term, or you may need to use more than one term for the different contexts, or you may need to find another way to communicate the Important Term, such as using a longer phrase.
  - Accuracy Check

The people who do the Level One accuracy check can be members of the translation team, but they should __not__  be the same people who translated the story or Bible passage that they are checking. They can also be members of the community who are not part of the translation team. They should be speakers of the language of the translation, be respected in the community, and, if possible, know the Bible well in the language of wider communication. The purpose of this step is to make sure that the translation accurately communicates the meaning of the original story or Bible passage. The checkers will be helping the translation team think about the best way to translate the meaning of the story or Bible passage in their own language. There can be one person who checks a story or Bible passage, or more than one. Having more than one person checking a story or passage can be helpful, because often different checkers will notice different things. The people doing the checking should follow these steps:

  -

Each of the checkers should read the translation (or listen to the recording) by himself, comparing it to the original Bible passage or story in the language of wider communication. As the checker reads (or listens to) the translation and compares it to the original, he should keep in mind these general questions:

  - Does the translation add anything to the original meaning?
  - Is there any part of the meaning that is left out of the translation?
  - Has the translation changed the meaning in any way?

In addition to these general questions, the checker should consider the questions for specific Bible passages that are being developed. [link]

  - The checker should make notes where he thinks there might be a problem or something to be improved.
  - After the checkers have done this individually, they should all meet with the translator or translation team and review the story or Bible passage together. As they come to the places where each checker made note of a problem or question, the checkers can ask their questions or make suggestions for improvement. As the checkers and the translation team discuss the questions and suggestions, they might think of other questions or new ways of saying things. This is good. As the checkers and the translation team work together, God will help them discover the best way to communicate the meaning of the stories.
  - After the checkers and the translation team have decided what they need to change, the translation team will revise the translation.
  - After the translation team revises the translation, they should read it out loud to each other or to other members of the language community to make sure that it still sounds natural in their language.
  - The translator (or team) makes a note of any Bible passages that are still difficult to understand, and where they would like additional consultant help. These notes will be used by the church leaders and checkers in levels 2 and 3, so that they can help the translators understand the meaning and communicate it more clearly.
  - The translator (or team) affirms that they have made full use of the Translation Notes, the Important Terms, and the other exegetical and translation checking resources in the translation process, and that they have followed the steps for checking under Level One.

[[:en:ta:check:1|[1]]] [We will need to provide a recommended drafting process, unless that is done face-to-face, such as in a MAST program. Part of this drafting process can bring in issues of orthography and spelling decisions, and formatting issues such as section headings, footnotes, verse numbering, proper names, direct quotes and OT quotations, etc.]

[[:en:ta:check:2|[2]]] [We should have a place for them to keep a master list on Door43, so the list will be easy to manage and they can avoid duplicating words and lists of words. Or do we already have a master list on Door43? Can we also have a way for them to do a search on the words in order to do a consistency check?]
