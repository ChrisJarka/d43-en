====== Micah 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Micah is written mainly in a poetic form. Most of the prophets wrote to either the Northern Kingdom or the Southern Kingdom. Micah wrote to both of them at times as he did in this chapter.

== City Names ==

Micah uses many place names in this chapter. Some of the places are more obvious like Judah and Israel or Samaria and Jerusalem. But there are a number places mentioned that are fairly obscure and unknown. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
This passage sounds unusual because of its construction in Hebrew, called a play on words. The names of the cities are used to describe their destruction. "Lachish will be lashed" is an example of this type of construction. This is a poetic element that might not correspond to the actual way they will be punished.
