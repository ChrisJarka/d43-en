\v 12 It was not the ideas that unbelievers teach that we accepted. Instead, it was the Spirit who came from God that we received, in order that we might know the things that God has freely done for us.
\v 13 Those are the things that I tell you about. As I do that, I do not tell you things that someone  \add whom others thought\add* was \f + \ft irony \f* wise taught me. Instead, I tell you truths that  \add God's\add* Spirit taught  \add me\add*, and I explain those spiritual truths to people whose thinking is guided by God's Spirit \f + \ft Or: I teach spiritual  \add truths to\add* spiritual \add people\add* \f*.

\v 12 The Spirit that God gave us is not a spirit that comes from this world. We received the Spirit which comes from God. That Spirit helps us understand all the gifts God freely gives us.
\v 13 We teach these lessons, the lessons God gave us, in words that even the wisdom of men cannot explain. These lessons are taught only by the Spirit of God and he takes the meaning of spiritual ideas and helps us understand them by his spiritual wisdom.

\v 13 We speak about these things in words which manâ€™s wisdom cannot teach, but which the Spirit teaches us, the Spirit  interpreting spiritual words with spiritual wisdom.
