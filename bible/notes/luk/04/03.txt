===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **If you are the Son of God **- That is, "if you are really the Son of God." The Greek text words this phrase, “If you are the Son of God” or “If a Son you are of God.” This emphasizes the word “Son” and could be translated as “If God really fathered you.” This was a challenge meaning "assuming you are indeed the Son of God, show it to me" or "you claim that you are the Son of God, do this." Others see the phrase as a recognition, such as "since you are the Son of God."
    * **command this stone to become bread**  - This literally means "speak to this stone so that it might become bread" and could be translated as "tell this stone to become bread." The devil was either holding the stone in his hand or pointing to a nearby stone.
    * **It is written**  - Rather, "it has been written." This implies authority and truthfulness, such as "it is written in the Scriptures" or "it is written in the authoritative Scriptures."
    * **Man will not live on bread alone**  - This means, "A human being will not live on just bread." It could be translated as, "It is not just bread that makes a person live." 
    * **bread** - In this sentence, "bread" is used to refer to food in general. If people would think this sentence means that bread is not the only food that people need to eat, "bread" could also be translated as "food." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:synecdoche|Synecdoche]]).
