\v 2-5 When David had been king, he arranged for a new sacred tent to be made in Jerusalem. Then David and the Israelite leaders brought God's sacred chest from the city of Kiriath Jearim to the new sacred tent. But when Solomon became the king, the first sacred tent was still in the city of Gibeon. There was a bronze altar there that Bezalel son of Uri and grandson of Hur, had made was also still at Gibeon, in front of the first sacred tent.
\p Solomon called together the army commanders of one thousand soldiers and the commanders of one hundred soldiers, with the judges and all the other leaders in Israel. He told them to go with him to Gibeon. So they all went to the place on the hill where idols were worshiped at Gibeon. That was the same place where God had met with his people in the tent which Moses had made. There Solomon and all the others with him prayed to Yahweh.

\v 2 Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' houses.
\v 3 So Solomon and all the assembly with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh, had made in the wilderness.
\v 4 But David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place that he had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
\v 5 In addition, the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh; Solomon and the assembly went to it.
\f + \ft Some older versions have, \fqa the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, he placed there before the tabernacle of Yahweh \fqa* , where \fqa he \fqa* refers to David. \f*

  * **spoke to all Israel, to the commanders ... heads of the fathers' house** - Here "all of Israel" means those people mentioned afterwards. They represent all of Israel. AT: "spoke to the commanders ... heads of the father's house"
  * **the commanders of thousands** - These are military leaders who commanded more than 1,000 men but less than 10,000 men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **and of hundreds** - These are military leaders who commanded more than 100 men but less than 1,000 men. AT: "and to the commanders of hundreds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
