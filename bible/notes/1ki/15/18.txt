\v 19 "I want there to be a peace treaty between me and you, like there was between my father and your father. For that purpose, I am giving you this silver and gold. So now please cancel the treaty that you made with Baasha, the king of Israel, in order that he will take his soldiers away from attacking mine, \add because he will be afraid of your army\add*."

\v 18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of
the kingâ€™s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon,
the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that lived at Damascus, saying,
\v 19 There is a league between me and you, between my father and your father: behold, I have sent to you a
