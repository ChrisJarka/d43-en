\v 32 And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going ahead of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took aside the Twelve and began to tell them what was about to happen to him.
\v 33 He told them, "See, we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles,
\v 34 and they will mock him and spit upon him, and they will scourge him and kill him; and after three days he shall rise again.
