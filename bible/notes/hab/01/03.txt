<usfm>
\q
\v 3 Why do you make me see iniquity and look upon wrongdoing? 
\q Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and contention rises up!
\q
\v 4 Therefore the law is weakened, and justice does not last for any time. 
\q For the wicked surround the righteous; therefore false justice goes forth."

===== Translation Notes: =====
Habakkuk continues his prayer to God.

    * **contention rises up** - "fighting among the people is becoming more common" 
    * **wicked surround the righteous** - The word "surround" is used to show there are more wicked people than righteous and this gives them more power.  Alternate Translation: "the wicked use having more people to control the righteous" (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
