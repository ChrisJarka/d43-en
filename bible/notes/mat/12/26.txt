===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 26 In the same way, if Satan were driving out his own demons, he would be fighting against himself. His kingdom would not continue! \v 27 Furthermore, if it is true that Satan enables me to drive out demons, is it also true that your disciples who drive them out do so by Satan's power? No! So they will show you that you are not thinking logically. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 26 If Satan throws out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand? \v 27 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons drive them out? Therefore they will be your judges. </usfm>
