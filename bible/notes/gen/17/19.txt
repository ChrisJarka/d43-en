\v 19 God said, "Truly Sarah your wife is about to bear you a son, and you must name him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
\v 20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I hereby bless him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him abundantly. He will be the father of twelve leaders of tribes, and I will make him become a great nation.
\v 21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time in the next year."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you must name him **- The "you" is masculine singular and refers to Abraham.
  * **leaders of tribes**  - "chiefs" or "rulers"
  * **Behold**  - The word "behold" here draws attention to the action that comes next.
  * **but my covenantâ€¦**  - The phrase "covenant" is placed at the beginning of the sentence to draw attention to it. If your language uses word order to draw attention to phrases, you should do that here (see [[:en:ta:vocabulary:wordorder|Word Order]]).
  * **Truly Sarah...will bear**  - This is intended to contrast Abraham's wrong belief that the covenant would be with Ishmael with God's promise that the covenant would come through Isaac.
  * **bold words**  - explanation
