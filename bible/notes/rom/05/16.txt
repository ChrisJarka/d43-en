\v 16 And \add there is another way in which God's\add* freely \add erasing the record of our sins\add* is not like \add the results of Adam's\add* sinning. One person, \add Adam, sinned\add*. As a result, God declared that all people deserve to be punished. Many people sinned. But what God did was that he erased the record of their sins without their earning it.
\v 17 All people die \f + \ft metaphor, personification \f* because of what one man, \add Adam\add*, did. But now many of us experience that God has abundantly acted towards us in ways we did not deserve, and we experience that he has erased the record of our sins without our earning it. It is also very certain that we will rule \add with Christ\add* \f + \ft Or: share \add the glory\add* of Christ's being king \f*, \add in heaven. This will happen\add* because of \add what\add* one man, Jesus Christ, \add did for us\add*.

\v 16 For the gift is not as through one who sinned. For the judgment came on the one hand from the trespass of one to condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift came because of many trespasses resulting in justification.
\v 17 For if, by the trespass of one, death ruled through the one, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness rule in life through the one, Jesus Christ.
