===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 \add One day I said this to Yahweh\add*:
\q1 "Yahweh, \add when you chose me to be a prophet\add*, you deceived me, and I allowed you to deceive me.
\q2 You insisted that I \add become a prophet\add* because you are stronger than I am.
\q1 And now everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* ridicules me.
\q2 They make fun of me all the day.
\q1
\v 8 When I tell \add people your messages\add*, I shout saying,
\q2 '\add Yahweh is going to cause you to experience\add* violence and destruction!'
\q1 So because I tell them those messages from you,
\q2 they insult me and scoff at me all the day.
\q1
\v 9 But if I would say, 'I will never mention Yahweh or say anything about him, \f + \ft metonymy \f*'
\q2 \add it would be as though\add* your message would burn in my inner being like \f + \ft simile \f* a fire;
\q2 it would be like a fire in my bones.
\q1 Sometimes I try to remain silent and not proclaim your messages,
\q2 but I am not able to do that.

\p
\v 7 O Jehovah, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am become a
laughing stock all the day, every one mocketh me.
\v 8 For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of Jehovah is made a reproach to
me, and a derision, all the day.
\v 9 And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a
burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot
contain.
