\c 140
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Deliver me, O Jehovah, from the evil man;
\q Preserve me from the violent man:
\q
\v 2 Who devise mischiefs in their heart;
\q Continually do they gather themselves together for war.
\q
\v 3 They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent;
\q Addersâ€™ poison is under their lips. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked;
\q Preserve me from the violent man:
\q Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps.
\q
\v 5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords;
\q They have spread a net by the wayside;
\q They have set gins for me. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 I said to Jehovah, You are my God:
\q Give ear to the voice of my supplications, O Jehovah.
\q
\v 7 O Jehovah the Lord, the strength of my salvation,
\q You have covered my head in the day of battle.
\q
\v 8 Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked;
\q Further not his evil device, lest they exalt themselves.
\qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 9 As for the head of those that compass me about,
\q Let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
\q
\v 10 Let burning coals fall upon them:
\q Let them be cast into the fire,
\q Into deep pits, whence they shall not rise.
\q
\v 11 An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth:
\q Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
\q
\v 12 I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
\q And justice for the needy.
\q
\v 13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks to your name:
\q The upright shall dwell in your presence.
