===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The gloom will be dispelled from her who is in anguish** - The word "her" refers to the people of Israel. As in 9:21-22, Isaiah compares the people's suffering to living in the dark. Here Isaiah emphasizes that in the future Yahweh will bring them out of the dark. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will remove the darkness from the people of Israel who were in intense pain." (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metaphor]] and [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:active]])   
  * **The gloom** - This word means "partial or total darkness." See how you translated "gloom" in [[en:bible:notes:isa:08:21|08:22]].  
  * **In an earlier time he humiliated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali** - This refers to the people of Zebulun and the people of Naphtali. Earlier God had allowed the army of Assyria to conquer them. Alternate translation: "In the past, the Lord humbled those living in Zebulun and Naphtali."  (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metonymy]])
  * **but in the later time he will make it glorious, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations** - "But in the future, the Lord will honor the people of Galilee, from the way to the Mediterranean sea to the Jordan River where many people from other nations live." 
  * **The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who have lived in the land of the shadow of death, the light has shone on them.** - Both of these sentences say the same thing for emphasis. Isaiah again compares the people's suffering to a land of darkness, shadow, and death.  He compares Yahweh coming to save them to great light shining on them. Also, often in prophecy things that will happen in the future are described as happening in the past. This emphasizes that these things will certainly happen.  Alternate translation: "The people who had lived in the land of darkness and death will see a bright light.(See [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]]).
