====== 1 Corinthians 13:8-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 We should never \f + \ft personification \f* let anything stop us from continuing to love  \add others\add*. As for the ability to speak messages that come directly from God, some day that will come to an end. As for the ability to speak languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that we have not learned\add*, that will  \add also\add* come to an end some day. And as for the ability to know things that God reveals to us, that will come to an end some day  \add because it will not be necessary anymore\add*.
\v 9 God does not reveal everything to us, and we cannot know everything that he knows.
\v 10 But when everything is perfect  \add after Christ returns\add*, things which are not perfect  \add now\add*, \add such as the abilities which God's Spirit gives us\add*, will be abolished\f + \ft Or: come to an end \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Love has no end to it. If there were people speaking great messages from God, they will stop. If there are people speaking in unknown languages that no person could interpret, but they were known to God, they will all stop. If there is great knowledge to be taught and learned, that will also pass away.
\v 9 For we know only a little of all there is to know, and we proclaim only part of the message we can understand,
\v 10 But when that which is perfect has come to us, that which is imperfect will pass away.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Love never ends. If there are prophecies, they will pass away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will pass away.
\v 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
\v 10 but when the perfect comes, that which is incomplete will pass away.
