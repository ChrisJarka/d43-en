Yahweh continues to speak to Ezekiel.

  * **set the sin of the house of Israel against it**  - The word "it" refers to Ezekiel's left side. Alternate translation: "set the sin of the house of Israel on yourself."
  * **house of Israel** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:01|3:1]].
  * **you will carry their sin**  - Possible meanings are 1) "you will be guilty of their sin" or 2) "you will be punished for their sin." Either of these meanings will be demonstrated "symbolically" by Ezekiel as noted in the UDB. 
  * **lie down against it**  - The word "it" refers to Ezekiel's carving of Jerusalem. 
  * **I myself**  - The word "I" refers to God.
  * **I myself have appointed to you the years of their iniquity as the number of days** - Alternate translation: "I myself have decided to punish you the same number of days as the number of years that I will punish them."
  * **the years of their iniquity** - The word "iniquity" is used here to refer to "punishment." Alternate translation:  "the number of years that they will be punished for their sin." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **So you will carry the sin of the house of Israel** - Alternate translation: "So for that number of days you will carry the sin of the house of Israel."
