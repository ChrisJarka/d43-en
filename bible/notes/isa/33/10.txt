===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **now I will be lifted up; now I will be exalted** - Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize that no one is more powerful than God. AT: "Now everyone will know there is no one more powerful than I am" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **You conceive chaff, you give birth to stubble** - This compares the Assyrians making plans to a woman becoming pregnant and giving birth to a baby. This also compares the plans they create to chaff and stubble. This emphasizes that all of their plans are worthless. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your breath is a fire that will consume you** - This emphasizes that the Assyrians may plan to destroy other but they will end up destroying themselves.
  * **The peoples will be burned to lime, as thorn bushes cut down that are burned in the fire** - This emphasizes that the peoples are easily destroyed before God. AT: "The fire will burn the peoples to ashes just like a farmer cuts down thorn bushes and burns them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
