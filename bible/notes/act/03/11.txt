\v 11 As he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly marvelling.
\v 12 When Peter saw this, he answered the people, "You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you  fix your eyes on us, as if we had made him to walk by our own power or godliness?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **As**  - "While"
  * **the porch that was called Solomon's**  - "Solomon's Porch." Solomon was the name of a king of Israel who had lived long before that time. A porch is a row of pillars covered by a roof, and open on one side. This could be translated as "Solomon's Veranda." Solomon's Porch was very large. 
  * **greatly marveling **  - "full of surprise" or "astonished" or "full of awe"
  * **When Peter saw this**  - "When Peter saw the crowd growing" or "When Peter saw the people" (UDB)
  * **You men of Israel**  - "Fellow Israelites" (UDB). The word for “men” here means specifically males, but the women would have understood that Peter was talking to them too. If the word for “men” in your language would be understood this way, good. If not, a more general term for “people” may be used.
  * **Why do you marvel at this man**  - This is a rhetorical question. Peter was pointing out to the people something that they were doing and telling them that there was no reason for them to do that. It can be translated as a statement as it is in the UDB.
  * **Why do you fix your eyes on us**  - This rhetorical question can also be translated as a statement: "You should not focus on us" or "There is no reason for you to focus on us."
