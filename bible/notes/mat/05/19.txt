\v 19 Since \add all God's laws are important\add*, if anyone disobeys any of those commandments, \add even if it would be\add* one of the least \add important ones\add*, and if that person teaches people \add to disobey any of those commandments\add*, it will be said \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will say \f* that that person is the least \add important\add* of those in the place where \f + \ft euphemism \f* God rules. But those who obey \add those commandments\add* and teach \add other people to obey them, it will be said\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will say \f* that they are very important among those that God rules.
\v 20 Keep this in mind: \add You assume that\add* the Pharisees and the men who teach our laws \add faithfully obey\add* what God commands. But if you do not obey those laws better than they obey them, you will by no means enter the place where God \f + \ft euphemism \f* rules."

\v 19 Because that is true, if you break even a little part of those commands, and if you teach others to break them, you will the least important when God shows himself as king. However, if you keep all those commands and teach others to do the same thing, you will become very important at that time.
\v 20 Because of this, I tell you that you must obey those laws better than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you do not, God will not agree to rule over you.
