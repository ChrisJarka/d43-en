\v 6 When you brought it home, you would call together your friends and neighbors and say to them, 'Be happy with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!'
\v 7 I tell you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* that similarly\add God\add* will be very happy about each and every sinner who turns from doing evil. God does not \add need to\add* be happy about ninety-nine people who \add think that they\add* are \f + \ft irony \f* righteous and think that they do not need to turn from doing evil.

\v 6 And when you come home, you will call together your friends and neighbors and say to them: 'Be joyful with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!'
\v 7 I tell you that, in a similar way, there will be more joy in heaven because of one sinner who repents from his sins than about many righteous people who have already repented.
