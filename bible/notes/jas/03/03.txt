\v 3 To illustrate, if we put a small metal bit into the mouth of a horse in order to cause the horse to obey us, we can turn the horse's large body and cause it to go where we want it to.
\v 4 Think also about ships. Although a ship may be very large and although it can be moved by strong winds, by turning a very small rudder people can direct the ship wherever they want it to go.

\v 3 Now if we put the horsesâ€™ bits into their mouths they obey us, and we can turn their whole bodies.
\v 4 Notice also that ships, although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires to turn.
