  * **in her midst** - "among them"
  * **Morning by morning** - This idiom means "Every day" or "Day after day." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **he will dispense his justice** - Yahweh's just treatment of every person is spoken of as if he was handing out a commodity. AT: "he will treat people justly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It will not be hidden in the light** - This uses a negative statement to emphasize the positive truth that Yahweh's justice is always visible. AT: "His justice is clearly shown to all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
