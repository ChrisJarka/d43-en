\v 1 And David the king said to all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and
the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Jehovah God.
\v 2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the
things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the brass for the
things of brass, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the
things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of various colors, and all
manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
