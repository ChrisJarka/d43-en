===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 16 He has crushed my teeth with gravel; he has pushed me down into ashes. 
[This seems a bit more literal than "he has covered me with ashes," although the main effect is the same, and although the first clause is construed in various ways by various commentators.]
\q
\v 17 You have removed peace from my life; I no longer remember any happiness.
[I give up prosperity.]
\q
\v 18 So I said, "My splendor has perished, so my hope must come from Yahweh!"
Splendor or glory in the sense here of my life, any hope of living further.
This interpretation is possible, because it leads nicely into v. 19. I would have inclined to, "My splendor has perished, and any hope from YHWH."
\b
