\v 3 I pray that God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ will kindly help you and enable you to have peace.
\v 4 Christ offered himself as a sacrifice in order that he might remove the guilt for our sins. Now he can enable us to stop doing the evil things that we see people do. God, who is our Father, wanted Jesus to do this for us.
