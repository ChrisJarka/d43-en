===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a corner of the roof** - Houses in those days had flat roofs. Ancient Israelites spent much time on their roofs, where it was often cooler than inside the house, and sometimes people would build a shelter large enough for a person to sleep in on one corner of the roof. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **quarrelsome** - a person who often argues or complains
  * **The appetite of the wicked craves evil** - The writer speaks of a person's appetite, the physical desire for food and drink, as if it were a person who could desire something. The word "wicked" is a nominal adjective that refers to evil people, and the word "evil" is a nominal adjective that refers to evil deeds. AT: "Evil people desire to do evil deeds just as they desire to eat and drink" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **craves** - "strongly desires"
  * **his neighbor finds no favor in his eyes** - The idiom to "find favor" means to have someone approve of and act kindly towards the one who finds favor. Also, the eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents a person's thoughts and attitude towards another person. AT: "his neighbor does not receive favor from him" or "he does not act kindly towards his neighbor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
