\c 13
\p
\v 1 On that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
\v 2 And there were gathered to him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on
the beach.
\v 3 And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;
\v 4 and as he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:
\v 5 and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no
deepness of earth:
\v 6 and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
\v 7 And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:
\v 8 and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
\v 9 He that has ears, let him hear.
\p
\v 10 And the disciples came, and said to him, Why speak you to them in parables?
\v 11 And he answered and said to them, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
is not given.
\v 12 For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken
away even that which he hath.
\v 13 Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they
understand.
\v 14 And to them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith,
\q By hearing you shall hear, and shall in no wise understand;
\q And seeing you shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:
\q
\v 15 For this people’s heart is waxed gross,
\q And their ears are dull of hearing,
\q And their eyes they have closed;
\q Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes,
\q And hear with their ears,
\q And understand with their heart,
\q And should turn again,
\q And I should heal them.
\m
\v 16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
\v 17 For verily I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and saw them not;
and to hear the things which you hear, and heard them not.
\v 18 Hear then you the parable of the sower.
\v 19 When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands it not,
then comes the evil one, and snatcheth away that which has been sown in his heart. This is he that was
sown by the way side.
\v 20 And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that hears the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;
\v 21 yet has he not root in himself, but endures for a while; and when tribulation or persecution arises because of the
word, straightway he stumbleth.
\v 22 And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that hears the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness
of riches, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
\v 23 And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that hears the word, and understands it; who verily bears
fruit, and brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
\p
\v 24 Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seed in his
field:
\v 25 but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.
\v 26 But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
\v 27 And the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? whence then
has it tares?
\v 28 And he said to them, An enemy has done this. And the servants say to him, Wilt you then that we go and gather them
up?
\v 29 But he saith, Nay; lest haply while you gather up the tares, you root up the wheat with them.
\v 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the
tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.
\p
\v 31 Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took,
and sowed in his field:
\v 32 which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the
birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.
\p
\v 33 Another parable spoke he to them; The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three
measures of meal, till it was all leavened.
\p
\v 34 All these things spoke Jesus in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable spoke he nothing to them:
\v 35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
\q I will open my mouth in parables;
\q I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.
\p
\v 36 Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the
parable of the tares of the field.
\v 37 And he answered and said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;
\v 38 and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil
one;
\v 39 and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.
\v 40 As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.
\v 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and
them that do iniquity,
\v 42 and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
\v 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears, let him hear.
\p
\v 44 The kingdom of heaven is like to a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goes
and selleth all that he hath, and buys that field.
\p
\v 45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:
\v 46 and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
\p
\v 47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
\v 48 which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad
they cast away.
\v 49 So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,
\v 50 and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
\p
\v 51 Have you understood all these things? They say to him, Yea.
\v 52 And he said to them, Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like to a man
that is a householder, who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.
\p
\v 53 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
\p
\v 54 And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence
has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
\v 55 Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and
Judas?
\v 56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then has this man all these things?
\v 57 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in
his own house.
\v 58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
