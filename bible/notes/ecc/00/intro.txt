===What is Ecclesiastes about?===
What is the meaning of life? Ecclesiastes is a group of short teachings which seek to answer this question. It focuses on the futility of seeking a purpose in the things of this world. Any work we perform, or any knowledge or skill we acquire are, in themselves, empty (or done in vain). Ecclesiastes is a series of unrelated thoughts about a variety of subjects, all centered around the  the purpose and worth of the action or quality being discussed. 


===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Ecclesiastes" is another name for "assembly" and is a very vague title. One possible title is "The book of lessons from the teacher" or "The wisdom of the teacher."

===Who wrote Ecclesiastes?===
The author appears to be Solomon, “the Teacher, the descendant of David and king in Jerusalem.” This matches evidence in the book  pointing to Solomon which are consistent with the status and glory of Solomon: his wisdom (see 1:16, and 26 other references to wisdom); his incredible wealth (see 2:8, and the pain which comes from wealth in 5:13-14 and 4:8 and 9:11); the large number of servants (see 2:7, and 10:7); the unending opportunities for worldly pleasures (see 2:1, 2, 10; 3:13; 4:8; 5:4 ; and 12:1); and the expansive nature of his many construction projects (see 2:4-6). The book appears to be written near the end of Solomon's reign as he reflects on how much he wasted his life.

===Why are there so many contradictions in Ecclesiastes?===
Some people have viewed the author as a faithful man, while others see him as a tragic figure. The contradicts within the book may be a reflection of his wavering faith, but it is also possible that the general teachings differ from each other in the book to suit various circumstances in the life of the reader.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
===What is the book's teaching on God's retribution?===

In the ancient Near East, people were concerned with the reason they were being punished or [[:en:obe:kt:bless|blessed]].  They often attributed these acts of [[:en:obe:kt:justice|justice]] or retribution to their [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]]. Ecclesiastes explains that Yahweh will bless the [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteous]] and punish the [[:en:obe:kt:evil]] but it will not be in this life.

===What value did the Israelites place on Ecclesiastes?===
The Israelites have a long history of questioning the value of this book. This is due in large part to its unusual wording and theology. At times, it appears out of place or alignment with the rest of Scripture. While many have questioned its authority, it has ultimately been affirmed to be Scripture because it gives invaluable lessons concerning the futility of a life apart from Yahweh and achieving any goal other than his glory.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

===What is an allegory?===

===What is the meaning of "under the sun?"===
"Under the sun" is another way of saying "on the earth." When the author says that there is "nothing new under the sun," this means that there is nothing that has not happened before on earth. While the referenced event may not have specifically occurred before, there has been something similar that has happened.


===How do I translate harsh or shocking passage?===
There are parts of the book that can be shocking or surprising to read in Scripture. For example, "If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but if his heart is not satisfied with good and he is not buried with honor, then I say that a baby that is born dead is better off than he is" (6:3). The translator should allow these difficulties to remain and not try to "soften" them.
