\v 8 And now for a little moment grace has been showed from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a
nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
\v 9 For we are bondmen; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight
of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us
a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
