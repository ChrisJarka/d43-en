\v 4 After he finished speaking \add to them\add*, he said to Simon, "Push the boat out to where the water is deep. Then let your nets down \add into the water\add* to catch \add some fish\add*!"
\v 5 Simon replied, "Master, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* worked hard all night but we did not catch any \add fish\add*! But because you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* tell me to do it, I will let down the nets."
\v 6 When Peter \add and the men with him\add* had done that, they caught so many fish that their nets were breaking.
\v 7 They motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. So they came and filled both the boats \add with fish from the net\add*. The result was that the boats were so full that they began to sink.

\v 4 After he finished teaching them, he said to Simon, "Take the boat out to deeper water and let your nets down into the water to catch some fish."
\v 5 Simon replied, "Master, we worked hard through the whole night,  and yet we did not catch any fish. But I will let down the nets again, because you told me to."
\v 6 So Simon and his men let down their nets and they caught so many fish that their nets began to break.
\v 7 They motioned to their fishing partners in the other boat to come and help them. So they came and filled both boats so full with fish that they began to sink.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Master**- the word in the original language means someone who has been put in charge over a group of people, not someone who owns someone else. You may want to consider this in your translation. "Boss" or "foreman" are other translations of this word.
    * **at your word**- Simon is saying that he will lower his nets only because Jesus tells him to. He does not think it is a good idea, but he is willing to obey Jesus. He is trusting Jesus' judgment rather than his own.
    * **motioned**  - They were too far from shore to call so they made gestures, probably waving their arms.
    * **the boats began to sink**- When they pulled the nets out of the water and started putting the fish in the boat there were so many fish that the boats were overloaded and began to sink.
    * **bold words**  - explanation
