\v 20 Similarly, when righteous people turn from their righteous behavior and do evil deeds, I will cause bad things to happen [IDI] to them. But you must warn them. If you do not warn them, if they do not stop their sinful behavior, they will die because of their sins; I will not think about the righteous things that they did previously, but I will consider that you are responsible for their deaths .
\v 21 But if you warn righteous people not to sin, and they do not sin, they will surely remain alive because they heeded your warning, and you will have saved yourself from my punishing you."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Again, when a righteous man does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him,
he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done
shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.
\v 21 Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he does not sin, he shall surely live,
because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.
