**What is the Book of Psalms?**\\

The Psalms are songs of praise, prayers for help, confession of sin, pleas for mercy and for victory over enemies, and worship of God for his greatness and love. The 150 psalms in this book became important songs which the Israelites sang to worship God in the temple.

**When was the Book of Psalms written?**\\

The Psalms were written from the 15th Century BC to about the time they were collected in the 3rd Century BC. One of the earliest psalms was written by Moses perhaps about 1400 BC. David’s psalms have been dated between 1020 and 975 BC. Asaph’s psalms are probably from the same time as David’s. The psalms of Korah may have come from the time just before the exile.   

No psalm is identified clearly as having been written after the exile. Psalms 126 and 137 appear to be from the period after the exile, but there is debate about the dates. 

**What are the Messianic psalms?**\\

Some of the psalms, called Messianic psalms, contain passages that the New Testament writers considered were written about the coming Messiah, who turned out to be Jesus Christ. The Messianic psalms are Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 34, 40, 41, 45, 68, 69, 89, 102, 109, 110, and 118. Each is cited at least one time in the New Testament.

**What are superscriptions in the Psalms?**\\

Superscriptions are the information that is given before the beginning of many psalms. Seventy-three psalms are called “A psalm of David,” which may mean they were written by King David, for David, or perhaps in the style of David. For some psalms, the superscriptions give the historical situations in which they were written.

Some superscriptions give instructions about how they should be played and sung, with what instruments, with which singers, and apparently sometimes with which melodies. Fifty-five psalms are addressed “to the choirmaster” or “chief musician;” these seem to have been specially meant for use in temple worship.

English versions do not traditionally give verse numbers to the superscriptions, but many versions in other languages do. Whatever choice is made in other versions, the superscriptions in the Psalms should be considered as part of the divinely inspired biblical test.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**Why does the ULB display the psalms as poetry, but the UDB does not?**\\

The Psalms were written as Hebrew poetry. This style uses poetic lines that stand in different kinds of relationships with each other. Usually they are “parallel” to each other. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]].) The ULB show these lines of poetry in English. 

However, many translators will decide not to use poetic lines. The UDB provides a model for these translators.
