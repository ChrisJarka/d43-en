  * **Astonish yourselves and be astonished** - The word "yourselves" refers to the people of Jerusalem. Why they are astonished can be made explicit. AT: "Be astonished at what I am telling you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **blind yourselves and be blind** - The people ignoring what Yahweh says is spoken of as if they would make themselves blind. AT: "keep being ignorant and spiritually blind to what I am showing you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not with beer** - The people being senseless and not sensitive to what Yahweh is doing is spoken of as if they were drunk. AT: "Be senseless like a drunk person, but it is not because you have drank too much wine or beer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For Yahweh has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep** - Yahweh causing the people to be senseless and not sensitive to what he is doing is spoken of as if he caused them to sleep and not be able to wake up easily. AT: "The reason you are senseless is because Yahweh has caused you to be spiritually asleep" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **has poured out on you the spirit** - Here "spirit" means "to have the characteristic of." And, Yahweh causing the people have this characteristic is spoken of as if "the spirit" were a liquid that he poured out on the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **He has closed your eyes, the prophets, and has covered your heads, the seers** - Sleep and darkness are symbols of being insensitive. AT: "He has made your prophets and seers unable to hear and understand his message" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
