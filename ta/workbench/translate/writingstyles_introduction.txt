===== Description =====

The first time that people or things are mentioned in a story, they are __new participants__. After that whenever they are mentioned they are __old participants__.

**Now __there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus__... __This man__ came to Jesus at night time... Jesus replied to __him__** (John 3:1) - The first underlined phrase introduces Nicodemus as a new participant. He is then referred to as "This man" and "him." when he is an old participant.

Reason this is a translation issue: In order to make your translation clear and natural, it is necessary to properly mark the participants so people will know if they are new participants or ones that they have already read about.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

  - In most languages new participants are introduced with a clause telling something about them.
  - After that in many languages the participant is referred to with a pronoun where it is clear who is being referred to.
  - In languages where the subject is marked in the verb, many languages do not mark old participants.  
===== Translation Strategies =====


===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

 1. In most languages new participants are introduced with a clause telling something about them.
  * ** There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai.** (Esther 2:6)
 2. After that in many languages the participant is referred to with a pronoun where it is clear who is being referred to.
  * **__He__ had been taken away from Jerusalem with the exiles** Since Mordecai had already been mentioned, he is referred to here with the pronoun "he".\\ 
 3. In languages where the subject is marked in the verb, many languages do not mark old participants.\\
  * This can not be illustrated with English because English does not mark the subject in the verb.
