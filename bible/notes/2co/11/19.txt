\v 19 \add I am sure that you, who think that you are so wise, will accept what I say\add* because you gladly \add accept the\add* false teachers and the foolish things \add that they say\add*.
\v 20 When people \add treat\add* you as if they were your bosses, you gladly submit \add to them. You think that it is all right when others\add* force you provide for their needs. You think that it is all right\add when people\add* take control over you, when they boast about themselves, \add or when they insult you by\add* slapping you in the face.
\v 21 I agree that I was not bold enough to treat you in such ways. \add So do you think that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* I should feel ashamed \add because I did not do that?\add*
\p So now, talking like a person who does not have any sense, I will boldly tell you \add some things about myself, just like those false apostles tell you things about themselves\add*.

\v 19 For you gladly put up with fools, being wise yourselves!
\v 20 For you put up with someone if he enslaves you, if he causes division among you, if he takes advantage of you, if he puts on airs, or if he slaps you in the face.
\v 21 I speak out of shame, as though we had been weak. Yet whenever anyone is bold (I am speaking as a fool), I also am bold.
