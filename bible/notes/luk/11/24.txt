\v 24 \add Then Jesus said this\add*: "\add Sometimes when\add* an evil spirit leaves someone, it wanders around in desolate areas seeking \add someone in whom it can\add* rest. If it does not find anyone, it says \add to itself\add*, 'I will return to the person in whom I used to live!'
\v 25 So it goes back and finds that \add the Spirit of God is not in control of that person's life. The person's life is like\add* a house that has been \f + \ft Or:that someone has \f* swept clean and everything put \f + \ft Or:put everything \f* in order, \add but a house that is empty\add*.
\v 26 Then \add this evil spirit\add* goes and gets seven other spirits that are \add even\add* more evil than it is. They \add all\add* enter \add that person\add* and \add begin\add* living there. \add So\add*, \add although\add* that person's condition \add was bad\add* before, it became much worse."

\v 24 When the unclean spirit has gone out from * a man it passes through waterless places seeking rest and finding none says, "I will return to my house from where I came."

\v 25 And having come *, he finds it swept and adorned.

\v 26 Then it goes and receives seven other spirits more evil than itself * and having come * they live there, the last condition * of that man becomes even * worse than the first.
