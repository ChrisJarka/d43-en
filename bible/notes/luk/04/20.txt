===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **synagogue attendant**  - a man who worked at the synagogue (cultural customs would have prevented this being a woman). In this case, a person who had ceremonial custody of seeing that the scrolls containing the Scriptures were brought out and put away with proper care and reverence.
    * **were fixed on him**- that is, they were staring at him
    * **this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing**-
    * **all of them were amazed **- that is, the were very surprised.
    * **Isn't this Joseph's son?**  - This could also be translated as, "Isn't this just Joseph's son?" People thought that Joseph was Jesus father. Joseph was not a religious leader, so they were surprised that his son would would preach the kinds of things he was preaching. It could also be translated as "This is just Joseph's son" or "His father is only Joseph." (See: Rhetorical Question).
