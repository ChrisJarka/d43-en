\p
\v 15 My friends there at Philippi, you yourselves know that during the time I first proclaimed the message about Christ to you, when I left there to go to Macedonia province, you were the only group of believers  in order that I might proclaim that message to others just like I did for you.
\v 16 Even when I was in Thessalonica city, you sent money  in order to supply what I needed.
\v 17 I say this, not because I desire that you give me money now. Instead, I desire that God will abundantly bless  you as a result of your helping me.

\v 14 But you did well that you reached out to me in my affliction.
\v 15 And you Philippians know that in the beginning of the gospel ministry, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had supported me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only;
\v 16 For even in Thessalonica you provided for my needs two times.
\v 17 Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account.
