===== Audio Interfaces =====

//This page answers the question:// //How are good options for audio interfaces?//

Audio interfaces are used to connect a standard professional XLR mic to a laptop.

==== USB Audio Interfaces ====

The following USB Audio Interfaces are recommended for their excellent feature sets, ease of use, durability and stability in USB connectivity.

  * Presonus Audiobox - excellent sound quality, quiet preamps, easy to setup and operate

  * Focusrite Scarlet Solo - excellent sound quality, quiet preamps, extremely easy to setup and operate

//Note:// Firmware drivers must be obtained from the manufacturer's website or may be included on a CD with the interface.

==== Firewire Audio Interfaces ====

We currently have not tested any 1 or 2 channel Firewire audio interfaces for voice recording. Our experience with Firewire interfaces is several years old and primarily with an 8 channel configuration. Therefore, even though Firewire is still an excellent option, we are unable to provide any specific recommendations on equipment.

Firewire has become less popular in recent years as USB has become the preferred configuration (especially in 1-4 channel interfaces) because of advancements in USB data transfer speed, affordability and virtually 100% compatibility with any computer. In fact, Firewire connections have become extremely difficult to find on computers built in the last few years. For this reason and others, we do not recommend Firewire as a new investment for voice recording. However, if a Firewire device is available and your computer has a compatible Firewire port and chipset, the interface will likely yield excellent results.
