===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Dear ones, whom God loves, since God has given us these promises, let us remove all moral filth from us and anything that would stand in the way of our worshiping of God. Let us clean ourselves outwardly and inwardly, in body and in spirit, as we cautiously move toward our God who is holy. We tremble because he commands us to be holy. God is not like us, he has all holiness in himself and his holiness makes us tremble with fear.
