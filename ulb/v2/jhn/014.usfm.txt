\c 14
\p
\v 1 Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in me.
\v 2 In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
\v 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am,
there you may be also.
\v 4 And whither I go, you know the way.
\v 5 Thomas says to him, Lord, we know not whither you goest; how know we the way?
\v 6 Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one comes to the Father, but by me.
\v 7 If you had known me, you would have known my Father also: from henceforth you know him, and have seen him.
\v 8 Philip says to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
\v 9 Jesus says to him, Have I been so long time with you, and do you not know me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen
the Father; how say thou, Show us the Father?
\v 10 Believest you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I say to you I speak not from myself:
but the Father living in me does his works.
\v 11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.
\v 12 Verily, verily, I say to you, He that believes on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater
works than these shall he do; because I go to the Father.
\v 13 And whatever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
\v 14 If you shall ask anything in my name, that will I do.
\v 15 If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
\v 16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever,
\v 17 even the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it sees him not, neither knows him: you
know him; for he remains with you, and shall be in you.
\v 18 I will not leave you desolate: I come to you.
\v 19 Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you behold me: because I live, you shall live also.
\v 20 In that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
\v 21 He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my
Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
\v 22 Judas (not Iscariot) says to him, Lord, what is come to pass that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the
world?
\v 23 Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come
to him, and make our abode with him.
\v 24 He that loves me not keeps not my words: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
\p
\v 25 These things have I spoken to you, while yet living with you.
\v 26 But the Comforter, even the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things,
and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.
\v 27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you: not as the world giveth, give I to you. Let not your heart be
troubled, neither let it be fearful.
\v 28 You heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come to you. If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the
Father: for the Father is greater than I.
\v 29 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, you may believe.
\v 30 I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he has nothing in me;
\v 31 but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go
hence.
