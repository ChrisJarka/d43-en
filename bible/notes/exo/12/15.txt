\v 15 For seven days you will eat bread without yeast. On the first day you will remove the yeast from your houses. Whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.
\v 16 On the first day there will be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there will be a holy convocation. No work will be done on these days, except the cooking for everyone to eat--that is the only work that may be done by you.
