===== Description =====

This module answers the question: What is a metonymy?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]] \\ 
Summary\\
Many times the Bible uses metonymy. If you do not recognize it as a metonymy you will not understand the passage or worse yet, get the wrong understanding of the passage. \\ 

Definition\\
Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. A //**metonym**// is a word or phrase used as a substitute for something it is associated with.

Examples\\ 
**and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.** (1 John 1:7) \\
The blood substitutes for the atoning death \\  
**The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ?** (1 Corinthians 10:16) \\ 
The cup is for what is in the cup.
 
Purpose \\
Metonymy can be used:
  * as a shorter way of referring to something
  * to make an abstract idea more meaningful by referring to it with the name of a concrete object associated with it.
  * to keep certain people from knowing what is being referred to
=== Reason this could be a translation issue ===
There are many metonymies in the Bible. If they are not recognized for what they substitute for, they will be badly misunderstood.


===== Examples from the Bible =====

>**The Lord God will give him __the throne__  of his father, David.**  (Luke 1:32 ULB) \\ 
A throne represents the authority of a king. Throne is a metonym for "kingly authority," "kingship" or, "reign". This means that God would make him become the king that was to follow King David.
 
>**Immediately his mouth was opened** (John 1:64 ULB) \\ 
The mouth here represents the power to speak. This means he was able to talk again.
 
>**who warned you to flee from __the wrath__  to come?**  (Luke 3:7b) \\ 
The word "wrath" or "anger" is a metonym for "punishment." God was extremely angry with the people, and as a result, he would punish them, 

>**The elder to the __elect lady__ and __her children__,** (2 John 1) \\ 
John is writing to a persecuted church. If the government should find his letter, he does not want the government to know there is a church there.

===== Translation Strategies =====

  - If a metonym is easily recognized what it refers to, use the metonym.
  - If the metonym is simply an idiom, or if it would be unclear to the readers, use the name of the thing the metonym refers to. (See Idiom)
