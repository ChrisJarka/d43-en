\v 16 So the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* started to harass Jesus, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f*.
\v 17 Then Jesus replied to them, "My Father has always been working every day, \add including\add* \add the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: the day of rest\add* \f*, up until now. I am doing the same thing!"
\v 18 The Jewish leaders \f + \ft synecdoche \f* considered that he was disobeying their rules about the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: the day of rest \f*, and that by saying that God was his Father, he was making himself equal with God. And they considered that both these things were grounds for killing him. So they sought even harder for a way to kill him.

\v 16 So the Jews started to persecute Jesus because he was doing many of his mighty signs on the Sabbath day.
\v 17 Jesus gave this answer to them, "My Father is working until now, and I am also working."
\v 18 This is why the Jews were seeking more and more to kill Jesus, not only because he was breaking the Sabbath day (in their understanding of religious rules) but even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God, which they would consider blasphemy, a crime deserving death.

\v 16 And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.
\v 17 But Jesus answered them, My Father works even until now, and I work.
\v 18 For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God
his own Father, making himself equal with God.
