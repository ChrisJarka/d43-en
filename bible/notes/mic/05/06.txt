\v 6 They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword,
\q and the land of Nimrod in its entrances.
\f + \ft The Hebrew text has \fqa in its entrances \fqa* , that is, in their gates. However, some modern versions suppose that a different Hebrew word was intended: \fqa with a drawn sword \fqa* . \f* 
\q He will rescue us from the Assyrians,
\q when they come into our land,
\q when they march inside our borders.
\q
\v 7 The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples,
\q like dew from Yahweh,
\q like showers on the grass,
\q that do not wait for a man,
\q and they do not wait for the children of mankind.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in its entrances** - The sword is a metonym for killing in war. Here the Israelites ruling over the Assyrians is spoken of ironically as if they were killing sheep instead of herding them. The land of Assyria is a metonym for the people who live there. The entrances to cities were where official business took place. AT: "They will make war against the people of Assyria, and they will rule the cities of the land of Nimrod" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **They will shepherd the land of Assyria ... and the land of Nimrod** - You may need to repeat the words omitted in the ellipsis. AT: "They will shepherd the land of Assyria ... and they will shepherd the land of Nimrod" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **land of Nimrod** - This is another name for the land of Assyria. Nimrod was a hunter and early ruler. Translators may add this footnote: "The name 'Nimrod' means 'rebellion.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **He will rescue** - The ruler will rescue
  * **like dew from Yahweh, like showers on the grass** - Dew and rain showers refresh the land and cause things to grow. The Israelites will cause the people among whom they live to live will. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **grass, that do not wait for a man, and they do not wait for the children** - "grass. It is not for a man that they wait, nor is it for the children." It is Yahweh alone who causes dew and rain showers.
