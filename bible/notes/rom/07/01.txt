===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you- ** Here, Paul is addressing Jewish Christians.
  * **the law controls a person for as long as he lives-  ** This means that if a person is under the law, rather than under grace as a Christian, he or she is required to follow the law.  Paul gives an example of this in verse 2 where he talks about a married woman.
