\v 5 You must not only return anything like that to its owner, but you must also pay to the owner one-fifth of its value.
\v 6 You must also bring to the priest a ram to be an offering to Yahweh in order that you will no longer be guilty. The ram that you bring must be one that has no defects, one that has the value that has been officially determined.
\v 7 Then the priest will offer that ram to be a sacrifice that will cause you to no longer be guilty, and you will be forgiven for the wrong things that you did."

\v 5 Or if he lied about any matter, he must restore it in full and must add one fifth more to pay him to whom it is owed, on the day that he is found guilty.
\v 6 Then he must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh: a ram without blemish from the flock that is worth the current value, as a guilt offering to the priest.
\v 7 The priest will make atonement for him before Yahweh, and he will be forgiven concerning whatever he has become guilty of doing."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in full** - "fully" or "totally"
  * **add one fifth** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lev:05:14|5:16]].
  * **to pay him to whom it is owed** - Yahweh's penalty for stealing is to make restitution to the person they stole it from. This can be translated in active form. AT: "to pay the person he owes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **he is found guilty** - The person who stole is to be brought before the judge and be declared guilty. Translate this so it is clear that Israel's judge will declare the person guilty. AT: "the judge declares him guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **he will be forgiven** - This means Yahweh will forgive the person, not the priest. This can be translated in active form. AT: "God will forgive him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
