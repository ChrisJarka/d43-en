<usfm>
\v 5 It is true that just like Christ suffered, we \add who serve him\add* also continually suffer \add because we belong to him\add*. But also, because we \add belong to\add* Christ, God greatly strengthens us just as\f + \ft Or: just like \f* \add God strengthened him\add*.
\v 6 So, whenever we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* experience sufferings, we \add learn how to encourage\add* you \add when you experience sufferings. As a result, you will become more and more the kind of people God\add* wants you to be. Whenever \add God\add* strengthens us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* in our sufferings, he\add* does that in order that you \add may see how he makes us strong when we are suffering. Then, as God\add* encourages \add you in that way\add*, you will learn to continue patiently \add trusting him\add* when you suffer as we do.
\v 7 As a result, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* strongly expect that because you suffer just as\f + \ft Or: just \f* like we do, \add God\add* will encourage you just as\f + \ft Or: just like \f* \add he\add* encourages us.

\v 5 We experience sufferings that are impossible even to measure, they are the kind that Christ experienced, but we also experience unmeasurable comfort from Christ.
\v 6 So, whenever we experience sufferings, it is so that God may comfort you and that  God may save you. Whenever God strengthens us in our sufferings, he does that in order that you may receive his comfort in your lives. Then you will learn to endure your trials with great patience when you suffer as we suffer.
\v 7 We are certain about what will happen to you: because you suffer like we suffer, you also will experience God's comfort just as we do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 For just as we experience the sufferings of Christ which are beyond all measure,  we also experience through Christ comfort that cannot be measured.
\v 6 But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. Or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which works when you patiently share in the same sufferings that we also suffer.
\v 7 And our hope for you is certain, knowing that as you also share the sufferings, you also share the comfort.
