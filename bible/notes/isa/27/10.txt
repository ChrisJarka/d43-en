\v 10 The cities that have strong walls around them will be empty;
\q2 like the desert, they will have no one living in them.
\q1 The houses will be abandoned,
\q2 and the streets will be full of weeds.
\q1 Calves will eat grass there and lie down there;
\q2 they will chew up all the leaves on the trees.
\q1
\v 11 \add The Israelite people are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* dry branches on a tree;
\q2 women break them off and use them to make fires \add under their cooking pots\add*.
\q1 Our Israelite people do not have any sense;
\q2 so Yahweh, who created them, will not act mercifully toward them
\q2 or be kind to them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For the fortified city is desolate, the habitation is deserted and forsaken like the wilderness**-
The defenced city;  Jerusalem, and the rest of the defenced cities in the land, the singular number being put for the plural. \\ This city is compared to a tree, whose branches are not only gnawed and consumed by cattle, as in the former verse
  * **the calf feeds**- Here "calf" is referring to numerous cattle. (See: Synecdoche)
  * **bold words**  - and women come, without fear of trespassing, to gather them for firewood.
  * **bold words**  - set … on fire—burn them as fuel; "women" are specified, as probably it was their office to collect fuel and kindle the fire for cooking.

no understanding—as to the ways of God

  * **bold words**  -
They shall be broken off,  that there may be no hopes nor possibility of their recovery. \\  \\
The women;  he mentions women, either because it is their usual work in the country to make fires, and to gather fuel for them, or to signify that the men should be generally destroyed. \\
  * **bold words**  - By a sudden introduction of metaphor, the city becomes a tree, the prophet's thought going back, perhaps, to ver. 6. "Withered boughs" are indications of internal rottenness, and must be "broken off" to give the tree a chance of recovery.
