====== Does This Term Require a Page? ======

Why do some terms labeled have OBE pages, and other do not? To become an OBE term, a word or phrase should have these characteristics:

  - it needs more than a sentence or two in the notes to explain how to translate it accurately
  - it appears often in the Bible, so it is more efficient to link to another page than to keep repeating the explanation in the notes

If a word has a simple definition that an average speaker would be expected to know from a dictionary, it should not be an OBE term.

==== Two Types of OBE Terms ====

There are two types of OBE terms:

  * OBE Key Terms
  * OBE Other Terms

The Key Terms are more significant theologically, and require special care in their translation. Deciding which category is the right place for a term is actually more art than science. In general, "Key Terms" provide more explanation and translation guidance than the "Other Terms."
