\v 9 Because of our future life with the Lord in heaven, we want to please him in all we do, whether that is to please him here on earth or to please him when we come to our home with him in heaven.
\v 10 For we must give an account of our lives to Christ when we appear before him as the Judge of all. His judgment is true and final, and all of us he will judge fairly for all we have done while we lived on the earth. If we did good things or bad, Christ will decide with absolute justice, and he will give us all that we deserve.
