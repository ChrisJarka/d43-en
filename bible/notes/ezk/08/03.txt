\v 3 He reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up high above the earth, and in visions God took me \add from Babylon\add* to Jerusalem. He took me \add to the temple\add* to the north gate, to the place where there was an idol that caused Yahweh to be very disgusted and furious.
\v 4 And there in front of me was the brilliant light that indicated the presence of the God whom the Israelite people \add previously worshiped\add*. It was like the vision that I had seen alongside the Kebar River\f + \ft Or: Canal \f*.

\v 3 And he reached out the form of a hand and took me by the hair of my head; the Spirit lifted me up between earth and
heaven, and brought me in visions from God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner Northern Gate, where was standing the idol that provokes great jealousy.
\v 4 And the glory of the God of Israel, whose appearance was the same as I had seen in the plain, was there.
