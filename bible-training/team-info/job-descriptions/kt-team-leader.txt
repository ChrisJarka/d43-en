====== Key Terms Team Leader ======


==== Team Purpose ==== 

The Key Terms (KT) team will write and update the content of the KT pages. These pages will provide concise, clear explanations of important words, people, people, places, things, and phrases that require more than a brief note. 

The KT pages should present all the necessary information about the term that a translator would need to accurately represent it in his/her own language. They should also provide alternative translation suggestions as possible. In addition, the KT pages should be cross-linked with other KT pages as helpful.

The content of KT pages are not specific to any particular book. They should present the meaning of the term across the Bible. Also, they will need to occasionally be updated as the Notes teams work on new books and discover additional issues not yet covered by the KT pages.

All of the content developed will be released as open-source, unrestricted materials. No copyrighted materials should be included in their creation. It is also understood that the team agrees to have the product of their work freely distributed as open-source.
