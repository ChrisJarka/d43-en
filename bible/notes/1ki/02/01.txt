\p
\v 1 Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
\v 2 I am going the way of all the earth: be you strong therefore, and show yourself a man;
\v 3 and keep the charge of Jehovah your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes,
and his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of
Moses, that you may prosper in all that you doest, and wherever you turn thyself;
\v 4 that Jehovah may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If your children take heed to their way, to walk
before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you (said he) a man on the throne of
Israel.
