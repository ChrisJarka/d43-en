\v 4 And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant,
against David; because he has not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:
\v 5 for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and Jehovah wrought a great victory for all Israel: you saw
it, and did rejoice; wherefore then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David wiyout a cause?
