This module answers the question: What is a metaphor?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

==== Definition ====

A metaphor occurs when something (the **topic**) is spoken of as if it were something else (the **image**). The speaker usually does this in order to help his audience understand what he is saying about that thing. 

Some metaphors are easy to identify, such as when Jesus referred to the inhabitants of Jerusalem as the children of Jerusalem ([[en:bible:notes:luk:13:34]]). 

But many other metaphors are difficult to identify because their foundations are hidden. For example, //[God] does not hide his face from them// (Ps. 22:24) is a metaphor in which someone' face stands for his presence among others. This passage means that God does not withdraw from those people.

This hidden foundation can lead us to different related thoughts: for example, someone might "seek God's face" ([[en:bible:notes:psa:027:007]]), which means that someone might try to get God's attention. Someone might "come before God's face" ([[en:bible:notes:heb:09:23]]), that is, into God's presence.


==== Purposes of Metaphor ====

  * One purpose of metaphor is to teach about something that is unknown (the **topic**) by indicating that it is similar to something that is already known (the **image**).
  * Another purpose of metaphor is to emphasize that something has a particular quality or to indicate that it has that quality in an extreme way.
  * Another purpose of metaphor is to lead people to react emotionally to one thing as they would to another.
  * Often metaphors are the favorite way for speakers of any given language to talk about something. For example, when English speakers want to talk about increasing amounts of something, they often talk about something going up or down ("The literacy rate is going up." "The price of bread has gone down"). Many other languages require their speakers to say these things in other ways.

==== Translation Strategies====

  * If the image in the original language is unknown to your people or is not used in the same way, it is often possible to use an image from your own culture. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. 
  * If the image in the original language is unknown to your people, it is often possible to simply state the truth that the original metaphor wanted to communicate. For example, "the children of Jerusalem" ([[en:bible:notes:luk:13:34]]) could be restated as "the people living in Jerusalem."
  * If the topic is not stated clearly in the original, and if it would also be unclear to your readers, state the topic clearly. However, do not do this if the topic was not clear to the original audience. For example, in Matthew 16:6, Jesus told his disciples "Beware of the __yeast__  of the Pharisees and Sadducees." His disciples thought he was talking about bread, but Jesus was warning them about the __teaching__  of the Pharisees and Sadducees. That was the topic, but it was unstated, and the disciples did not understand it at first. If the metaphor were fully stated, it would be, "The teaching of the Pharisees is like yeast." This sentence would communicate the fact that both teachings and yeast spread throughout whatever they touch and change it.
  * If the target audience would not understand the metaphor, then change the metaphor to a simile by adding "like" or "as."
  * If the biblical metaphor seems to be a normal way for the biblical language to say something, then ask yourself if people in your own language say it in the same way. If not, use the normal way that your language says it. For example, "[Stephen] fell asleep" (en:bible:notes:act:07:59) can be translated, "Stephen died."
  * See the list of common biblical underlying metaphors. 

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>Jesus said to them. “I am the __bread of life__. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who trusts in me will never be thirsty." John 6:35 

Jesus compared himself to bread, a food that people ate all the time then. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to trust in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.

>… __the rising sun will__  come from heaven to help us, __to shine__  on those who sit in __darkness__  and the __shadow of death__.  Luke 1:78b-79a

This verse has several related metaphors. The Savior is compared to the rising sun, teaching spiritual truth is compared to the sun shining, lacking spiritual truth is compared to sitting in darkness, and the fear of death is compared to a shadow. This means that just as the rising sun shines on those who have been living in darkness, the Savior will come and bring spiritual truth to those who lack spiritual truth and are afraid of death.

==== Examples from English ====

>"He was a walking __dictionary__."

Because he knows the meanings of so many words, he is compared to a dictionary. Dictionaries contain the meanings of many words.

>"Her __heart broke__ when her baby died."

Her heart, or emotions, is compared to a physical thing that can break.
