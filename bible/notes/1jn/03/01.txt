\v 1 \add Think about\add* how much our Father loves us! He allows us to say that we are\f + \ft Or: be called \f* his children! \add And it is indeed true that\add* we are \add his children. But people in\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add who are unbelievers\add* have not understood \add who\add* God \add is\add*. So they do not understand \add who we are\add*, that we \add are God's children\add*.
\v 2 Dear friends, even though at present\f + \ft Or: now \f* we are God's children, \add he\add* has not yet made clear\f + \ft Or: revealed \f* \add to us\add* what we will be like \add in the future\add*. However, we know that when \add Christ\add* comes back again, we will be like him, because we will see what he is \add really\add* like.
\v 3 \add So\add*, all those who confidently expect \add to see\add* \add Christ as he actually is\f + \ft Or: what \f* Christ is like when he returns\add* must keep themselves pure in every way, just like Christ, who is pure in every way.

\p
\v 1 Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God, and we are! For this reason, the world does not know us, because it did not know him.
\v 2 Beloved, now are we children of God, and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be. We know that, when he is appears, we shall be like him for we shall see him even as he is.
\v 3 And every one that has this hope set on him purifies himself, just as he is pure.
