\v 43 Then said I of her that was old in adulteries, Now will they play the harlot with her, and she
with them.
\v 44 And they went in to her, as they go in to a harlot: so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.
\v 45 And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women that shed
blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
