====== Synecdoche [siˈnekdəkē] ======


=== In synecdoche something is not called not by its own name, but by the name of a part of that thing or by the name of something that the thing is a part of.

 When something is called by one of its parts, it is not a random part that is chosen. It is usually a part that is significant to what is being said about the thing.

When something is called by some bigger thing that it is a part of, it is usually because there is something significant about that bigger thing. ===


**Examples from English** \\
