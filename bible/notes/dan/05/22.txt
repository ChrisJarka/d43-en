<usfm>
\v 22 Now, Belshazzar, you have become the king. You also knew all these things, but you have not made yourself humble.
\v 23 You have considered yourself to be greater than \add God\add*, the Lord of heaven. So you have commanded your servants to bring to you these sacred cups, \add which were dedicated to the Supreme God\add*, and which were taken from his temple \add in Jerusalem\add*. You and your officials and your wives and your concubines\f + \ft Or: slave wives \f* have been drinking wine from these cups, while you have been praising your own gods—gods which are made of gold and silver and bronze and iron and wood and stone. Those are gods that cannot see, that cannot hear, and that do not know anything! You have not honored the God who gives you breath and who controls everything that happens to you.
\v 24 So God sent this hand to write a message \add for you\add*.

\v 22 And you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, yough you knew all this,
\v 23 but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and
you and your lords, your wives and your concubines, have drunk wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold,
of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all
your ways, have you not glorified.
\v 24 Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.
