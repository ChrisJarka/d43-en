\c 127
\d A Song of Ascents; of Solomon.
\q
\v 1 Except Jehovah build the house,
\q They labor in vain that build it:
\q Except Jehovah keep the city,
\q The watchman wakes but in vain.
\q
\v 2 It is vain for you to rise up early,
\q To take rest late,
\q To eat the bread of toil;
\q For so he gives to his beloved sleep.
\q
\v 3 Lo, children are a heritage of Jehovah;
\q And the fruit of the womb is his reward.
\q
\v 4 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
\q So are the children of youth.
\q
\v 5 Happy is the man that has his quiver full of them:
\q They shall not be put to shame,
\q When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
