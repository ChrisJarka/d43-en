====== Ellipsis ======

The ellipsis is a punctuation mark and literary device that depicts a pause in the flow of a sentence. An ellipsis is indicated with three dots in a row (e.g. …) and may occur in the beginning, middle or end of a sentence. An ellipsis may show a literal pause in the stream of action, as in "John thought…and thought some more."

It may also indicate an incomplete thought at the end of a sentence, as in "John wanted to pick up the phone, but…."

When used in the beginning of a sentence, it indicates action preceded the piece of information given (but that that information is not essential to the reader.)

Ellipses used in such a manner allow the reader to think and feel as they read. The reader has the freedom to reflect on 'why' there is a pause but the meaning remains unchanged (regardless of 'why').

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Finally, an ellipsis may indicate a portion of information the author feels is non-essential has been left out of the sentence. Typically, this use refers to</font>    implicit <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>information</font>    <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>, see:</font>    <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>(</font>    [[:en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]]<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>) but may also be to focus the reader's attention on a specific aspect of the sentence. This use is common with quotes.</font>

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Consider this quote: "Ten missionaries, originally from India and Bangladesh visited the station with news of great revival in the Sudan." It would be a reasonable use of an ellipsis to write: "Ten missionaries…visited the station with news of great revival in the Sudan." The only portion of the quote which pertained to the author's purpose was that which told of the revival in Sudan.</font>

===== Examples from English =====

In the following sentence, "//John can play the guitar and Mary can, too", t//he action that Mary does has been omitted because that is a natural way to express this in English. If the implied information is made explicit, the sentence would be, "//John can play the guitar and Mary can **play the guitar**, too". // Some languages may need to include this implied information in order for the meaning to be clear.
===== Examples from the Bible =====

Luke 21:10 - //Then he said to them, "Nations will rise against other nations, and kingdoms against other kingdoms."// Some languages may need to include the implied information and say, "//Then he said to them, "Nations will rise against other nations, and kingdoms **will rise** against other kingdoms."//The phrase "will rise" is not made explicit in Greek or English because it is understood without it.
