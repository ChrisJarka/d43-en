===== Sentence Types =====

//This answers the question:// //What are the different types of sentences?//
==== Description ====

A **sentence** is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. The basic types of sentences are:

   * **Statement**  - These are usually used to give information. '//This is a fact.//'
  * **Question**  - These are usually used to ask for information. '//Do you know him?//'
  * **Exclamation**  - These are usually used to express a strong feeling. 'Ouch, that hurt!'
  * **Command**  - These are usually used to make something happen. '//Pick that up.//'

  * In some languages some of these sentence types can be used for some of the purposes of the other types. For example, in some languages questions can also be used as a statement or an exclamation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * Languages have different ways of showing that a statement is an exclamation.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

**Examples of Exclamations**

The word "Oh" is often used at the beginning of an exclamation.

>__Oh__ foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! (Luke 24:25 ULB)

Exclamations often are not full sentences with a subject and predicate. The exclamation below has only nouns and prepositions, but no verb.

>Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

Exclamations in English often have a question word such as "how" or "why"?

>__How__ unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

**Examples of Commands**

Some commands are not spoken to the person or thing being commanded. In English these have the word "let" or "may".

>Whoever sends his wife away,__ let him give__ her a certificate of divorce. (Matthew 5:31 ULB)
