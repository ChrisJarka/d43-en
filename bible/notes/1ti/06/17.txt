\v 17 Tell  the believers who are rich here in this present world that they should not be proud, and that they should not trust in their many possessions, because they cannot be certain how long they will have them. Teach them that they should not trust in their wealth. Instead, they should trust in God. He is the one who abundantly gives us everything we have in order that we may enjoy it.
\ v 17 Declare to those who are now wealthy in this present age, not to be proud, neither to place their hope in uncertain riches, but instead, they must hope in God who lives. He offers to us all that is true wealth to enjoy.
\v 18 Also, tell them that their good deeds must be as plentiful as their money. Specifically, they should share very generously with others what they have.
\v 19 If they do that, Jesus will give them a great reward. It will be as though they are storing up in heaven much treasure for themselves that will be a good basis on which they may rely for receiving a great reward in the future. By doing this they will have the life that is the real life.
