\v 25 But if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die:
\v 26 but to the damsel you shall do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and kills him, even so is this matter;
\v 27 for he found her in the field, the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.
