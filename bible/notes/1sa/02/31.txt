\v 31 Listen carefully! There will soon be a time when I will cause all the strong \add young men\add* in your family to die. The result will be that no men in your family will \add live long enough to\add* become old men.
\v 32 You will be distressed and envious as you see the blessings that I will give to the \add other people in\add* Israel. And \add I repeat that\add* no men in your family will ever live long enough to become old men.
\v 33 There is one of your descendants whom I will spare, and not prevent him from serving me as a priest. But he will become blind, and then he will always be sad and grieving. But all your other descendants will die violently.

\v 31 See, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your fatherâ€™s house, so there will not be an old man in your house.
\v 32  You will see distress in my dwelling place, in spite of all the prosperity that I, God, will give Israel; from now on, there will be no old man in your house.
\v 33  The man of your descendants whom I do not cut off from my altar, will be kept alive in order to become blind in his eyes and to grieve in his heart; and all the rest of your descendants will die in the prime of life.
