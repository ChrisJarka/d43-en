\v 22 As for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take into captivity, over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.
\v 23 Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah. They were Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of
Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
