\v 12 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets
declare good to the king with one mouth: let your word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak you
good.
\v 13 And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what my God saith, that will I speak.
\v 14 And when he was come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I
forbear? And he said, Go you up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand.
