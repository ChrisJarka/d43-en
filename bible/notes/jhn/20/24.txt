===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 24 One of us disciples, Thomas, the one whom we called The Twin, was not with us when Jesus appeared to us. \v 25 When the rest of us told him that we had seen the Lord, he said to us, "If I do not see the marks of the nails in his hands and put my fingers in the place where the nails were, and put my hands into the place in his side \add where the soldier thrust the spear\add*, I will certainly not believe \add that he was the one you saw\add*!"

<usfm> \v 24 Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, who was called "The Twin," was not with the other disciples when Jesus came to them. \v 25 The other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord." However, he said to them, "Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands and put my fingers in the holes made by the nails, and unless I put my hand into the gaping wound on his side, I will never put my trust in him."
