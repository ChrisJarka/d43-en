====== Micah 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter continues using poetic forms in communicating that people are guilty who take advantage of others.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Micah does not frequently explain the historical context of his prophecies. This may result in the translator's failure to understand implicit information unless they have a solid understanding of the time of Micah's ministry. It is therefore suggested that translators have a good understanding of the history of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])
