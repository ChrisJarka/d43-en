\c 5
\p
\v 1 And you, son of man, take you a sharp sword; as a barberâ€™s razor shall you take it to you, and shall cause
it to pass upon your head and upon your beard: then take you balances to weigh, and divide the hair.
\v 2 A third part shall you burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and you
shall take a third part, and strike with the sword round about it; and a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will
draw out a sword after them.
