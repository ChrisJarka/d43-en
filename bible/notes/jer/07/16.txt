\v 16 Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I
will not hear thee.
\v 17 Seest you not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\v 18 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of
heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
