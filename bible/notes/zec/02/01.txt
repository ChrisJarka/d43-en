\v 3 Then the angel who had been talking to me started to leave, and another angel walked toward him.
\v 4 That other angel said to him, "Run and tell that young man that some day there will be very many people and livestock in Jerusalem, with the result that they will not all be able to live inside the city walls; many will \add live outside\add* the walls.

\v 1 Then I looked up and saw a man with a surveyor's line.
\v 2 I asked him, "Where are you going?"
\p He replied, "I am going to survey Jerusalem, to determine how wide it is and how long it is."


\p
\v 3 Then the angel who had been talking to me started to leave, and another angel walked toward him.
\v 4 The second angel said to him, "Run and tell that young man with the surveyor's line: some day there will be very many people and livestock in Jerusalem, so they will not all be able to live inside the city walls; many will live outside the walls in the open country.
\v 5 Yahweh says that he himself will be like a wall of fire around the city, and he will be among the people with his glory."
