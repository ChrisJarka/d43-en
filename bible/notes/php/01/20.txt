===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 I \add know that this will happen\add* because I very confidently expect \f + \ft doublet \f* that in no way I will be reluctant \add to honor Christ\add*. Instead, just like I always \add have done\add*, Christ will be greatly honored \f + \ft Or:I will continue now also to very boldly honor Christ \f* by means of all that I do \f + \ft synecdoche, metonymy \f*, whether by \add the way I\add* live or \add by the way I\add* die.
\p
\v 21 As for me, I live \add in order to honor\add* Christ. But if I die, it will be better \add for me than if I continue to live, because then I will be completely united with him\add*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 I eagerly and confidently expect that in no way will I fail to do what I should do. Instead, I will have courage now, just as in the past. I will honor Christ with my body, whether I live or die.

\p
\v 21 As for me, I live to honor Christ. But if I die, it will be even better for me.

\v 20 It is my confident expectation and hope that I will not be ashamed. But with all courage, as always and especially right now, I will bring glory to Christ in my body, whether by life or by death.
\v 21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
</usfm>
