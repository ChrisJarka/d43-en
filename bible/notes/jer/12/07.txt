<usfm>
\q
\v 7 I have abandoned my house; I have forsaken my inheritance.
\q I have given my own beloved people into the hands of her enemies.
\q
\v 8 My inheritance has become to me like a lion in a thicket;
\q she sets herself against me with her own voice, so I hate her.
\q
\v 9 Has not my prized possession become a speckled bird, that other birds of prey go against her all around?
\q Go and gather all the wild beasts and bring them to devour her.
