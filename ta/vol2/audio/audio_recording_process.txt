===== The Process =====

//This answers the question:// //What is the process for recording?//

In the most simple terms, the process follows these steps:

  - The recordist presses the RECORD button in the software or on the device.
  - The narrator speaks a section of content into the mic.
  - The recordist presses the STOP button or similar function in the software or device.
  - The recordist plays the recorded section for the Checker and Narrator to review.
  - Depending on the decision of the Checker, the team may edit that recorded passage or they may begin recording the next section.

These steps are repeated over and over throughout a project. While these steps are described rather simply, it is important to remember there is a tremendous depth of engagement occurring creatively, relationally and sensory among the team during these steps.

Wise recordists quickly adopt the approach of “recording with editing in mind”. That is, recordists soon discover that //recording// is only the first part of a bigger process. The full process is made easier (or more difficult) because of decisions made during the recording step. In a sense, recording is simply capturing the sounds. But those sounds must come together into a meaningful, faithfully created representation of content, which requires editing. If you want editing to go well, do what wise recordists do and “record with editing in mind”.
