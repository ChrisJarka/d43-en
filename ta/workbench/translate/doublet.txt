This module answers the question: What is a doublet?

Figures of Speech 
 
Description 
We are using the word doublet to refer to two words or very short phrases that mean the same thing and that are used in the same phrase. Often they are joined with the word “and.” This is often used to emphasize or intensify the idea expressed by the two words.  
Reason this is a translation issue: In some languages people do not use doublets to emphasize or intensify the idea expressed by the two phrases. Or they may use doublets, but they may do it for a reason that would not fit in a particular verse. 
 
Examples from the Bible 
King David was old and advanced in years. 1 Kings 1:1  
This means that he was “very old.” 
he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself 1 Kings 2:32  
This means that they were “much more righteous” than he was. 
You have decided to prepare false and deceptive words Daniel 2:9  
This means that they had prepared “many false things to say”. 
as of a lamb without blemish and without spot. 1 Peter 1:19  
This means that he was like a lamb that had “no blemish at all”. 
 
Translation Strategies 
If your language uses doublets in order to emphasize or intensify an idea, consider using them. If not, consider these strategies. 
 
Translate only one of the phrases and add a word that intensifies it such as “very” or “great” or “many”. 
Use your own culture's way of emphasizing or intensifying a concept. 
 
Examples of Translation Strategies Applied

"You have decided to prepare many false things to say”. 
Use your own culture's way of emphasizing or intensifying the concept. 
a lamb without blemish and without spot. (1 Peter 1:19) English can emphasize this with "any" and "at all." 
"a lamb without any blemish at all"
