====== Metonymy [məˈtänəmē], Metonym [ˈmetəˌnim] ======

Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something associated with it. A metonym is a word or phrase used as a substitute for something it is associated with. 

===== Purposes of Metonymy =====


=====English Examples=====
"The pot is boiling" means "The water in the pot is boiling."\\ 
"The pen is mightier than the sword" means "Writing one's ideas and reasons is more effective than fighting."\\ 
"Could you give me a hand with this work?" means "Could you help me with this work?"

=====Examples from the Bible=====

//The Lord God will give him __the throne__ of his father, David.//  Luke 1:32 \\ 
A throne represents the authority of a king. Throne is a metonym for "kingly authority," "kingship" or, "reign". This means that God would make him become the king that was to follow King David. \\ 

//and he will reign over __the house of Jacob__ forever.// Luke 1:33a\\ 
The word "house" is often used in the Bible as a metonym for "household", the people living in the house. This too can be a metonym for descendants. So "the house of Jacob" in this verse refers to "Jacob's descendants". \\ 

//who warned you to flee from __the wrath__ to come?// Luke 3:7b\\ 
The word  "wrath" or "anger" is a metonym for "punishment." God was extremely angry with the people, and as a result, he would punish them.


=====Translation Suggestions=====
  * If a metonym is used in poetry or a sermon or some other kind of formal speech, use the metonym if the readers would be able to recognize what it refers to.
  * If the metonym is simply an idiom, or if it would be unclear to the readers, use the name of the thing the metonym refers to. (See [[en:ta:figures of speech:idiom|Idiom]])
