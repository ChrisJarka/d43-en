\v 8 Make sure that no one forces you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* to become his disciples \f + \ft metaphor \f* by his teaching you a religious philosophy\f + \ft Or: doctrine \f* that is valueless and false. Such a philosophy is false because it teaches what mere human beings think, because it teaches people elementary regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* \add that are concerned merely with what is external\f + \ft Or: physical \f*\add*, and because it teaches what is contrary to \add the true teaching about\add* Christ.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Watch out for anyone trying to force you into slavery to human religious traditions and false beliefs about the elements or the spirits  or "gods" of the earth and sky. People will try to convince you with empty and deceitful philosophy and "wisdom" to believe in nonsense instead of in Christ.
\v 9 All of God in his fullness lives in Jesus Christ, in his body, because Jesus lives in his body, and Jesus is God.
