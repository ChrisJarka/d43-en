\c 27
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Jehovah is my light and my salvation;
\q Whom shall I fear?
\q Jehovah is the strength of my life;
\q Of whom shall I be afraid?
\q
\v 2 When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh,
\q Even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
\q
\v 3 Though a host should encamp against me,
\q My heart shall not fear:
\q Though war should rise against me,
\q Even then will I be confident.
\q
\v 4 One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after:
\q That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life,
\q To behold the beauty of Jehovah,
\q And to inquire in his temple.
\q
\v 5 For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion:
\q In the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me;
\q He will lift me up upon a rock.
\q
\v 6 And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me;
\q And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy;
\q I will sing, yea, I will sing praises to Jehovah.
\b
\q
\v 7 Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry with my voice:
\q Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
\q
\v 8 When you saidst, Seek you my face; My heart said to thee,
\q Your face, Jehovah, will I seek.
\q
\v 9 Hide not your face from me;
\q Put not your servant away in anger:
\q You have been my help;
\q Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
\q
\v 10 When my father and my mother forsake me,
\q Then Jehovah will take me up.
\q
\v 11 Teach me your way, O Jehovah;
\q And lead me in a plain path,
\q Because of mine enemies.
\q
\v 12 Deliver me not over to the will of mine adversaries:
\q For false witnesses are risen up against me,
\q And such as breathe out cruelty.
\q
\v 13 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah
\q In the land of the living.
\q
\v 14 Wait for Jehovah:
\q Be strong, and let your heart take courage;
\q Yea, wait you for Jehovah.
