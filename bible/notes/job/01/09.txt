====== Job 01:9-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 9 Satan replied to Yahweh, "\add What you say is true\add*, but Job greatly respects you \add only\add* because of what \add you have done for him\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. \v 10 You have always \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* protected \f + \ft metaphor \f* him and his family and everything that he owns. You have made him very prosperous\f + \ft Or: rich \f*. He has very many livestock all over this land. \v 11 But if you take away \f + \ft metonymy \f* everything that he has, he will curse you openly. [IDI]" \p \v 12 Yahweh replied to Satan, "All right\f + \ft Or: Okay \f*, I will permit you to take away everything that he has. But do not harm him." \p Then Satan left, \add and he prepared to cause many disastrous things to happen to Job\add*. \p </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 9 Satan replied to Yahweh, "What you say is true, but Job honors you only because of what you have done for him. \v 10 You have always protected him, his family, and everything he owns. You make him succeed in whatever work he tries to do, and he has very much livestock all over his land. \v 11 But if you attacked what he owns and took it away, he would curse you in front of everyone." \p \v 12 Yahweh replied to Satan, "So this is what you want me to do! All right, I will permit you to take away everything that he has. But do not harm him in his own body." \p Satan agreed and then left Yahweh in order to plan how he would attack Job.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 9 Then Satan answered Yahweh and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? \v 10 Have you not made a hedge around him, around his house, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possession in the land have increased. \v 11 But put forth your hand now and attack all that he possesses, and he will renounce you to your face.” \v 12 Yahweh said to Satan, “See, all that he has is in your power; only do not lay your hand on his person.” So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Does Job fear God for nothing?</font>    **- "Does Job fear God for no reason?" Satan does not expect God to answer him. He is suggesting that Job obeys God only because God blesses him. (See: Rhetorical question)
  * **<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Have you not made a hedge around him, around his house, and around all that he has on every side?</font>    **- Again Satan does not expect God to answer him. He is stating the facts. This can also be written as a sentence : "You have protected him, his family and everything he owns." (See: Rhetorical question)
  * **made a hedge ****around him-**  "protected him" This phrase describes God surrounding Job with his protection like a hedge surrounds a field. (See: Metaphor)
  * **the work of his hands**  - "everything that he does"
  * **his possession in the land ****has increased **- "he has more and more livestock in the land" "Livestock" means cattle or sheep.
  * **<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>But put forth your hand now</font>    **- "But stretch out your hand now" God does not have a physical hand but this phrase compares God with a human being who would stick out his hand to prepare to attack another person. (See:Metonymy)
  * **<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>attack all that he posses</font>    ** **<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>ses -</font>    **"strike all that he owns" In the Hebrew, this phrase can be translated "touch your hand to all that he owns". See previous note. (See:Metonymy)
  * **he will renounce you to your face - **"he will reject you" "To your face" basically means "you". God does not have a face but Satan is saying that Job will clearly abandon God. (See: Metonymy)
  * **all that he has is in your power - **"You have power over all that he has" In the Hebrew, this phrase can be translated "all that he has is in your hand". Satan does not have a physical hand but he has been given control over everything that Job owns. (See: Metonymy)
  * **only do not lay your hand on his person - **"but do not harm him physically"
