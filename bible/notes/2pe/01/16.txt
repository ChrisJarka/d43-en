\v 16 We did not follow cleverly invented myths when we told you about the power and appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
\v 17 God the Father honored him and glorified him with a loud voice out of the majestic glory, "This is my beloved Son, I am well pleased by him."
\v 18 we heard this voice that came out of heaven. We were with him in the holy mountain.
