===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then it came to pass**  - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **in the eleventh year** - It is implied that this is the eleventh year after the Babylonians took king Jehoiachin to Babylon. Alternate translation: "in the eleventh year after the Babylonians took king Jehoiachin to Babylon." The people of Judah started counting their time in Babylon from the time the Babylonians took Jehoiachin to Babylon.
  * **in the first month** - It was understood that this was the first month of the eleventh year. Alternate translation: "in the first month of that year."
  * **The Word of Yahweh came to me and said** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]].
  * **broken the arm of Pharaoh**  - The "arm of Pharaoh" refers to the "power of Pharaoh. "broken the power of Pharaoh" or "broken the control of Pharaoh". Alternate translation: "I have taken away some of Pharaoh's power." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **Behold**  - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **It is not bound up to receive medicine and to set a bandage to bind it** - This phrase is used in reference to the metaphor of the broken arm. Pharaoh's power will not be restored.
  * **so it will be not be strong enough** - The "it" here is the broken arm. Because the wound will not be bandaged, it will not be healed and capable of grasping a sword.
