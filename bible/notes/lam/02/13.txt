<usfm>
\v 13 You people of Jerusalem \f + \ft metonymy, doublet \f*,
\q2 what can I\f + \ft Or: there is nothing that I can \f* say \add to help you\add*.
\q1 No people have \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* suffered like you are suffering;
\q2 I do not know what I can do to comfort you.
\q1 The disaster \f + \ft metaphor \f* that you have experienced is as great
\q2 as the ocean is deep;
\q2 there is no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* who can restore your \add city\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 14 The prophets among you claimed that they had seen visions \add from Yahweh\add*,
\q2 but what they said was false and worthless.
\q1 They did not save you from being exiled\f + \ft Or: forced to go to other countries \f*,
\q2 because they did not proclaim that you had sinned.
\q1 Instead, the messages that they gave you deceived you
\q2 because they were not true.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 You people of Jerusalem,
\q2 I cannot say anything to help you.
\q1 No people have suffered like you are suffering;
\q2 I do not know what I can do to comfort you.
\q1 You have fallen just as far
\q2 as if you had sunk in the ocean;
\q2 there is no one who can bring your city back to what it was.
\q1
\v 14 The prophets among you claimed that they had seen visions from Yahweh,
\q2 but what they said was false and worthless.
\q1 They did not work to save you from your enemies;
\q2 they did not tell you that you had sinned.
\q1 Instead, they announced to you things that they said Yahweh had told them;
\q2 they tempted you to believe them, and you did.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 What can I say to you, daughter of Jerusalem?
\q To what can I compare to you, that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion?
\q Your wound is as great as the sea. Who can heal you?
\q
\v 14 Your prophets have seen false and worthless visions for you.
\q They have not exposed your iniquity to restore your fortunes,
\q but for you they gave utterances that are false and misleading.
