==== Description ====

As part of a discourse  (Writing Styles) page that tells about things that are off-topic 

[[Should it be about all formatting signals, or just when they are used to tell about things that are off-topic?]]
 
 
The ULB and UDB use the following: \\  
**Long dashes** - for information that is immediately relevant to the rest of the passage and to separate a general topic from a statement about it that follows.  (We may need to ask Jim more about this. I'm not sure if these are two different uses or the same use described in two ways.) 

>Then two men will be in a field–one will be taken, and one will be left behind. Two women will be grinding with a mill–one will be taken, and one will be left. Therefore be on your guard, for you do not know on what day your Lord will come. (Matthew 24:40-41 ULB)
 
**Parentheses** - To show that some information is off-topic 


>Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place __(let the reader understand)__, 16let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out anything that is in his house, 18and let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak.  (Matthew 24:15-18 ULB)

Matthew wrote the book called Mathew. In Matthew he quoted what Jesus was saying.The words in the parentheses are not what Jesus was saying, but what Matthew was saying to the reader. 

>He appointed the Twelve (whom he named apostles), so that they might be with him and he might send them to preach, (Mark 3:14 ULB)

>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip and said, "Arise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This road is in a desert.) He arose and went. (Acts 8:26 ULB)
 
**Indentation** - To show that certain lines in poetry are parallel, or to show that a paragraph is quoted material.
