\v 12 Therefore I will do something terrible to you, Israel;
\q and because I will do something terrible to you,
\q prepare to meet your God, Israel!
\q
\v 13 For, look, he who forms the mountains
\q also creates the wind,
\q reveals his thoughts to mankind,
\q makes the morning darkness,
\q and treads on the high places of the Earth.
\q Yahweh, God of hosts, is his name."
