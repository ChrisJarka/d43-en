\v 12 Now I say this to the rest of you, \add to those who became believers after they were married. This is what\add* I \add am saying\add*, not what the Lord \add has commanded\add*. If someone has a wife who is not a believer, if she is willing to keep living with him, he must not divorce her.
\v 13 Similarly, if a woman has a husband who is not a believer, if he is willing to keep living with her, she must not divorce him.
\v 14 \add I say that\add* because God has set apart every woman's unbelieving husband \add for himself\add* because of his wife \add being a believer\add*, and God has set apart every man's unbelieving wife \add for himself\add* because of her husband \add being a believer\add*. If that were not true, \add God would consider\add* their children unacceptable. But, the fact is that \add God does consider\add* them acceptable to him.

\v 12 But to the those who have other relationships in marriage that are not so clear, and which the Lord does not address directly, I have this to say. This is not the Lord's command, but this is my counsel: If a Christian brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she is content to live with him, the rule is that he should not divorce her.
\v 13 Another situation is that of a Christian woman who is married to an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her. She should not divorce him.
\v 14 The unbelieving husband is set apart, he is taught and helped by the believing wife; and the unbelieving wife is sanctified, made better, and given the gift of the gospel, by the believing husband. If there were no benefit from just one believer in the family, your children would not be blessed by God. But they are. The children in these marriages are considered holy to the Lord, because they are the children of a parent who is a believer, and that one Christian parent brings blessings into the family.

\v 12 But to the rest I say (I, and not the Lord), that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she is content to live with him, he should not divorce her.
\v 13 And if a woman has an unbelieving husband and he is content to live with her, she should not divorce him. 
\v 14 For the non-Christian husband is given great gifts from God because of his believing wife, and God gives the non-Christian wife great gifts because of her Christian husband.  Otherwise your children would be unclean but now they are holy.
