\q
\v 15 This is the exultant city that lived without fear,
\q that said in her heart, "I am, and nothing is my equal."
\q How she has become a horror, a place for beasts to lie down in.
\q Everyone that passes by her will hiss and shake his fist at her.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In 2:4-15, Yahweh announces his judgment on the nations that surround Judah. 

  * **the exultant city** - "the city that is proud of itself." This refers to the city of Nineveh, about whom Yahweh began to speak in [[:en:bible:notes:zep:02:12|2:13]].
  * **said in her heart** - This idiom means "said to herself" or "she thought." The city is spoken of as if it were a person that could speak. It represents the people who live in that city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I am, and nothing is my equal** - It may be necessary to supply an object for "I am." AT: "I am the greatest city, and no other city is equal to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a horror** - "a horrible place to see"
  * **hiss and shake his fist** - A hiss is an angry sound. This phrase indicates extreme anger of the people toward Nineveh.
