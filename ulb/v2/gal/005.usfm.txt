\c 5
\p
\v 1 For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.
\p
\v 2 Behold, I Paul say to you, that, if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.
\v 3 Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
\v 4 You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you are fallen away from grace.
\v 5 For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.
\v 6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.
\v 7 You were running well; who hindered you that you should not obey the truth?
\v 8 This persuasion came not of him that calls you.
\v 9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
\v 10 I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that you will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear
his judgment, whoever he be.
\v 11 But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then has the stumbling block of the cross
been done away.
\v 12 I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.
\p
\v 13 For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through
love be servants one to another.
\v 14 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
\v 15 But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another.
\p
\v 16 But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and you shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
\v 17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other;
that you may not do the things that you would.
\v 18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
\v 19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
\v 20 idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,
\v 21 envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who
practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
\v 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
\v 23 meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.
\v 24 And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.
\p
\v 25 If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.
\v 26 Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
