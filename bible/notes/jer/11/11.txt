\v 11 So now I, Yahweh, am warning them that I will cause disasters to come to them, and they will not escape. And when they cry out for me \add to help them\add*, I will not pay attention.
\v 12 When that happens, the people in Jerusalem and other cities in Judah will \add offer sacrifices and\add* burn incense to their gods and ask for their help, but those gods will not be able to save them when those disasters come to them.
\v 13 There are more gods in Judah than there are towns in Judah, and the people of Jerusalem have erected as many altars to burn incense \add to those gods\add* as there are streets in Jerusalem.

\v 11 Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall
cry to me, but I will not listen to them.
\v 12 Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense:
but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
\v 13 For according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem
have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.
