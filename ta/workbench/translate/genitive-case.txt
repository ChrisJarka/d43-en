In common English, “possession” refers to having something, or to something that a person has. In grammar, **possession** refers to a grammatical relationship between two nouns. In English that grammatical relationship is shown with "of," or an apostrophe and the letter "s," or a possessive pronoun.

    * my mother -  the woman who gave birth to me, or the woman who cared for me
    * my teacher - the person who teaches me

  * Contents - Something has something in it.

=== Reasons this is a translation issue ===

  * Translators need to understand the relationship between two nouns when one possesses the other.
  * Some languages do not use possession for all of the situations that possession is used for in the source text of the the Bible.
