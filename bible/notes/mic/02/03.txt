\v 3 Therefore, this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "I will cause you people to experience disasters,
\q2 and you will not be able to escape \f + \ft metonymy \f* from them.
\q1 You will no longer walk around proudly,
\q2 because when that happens, it will be a time of much trouble for you.
\q1
\v 4 At that time, \add your enemies\add* will make fun of you;
\q2 they will ridicule you by singing this sad song:
\q1 'We are completely ruined;
\q2 Yahweh is taking our land\f + \ft Or: fields \f* from us,
\q1 and he will give it to those who will capture us.'~"
\q1
\v 5 So \add when it is the time for the land to be given back to you\add* people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 there will be no one \f + \ft metonymy \f* who will be able to cast lots\f + \ft Or: throw marked stones \f* to determine which land belongs to whom.

\q
\v 3 Therefore, Yahweh says,
\q"Look, I plan against this family a disaster,
\qFrom which you will not save your necks,
\qNeither will you walk arrogantly,
\qFor it is an evil time.
\q
\v 4 In that day they will use a parable against you,
\qAnd lament with a wailing lamentation,
\qAnd say, 'We are completely ruined,
\qHe changes the territory of my people.
\qHow can he remove it from me?
\qHe divides our fields to traitors!'"
\q
\v 5 Therefore, you will have none who divides the territory by lot
\qIn the assembly of Yahweh.
