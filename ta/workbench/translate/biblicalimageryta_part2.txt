Below are some common metonymies in the Bible. The images are listed in alphabetical order.

=== The idea of a CUP or bowl represents what is in it ===

> my cup runs over.  (Psalm 23:5 ULB)\\ 
There is so much in the cup that it runs over the top of the cup.

> For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.  (1 Corinthians 11:26 ULB)

People do not drink cups. They drink what is in the cup.

===The idea of a MOUTH represents speech or words ===

>A fool’s mouth is his ruin.  (Proverbs 18:7 ULB)

>Oh, how I would encourage you with my mouth!  (Job 16:5 ULB)

>I heard you when you boasted against me with your mouth; you said many things against me. I heard them. (Ezekiel 35:13 ULB)

In these examples the mouth refers to what a person says.

=== The idea of a PERSON represents people remembering his ancestor ===

>His roots will be dried up beneath;
>above will his branch be cut off.
>His memory will perish from the earth;
>he will have no name in the street. (Job 18:17 ULB)

This means that the wicked person will have no descendants for people to remember him by.

>Now Absalom, while still alive, had built for himself a large stone pillar in the King’s Valley, for he said, "__I have no son to carry along the memory of my name__." He named the pillar after his own name, so it is called Absalom’s Monument to this very day. (2 Samuel 18:18 ULB)

[[Jim, I see that people hoped that they would be remembered because of their descendants, but I don't think I found passages that really show a person representing the memory of his ancestor.]]

[[Jim, when a group of people is called by their ancestor's name, I wonder if that would be metonymy. A PERSON represents his descendants. This would be for when the names "Jacob" "Israel" "Judah" "Benjamin" etc refer to their descendants.]]

=== The idea of ONE PERSON represents many people ===

[[Jim, I added these examples. Are they the kind of thing you meant?]]

>For the wicked person boasts of his deepest desires;
>he blesses the greedy and insults Yahweh. (Psalm 10:3 ULB)

This does not refer to a particular wicked person, but to wicked people in general.

>Gad—raiders will attack him, but he will attack them at their heels.
>Asher's food will be rich, and he will provide royal delicacies.
>Naphtali is a doe let loose; he will have beautiful fawns. (Genesis 49:19-21 ULB)

The names Gad, Asher, and Naphtali refer not only to those men, but to their descendants.

>It came about that when Abram entered into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was very beautiful. (Genesis 12:14 ULB)

Here when it says "Abram" it represents Abram and all the people traveling with him.  \\  
[[Jim, is this right, or is it just that the story is focusing on Abram, and the fact that his wife and others went with him just is not mentioned?]]

=== The idea of PIERCING represents killing ===

> His hand pierced the fleeing serpent. (Job 26:13 ULB) \\ 
This means that he killed the serpent.

> Look, he is coming with the clouds; every eye will see him, including those who pierced him. (Revelation 1:7 ULB) \\ 
"Those who pierced him" refers to those who killed Jesus.

=== The idea of SINS represents punishment ===

>Yahweh has placed on him the iniquity of us all   (Isaiah 53:6 ULB) \\ 
This means that Yahweh placed on him the punishment that should have gone to all of us.

===The idea of WINE represents judgment ===

>But God is the judge;
>he brings one down and raises up another.
>For Yahweh holds a cup in his hand of foaming wine,
>which is mixed with spices, and pours it out.
>Surely all the wicked of the earth will drink it to the last drop. (Psalm 75:8 ULB)

>You have shown your people severe things;
>you have made us drink the wine of staggering. (Psalm 60:3 ULB)

>he also will drink the wine of God's wrath, the wine that has been prepared and poured unmixed into the cup of his anger. (Revelation 14:10 ULB)

Too much wine makes a person weak and he staggers. So too, when God judges people, they become weak and stagger. So the idea of wine is used to represent God's judgment.
