===== Description =====

The first time that people or things are mentioned in a story, they are __new participants__. After that whenever they are mentioned they are __old participants__.

**Now __there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus__... __This man__ came to Jesus at night time... Jesus replied to __him__** (John 3:1) - The first underlined phrase introduces Nicodemus as a new participant. He is then referred to as "This man" and "him" when he is an old participant.

**Reason this is a translation issue**: In order to make your translation clear and natural, it is necessary to properly mark the participants so people will know if they are new participants or ones that they have already read about.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**1. New Participants** \\ 
Sometimes a new participant is introduced with a phrase that says that he existed, such as "There was a man."  The phrase "There was" tells us that this man existed. The word "a" in "a man" tells us that that author is speaking about him for the first time.\\ 
  * **__There was a man__ from Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah.** (Judges 13:2) \\ 
    *  The rest of the sentence tells where this man was from, who is family was, and what his name was.

Sometimes a new participant is simply mentioned in relation to another person who was already introduced. \\
  * **There was a man from Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. __His wife__ was not able to become pregnant and so she had not given birth.** (Judges 13:2) \\
    * Manoah's wife is simply mentioned as "his wife". This phrase shows her relationship to him.

Sometimes a new participant is introduced simply by name because the author assumes that the readers know who the person is. \\
  * **The angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bochim, **(Judges 2:1)
    * The first time that the angel of Yahweh is mentioned in Judges, he is mentioned simply by his title.

**Old Participants** \\ 
A person who has already been brought into the story, may then be referred to with a pronoun, with a noun phrase, or by name or title.
  * **__His__ wife was not able to become pregnant and so __she__ had not given birth.** (Judges 13:2)
     * Here Manoah is referred to with the pronoun "his" and his wife is referred to with the pronoun "she".

  * **The angel of Yahweh appeared to __the woman__ and said to her,** (Judges 13:3) \\ 
    * Here Manoah's wife is referred to with the noun phrase "the woman".

  * **Then __Manoah__ prayed to Yahweh** \\ 
    * Here Manoah is referred to with his name.





  - In languages where the subject is marked in the verb, many languages do not mark old participants.  
===== Translation Strategies =====


===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

 1. In most languages new participants are introduced with a clause telling something about them.
  * ** There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai.** (Esther 2:6)
 2. After that in many languages the participant is referred to with a pronoun where it is clear who is being referred to.
  * **__He__ had been taken away from Jerusalem with the exiles** Since Mordecai had already been mentioned, he is referred to here with the pronoun "he".\\ 
 3. In languages where the subject is marked in the verb, many languages do not mark old participants.\\
  * This can not be illustrated with English because English does not mark the subject in the verb.
