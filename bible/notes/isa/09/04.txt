===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For the yoke of his burden, the beam across his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor is shattered** - The word "his" refers to the people of Judah. Isaiah compares the people, burdened by sin, to oxen wearing yokes and to slaves oppressed by their rulers. He describes the future freedom which the Lord will give to the people.  Isaiah refers to an event in the future as if it happened in the past in order to emphasize that the event will certainly happen.  Alternate translation: "The Lord will free the people of Judah from their burdens like a master who removes the yoke from his oxen or like a king who breaks an oppressor's rod." [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metaphor]] Notice the use of "his" in the ULB compared to the use of "us" and "our" in the UDB. (See [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:123person]])
  * **as on the day of Midian** - "as when the Lord used Gideon, a judge in Israel, to conquer the Midianites" (See:[[en:obe:other:gideon]] and [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]])
  * **every boot treading in the tumult and the garments rolled in blood will be burned, fuel for the fire** - The phrases "every boot" and "clothing covered with blood" may be metonymies for "every enemy soldier." Alternate translation: "The Lord will destroy all the enemy soldiers and their weapons of warfare and use them as fuel for his fire." (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metonymy]] and [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metaphor]])
