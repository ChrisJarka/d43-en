\v 24 So they said to each other, "Let's not tear it. Instead, let's \add decide\add* \add by\add* throwing lots\f + \ft Or: \add by\add* gambling \f* who will get it." So that is what the soldiers did. As a result, these words were fulfilled \f + \ft Or:they fulfilled these words \f* that \add the Psalmist had written\add* in Scripture,

\v 23 The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part;
and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
\v 24 They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might
be fulfilled, which saith,
\q They parted my garments among them,
\q And upon my vesture did they cast lots.
