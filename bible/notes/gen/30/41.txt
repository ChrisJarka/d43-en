\v 41 Whenever the stronger sheep in the flock were breeding, then Jacob laid the sticks in front of the eyes of the flock, in front of the watering troughs, so that they might conceive among the sticks.
\v 42 But when the feebler animals in the flock came, he did not  put the sticks before them. So the feebler animals were Laban’s, and the stronger were Jacob’s.
