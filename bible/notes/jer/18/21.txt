<usfm>
\v 21 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword; and let their wives
become childless, and widows; and let their men be slain of death,
and their young men struck of the sword in battle.
\v 22 Let a cry be heard from their houses, when you shall bring a troop suddenly upon them; for they have digged a pit to
take me, and hid snares for my feet.
\v 23 Yet, Jehovah, you know all their counsel against me to kill me; forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their
sin from your sight; but let them be overthrown before thee; deal you with them in the time of your anger.
