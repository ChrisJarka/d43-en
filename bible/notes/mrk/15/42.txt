\v 42 And when evening had come, because it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
\v 43 there came Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counselor, who was himself also looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
\v 44 And Pilate was amazed that he was already dead, and having called the centurion, he asked him if he had been dead long.
