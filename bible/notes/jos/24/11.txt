\v 11 Then you all crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho.

\v 12 I am the one who caused them to panic as you advanced and enabled you to defeat them, as I had enabled you to do earlier to the two kings of the groups who were descendants of Amor. You did not defeat them by using your own bows and arrows and swords; \add it was I who defeated them\add*.

\v 11 And you went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the
Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your
hand.
\v 12 And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your
sword, nor with your bow.
