===== Introduction to translationAcademy =====

//This page answers the question:// //What is translationAcademy?//

==== Welcome to translationAcademy ====

The “translationAcademy” is intended to enable anyone, anywhere to equip themselves so that they will be able to make high-quality translations of Biblical content into their own language. translationAcademy is designed to be highly flexible. It can be used in a systematic, in-advance approach or it can be used for just-in-time learning (or both, as needed). It is modular in structure. 

translationAcademy contains the following sections:
  * Introduction - introduces the unfoldingWord project (see [[en:ta:vol1:intro:toc_intro]])
  * Process Manual - answer the question "what next?" (see [[:en:ta:vol1:process:toc_processvol1_2]]) 
  * Translation Manual - explains the basics of translation theory and practical translation helps (see [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:toc_transvol1_2]])
  * Checking Manual - explains the basics of checking theory and best practices (see [[:en:ta:vol1:checking:toc_checkvol1_2]])
  * Technology Manual - explains how to use the different technology tools (see [[:en:ta:vol1:tech:toc_techvol1_2]])
  * Audio Manual - How to do high quality audio recordings (see [[:en:ta:vol2:audio:toc_audiovol2]])
  * Gateway Languages Manual - explains issues specific to the Gateway Languages (see [[:en:ta:vol3:gateway:toc_gatewayvol3]])

Several of the manuals are separated into two volumes. Volume 1 of each manual covers the basics of that subject while volume 2 goes more in depth. In general, if a module is needed to translate and publish Open Bible Stories, then it is included in volume 1, if not, then it is included in volume 2.
