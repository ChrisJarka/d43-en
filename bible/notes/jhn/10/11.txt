\v 11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
\v 12 He that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep,
and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scatters them:
\v 13 he fleeth because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
