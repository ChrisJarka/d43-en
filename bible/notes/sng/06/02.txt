===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My beloved has gone down to his garden** - The word "garden" is a metaphor for the woman. The man is finally able to fully enjoy the woman as they make love. See the explanation of this metaphor in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:05:01|5:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **beds of spices** - gardens or parts of gardens where people grow spices. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:05:13|5:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to graze in the garden and to gather lilies** - These words are metaphors for the man enjoying her body. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **graze** - "feeds" or "eats grass." The woman speaks of the man as if he were "a gazelle or a young stag" ([[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:16|2:17]]) that eats plants among the lilies. Grazing is probably a metaphor for lovemaking ([[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:01|2:1-2]]). See how you translated "he grazes" in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:16|2:16]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to gather lilies** - "to pick lilies"
  * **lilies** - sweet-smelling flowers that grow in places where there is much water. Translate as the plural of "lily" in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:01|2:1]].
  * **I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine** - See how "My beloved is mine, and I am his" is translated in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:16|2:16]].
  * **he grazes among the lilies with pleasure** - Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:16|2:16]].
