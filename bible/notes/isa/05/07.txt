===== Translation Notes: =====
This is the end of the parable about the vineyard. Now Isaiah is speaking.
  * **For the vineyard of Yahweh of Hosts is the house of Israel** - Alternate translation: "The people of Israel are like the vineyard of Yahweh, Lord of the angel armies."
  * **the men of Judah his pleasant planting** - Alternate translation: "the people of Judah are like the vines the farmer cared for."
  * **he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing**â€‹ - "Yahweh waited for the people to do what is fair, but instead they killed one another"
  * **for righteousness, but, instead, a cry for help** - This can be translated as a new sentence: "Yahweh waited for them to do what is right, but instead those who were weak cried out to me for help because those who were strong hurt them."
