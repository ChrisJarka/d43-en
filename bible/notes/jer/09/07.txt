\v 7 Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how
else should I do, because of the daughter of my people?
\v 8 Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceit: one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his
heart he lays wait for him.
\v 9 Shall I not visit them for these things? says Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
