Not all languages have “inclusive” pronouns. But translators for languages which have separate inclusive pronouns must always be careful whenever they read words like “we,” “us,” and “ours” in English, Hebrew, or Greek. They will always have to figure out whether they should use the pronoun that includes the person being spoken to or the pronoun that excludes the person being spoken to.

If a language has two sets of pronouns for “we,” “us,” and “our,” choosing the correct word requires a clear understanding of who is being referred to by the pronoun.

Inclusive pronouns refer to the speaker, the person(s) being spoken to and possibly others as well. These pronouns are called “inclusive” because, in addition to the speaker, they include the person(s) listening. For example: Dad said to his new friends, "We should join together for a hymn sing." "We" refers to those with Dad and the folks he is speaking to–it is an inclusive we.

Exclusive pronouns are those which refer only to the speaker and a select group of individuals–not those to whom the comments are addressed. For example: Dad said to his new friends, "We just came from a hymn sing." This "we" indicates that those with Dad have been to a hymn sing.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

This is not a problem for translators whose language also does not have inclusive pronouns. When a translator sees the word “us,” they can use the word for “us” in their own language.

But translators whose language has separate inclusive pronouns will always have to be careful whenever they read words like “we” “us” and “ours.” in English, Hebrew, or Greek. They will always have to figure out whether they should use the pronoun that includes the person being spoken to or the pronoun that excludes the person being spoken to.
