====== Verse Link Code ======

This page will guide you to creating links to verses in the Bible notes.

The generic code is as follows:

<code>
See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:bok:ch:vv|c:v]].
</code>

In the above example, the symbols to the left of the vertical bar (|) represent the URL of the target chunk. It must be entered exactly, including leading zeros:
  * bok = the three-letter code for the book
  * ch = the two-digit chapter number (except in Psalms, where it must be three digits)
  * vv = the two-digit verse number

The symbols to the right of the vertical bar (|) represent what appears in the visible green text in the note. I does not need leading zeros:
  * c = the chapter number
  * v = the verse number
