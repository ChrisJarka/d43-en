====== Nehemiah 08 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Reading of the Law ==

During the exile, the Hebrew language was no longer spoken. Only the priests and Levites still understood it. Ezra read the book of the law to the people in Hebrew and the Levites walked among the crowd translating it into Aramaic for the people to understand. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:priest]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]])

== Festival of Shelters ==

After they heard Ezra read the Law of Moses, the people obeyed it by making temporary shelters for themselves with tree branches. They did this to remember that their ancestors slept in shelters when they came out of slavery in Egypt.
