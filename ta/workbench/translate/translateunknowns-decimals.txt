====== Decimal Numbers ======

This module answers the question:  Why is there a mark between two numbers, such as 2.5? \\

The Bible contains many references to numbers of measures of volume and distance and other things. In the **ULB** these numbers are presented in the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek numbering systems as used in the Bible. In the **UDB** numbers are converted to the metric system of measures because that is the system most widely used in the world today. So, converting numbers to the metric system often results in parts of numbers that must be presented as decimals or fractions of whole numbers. This page explains the decimal numbering system used in the **UDB**. 

===== Description =====

The decimal point, or decimal comma, is a mark placed to the left of a number to show that the number refers to a part of a whole number. For example .1 meter is not a whole meter but is only one tenth of a meter. And .5 meter is not five meters, but is only five tenths of a meter. 3.7 meters is three and seven tenths of a meter.\\

In some countries people use a decimal point and in other countries people use a decimal comma. So people in countries that use a decimal comma would write “3.7 meters” as “3,7 meters.”\\

In some cultures people prefer fractions, another way of showing that a number refers to a part of a whole number. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])\\

The Biblical Volume, Biblical Weight, and Biblical Distance pages in Translation Academy list the standard volumes and weights used in the **ULB** and their metric equivalents found in the **UDB**. The conversion of Biblical measurements to metric measurements will often result in numbers that must be written as decimals or fractions:

==== Translation Principles  (optional) ====

===== Examples from the Bible =====

“Tell the people to make a sacred chest from acacia wood. It is to be one meter long, __0.7 meter wide__, and __0.7 meter__ high.” (Exodus 25:10 UDB)\\ 
“**They are to make an ark of acacia wood. Its length must be two and a half cubits; its width will be __one cubit and a half__; and its height will be __one cubit and a half__.**”  (Exodus 25:10 ULB)\\ 
Note: a cubit is 46 centimeters. See: [[en/obe/other/biblicaldistance|Biblical Distance]]

“With each bull also bring two liters of wine. With each male sheep, bring __1.2 liters__ of wine. With each lamb bring one liter of wine. These offerings must be brought on the first day of each month and burned completely on the altar.” (Numbers 28:14 UDB)\\
“**The people’s drink offerings must be half a hin of wine for a bull, a __third of a hin__ for a ram, and a fourth of a hin for a lamb. This is to be the burnt offering for every month throughout the months of the year.**” (Numbers 28:14 ULB)\\
Note: A hin is 3.7 liters. See: [[en/obe/other/biblicalvolume|Biblical Volume]]\\

"With each of the thirteen bulls, bring a flour offering of __5.7 liters__ of finely-ground flour mixed with olive oil. With each of the male sheep, bring __3.8 liters__." (Numbers 29:14 UDB)\\
“**You must offer with them a grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil, __three tenths of an ephah__ for every bull of the thirteen bulls, __two tenths__ for each ram of the two rams, …**” (Numbers 29:14 ULB)\\
Note: An ephah is 22 liters. See: [[en/obe/other/biblicalvolume|Biblical Volume]]

===== Translation Strategies =====

1. If decimal numbers are expressed in the ULB or UDB in natural way that will give the right meaning in your language, use either of those translations.

2. If decimal numbers are not expressed in the ULB or UDB in a natural way that will give the right meaning in your language, then translators will need to convert decimal numbers into whatever system your language uses for expressing numbers and parts of numbers, for example:\\
  * Decimals:    1.5 liters
  * Fractions:   1 ½ liters
  * Words:       one and one-half liters 

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. If decimal numbers are expressed in the ULB or UDB in a natural way that will give the right meaning in your language, use either of those translations.\\

    * “The next day that person must bring two male lambs and one female lamb; the female lamb must be one year old, and the animals must have no defects. He must also bring __about 6.5 liters__ of a fine flour offering, mixed with olive oil, to be an offering, and about one third liter of olive oil.”\\ (Leviticus 14:10 UDB)\\ 
    * “**On the eighth day he must take two male lambs without blemish, one female lamb a year old without blemish, and __three tenths of an ephah__ of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and one log of oil.**”\\ (Leviticus 14:10 ULB)\\

2. If decimal numbers are not expressed in the ULB or UDB in a natural way that will give the right meaning in your language, then translators will need to convert decimal numbers into whatever system your language uses for expressing numbers and parts of numbers, for example:\\
                * Decimals:    3.5 liters\\
                * Fractions:   3 ½ liters\\
                * Words:       three and one-half liters\\
 
      * “Someone must also provide each morning an offering of flour. It must be __about 3.5 liters__ of flour mixed with one liter of olive oil.” (Ezekiel 46:14 UDB)\\
    * “**And you will give a grain offering with it morning after morning, __a sixth of an ephah__ and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour of the grain offering for Yahweh, according to a permanent statute.**” (Ezekiel 46:14 ULB)
