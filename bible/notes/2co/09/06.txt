====== 2 Corinthians 09:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Do not forget this: "\add A farmer\add* who sows only a few \add seeds\add* will not gather\f + \ft Or: reap \f* a large \add harvest\add*, but the one who sows a lot \add of seeds\add* will gather\f + \ft Or: reap \f* a large \add harvest\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*." \add Similarly, if you give just a little to help others, God will give you only a few blessings. But if you give willingly and cheerfully to help people, you will receive in return many blessings from God\add*.
\v 7 Each of you should decide within yourself how much you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* should give, \add and then give that amount\add*. You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* should not \add be thinking to yourself\add*, "\add I really\add* do not want to give this money." \add And you\f + \ft singular \f* should\add* not give \add just\add* because someone tells \add you to give. Instead, you should give willingly and cheerfully\add*, because God loves those who give cheerfully.

\v 6 The point is, the one who sows very little seed will also have a small crop to harvest, and the one who sows a great amount will gather a great harvest.
\v 7 Give as you have decided in your heart—so when you give you will not regret it when you give away the money. No one should force you to give—God loves a person who is happy when they give.

\v 6 The point is this: the one that sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one that sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
\v 7 Let each one give as he has planned in his heart—not to cause you sorrow when you give, and not out of a compelling obligation—for God loves a cheerful giver.
