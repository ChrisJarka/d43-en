<usfm>
\v 4 because we have heard that you trust in Christ Jesus and that you love all those whom God has set apart for himself.
\v 5 You love our fellow believers because you confidently are waiting for the things God is reserving for you in heaven. You first heard about these things when you heard the true message, the Good News about Christ.
\v 6 This Good News that you heard in Colossae--believers are proclaiming it to everyone in the world. It is just as it has worked in you also, from the first day you heard it and understood how truly kind God is. The Good News is like a field planted with crops that are growing and will give much a very large harvest.

\v 5 because of the confident expectation reserved for you in the heavens. You first heard about this confident expectation in the word of truth, the gospel,
\v 6 which has come to you, as it also is bearing fruit and is growing in all the world, just as in you also, from the day you heard it and came to know the grace of God in truth.
