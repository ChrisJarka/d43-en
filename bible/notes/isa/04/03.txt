===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 3 All the people who will remain in Jerusalem, who did not die when the enemy destroyed Jerusalem, will belong to Yahwehâ€”all those whose names are listed among those who live there, \v 4 That will happen when Yahweh washes away the guilt of the women of Jerusalem, and when he stops the violence on the streets of Jerusalem by punishing the people of Jerusalem. When he does that, it will be like a fire to burn up all the impure things. \v 5 Then Yahweh will send a cloud of smoke during the days and a flaming fire during the nights to cover Jerusalem and all those who gather there; it will be like a glorious canopy over the city. \v 6 It will shelter the people from the sun during the daytime and protect them when there are windstorms and rain. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 3 Then, he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, will be called holy, every one who is recorded as living in Jerusalem, \v 4 when the Lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and will have cleansed the blood stains from Jerusalem's midst, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning fire.

\v 5 Then Yahweh will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her place of assembly, cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; a canopy over all the glory. \v 6 It will be a shelter for shade in the daytime from the heat, and a refuge and a cover from the storm and rain. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem**  - The Hebrews often repeated things in different words as a way of emphasis. Alternate translation: "whoever remains in Jerusalem." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **will be called holy**  - This can be translated with an active clause: "Yahweh will call them holy" or "will belong to God" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:translate:active|Active or Passive]])
  * **who is recorded**  - This refers to a book or scroll where someone writes down all the names of the people who live in the city.
  * **will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and will have cleansed the blood stains from Jerusalem's midst**  - This compares moral sins with physical dirt that one washes away with water. It can be translated as "will have removed the sins of the women of Jerusalem, and will have taken away those in Jerusalem who harm innocent people." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning fire**  - This can be translated as a new sentence. "And the Lord will do this with his spirit that judges fairly and like a fire will purify the people."
