\v 8 So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree became known,  many young women were taken to Susa
under the protection of Hegai. Esther was taken into the king’s harem also, to the care  of Hegai, guardian
of the women.
\v 9 The  young woman pleased him, and she found favor with him. He quickly provided her with cosmetics and provisions of food,
and the seven young women from the  king’s palace, and advanced  her and her chosen young women
to the best place in the harem..
