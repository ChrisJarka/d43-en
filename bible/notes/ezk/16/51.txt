\v 51 Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have
justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done.
\v 52 You also, bear you your own shame, in that you have given judgment for your sisters; through your sins that you have
committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than you: yea, be you also confounded, and bear your shame, in
that you have justified your sisters.
