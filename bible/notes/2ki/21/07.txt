\v 7 He placed the statue of the goddess Asherah in the temple, the place about which Yahweh had said to David and his son Solomon, "My temple will be here in Jerusalem. This is the city that I have chosen from all the territory of the twelve tribes of Israel, where I want people to worship me, forever.
\v 8 And if the Israelite people obey all my commands and all the laws that I gave to Moses, the man who served me \add very well\add*, I will not again force them to leave this land that I gave to their ancestors."
\v 9 But the people did not heed Yahweh. And Manasseh persuaded them to commit sins that are more evil than the sins that were committed by the people of the nations that Yahweh had expelled from the land as the Israelite people advanced.

\v 7 The carved figure of Asherah, which he had made, he set in the house about which Yahweh said to David and  Solomon his son, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever.
\v 8 I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if they will only be careful to act according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the Law that my servant Moses commanded them."
\v 9 But the people did not listen, and Manasseh tempted them to do what was evil even more than the nations that Yahweh had destroyed before the children of Israel.
