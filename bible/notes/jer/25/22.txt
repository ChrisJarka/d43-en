===== translationNotes: =====

Jeremiah continues to list all the nations that were under God's judgement. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

  * **the sea** - This is a reference to the Mediterranean Sea.
  * **the ones who cut the hair on the sides of their heads** - This is likely a reference to Arabians who lived in the desert.
