====== Possession ======

===== Description =====

This module answers the question: What is possession?

Possession refers to a special relationship between two nouns, when one noun belongs to, or defines, or describes the other noun in some way. The English language often shows possession with the word “of,” as in, “the love __of__ God,” or by using an apostrophe and the letter “s,” as in, “God__’s__ love,” which can mean the love that God possesses. However, a relationship between nouns can have several other meanings that this page will describe.

**Definition**: Possession literally refers to the relationship between two nouns in which one owns the other. Also, possession may refer to the close relationship two nouns can have with each other, and the various ways those nouns can be related and the meanings that can result.

=== Reason this could be a translation issue ===

When two nouns are connected by the word “of” in the Bible, as in “the love of God,” the meaning can be unclear. Does “the love of God” refer to God’s love for us, or to our love for God, or to something else? This page seeks to provide help with how to translate phrases where two nouns are joined by “of” in the Bible.

=== Translation Principles ===

The list below explains the possible special relationships between two nouns that could apply in a passage you are translating. Use this information to help you determine how best to translate related nouns, which occur very often in the Bible.

Seek to understand the relationship of the nouns in the original context, and work to make sure your translation makes that relationship clear. The context should clarify which possible meaning from below is actually meant.

One noun (or pronoun) can be related to another noun (or pronoun) in several different ways, as described below. These verse quotations are from the ULB, and then they are retranslated to describe the meaning.
  - **Description**: when the noun after “of” describes the other noun\\ Mark 1:4 - “a baptism __of repentance__,” meaning, “a repentance __kind of__ baptism,”
  - **Ownership**: when the noun after “of” owns the other noun\\ Ephesians 3:1 - “the prisoner __of Jesus Christ__,” meaning, “the prisoner who __belongs to__ Jesus Christ”
  - **Identity**: when the noun after “of” has the same identity as the other noun\\ Acts 10:45 - “the gift __of the Holy Spirit__,” meaning, “the gift __which is__ the Holy Spirit” 
  - **Subject**: when the noun after “of” produces or causes the other noun\\ 2 Corinthians 5:14 - “the love __of Christ__,” could mean, “the love that Christ __produces__”\\ Christ would be the subject who produces the love.\\ Acts 12:11 - “the expectation of the people __of the Jews__,” meaning, “the expectation that the Jews __caused__”\\
  - **Object**: when the noun after “of” is the object of the action done by the other noun\\ 2 Corinthians 5:14 - “the love __of Christ__,” could mean, “the love __for__ Christ”\\ Christ would be the object who receives love from those who love him.\\ Matthew 12:31 - “blasphemy __against the Spirit__,” meaning, the Spirit is the __object__ of blasphemy\\
  - **Whole**: when the noun/pronoun after “of” is a group in which the other noun/pronoun is a part\\ Ephesians 4:7 - “To __each one of us__ has been given a gift ”—“each one” refers to the parts of the whole group, and the whole group is “us”


===== Examples from the Bible =====

**1.**  Which sort of possession described above would you say “kingdom of heaven” is in the verse below? Which translation below makes the most sense in this context?

“But Jesus said, ‘Permit the little children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for the **kingdom of heaven** belongs to such ones.’” (Matthew 19:14 ULB)\\    
In this context, what meaning of “kingdom of heaven” seems to be the intended meaning?
  - **Description**: the heaven __kind of__ kingdom?		     
  - **Ownership**:   the kingdom that __belongs to__ heaven?          
  - **Identity**:    the kingdom which __is__ heaven?
  - **Subject**:     the kingdom __produced by__ heaven?	             
  - **Object**:      the kingdom which __produces__ heaven?	     
  - **Whole**:       the kingdom which is __a part of__ heaven?       
Which category above would you say best fits the meaning of the Biblical phrase, “kingdom of heaven”?  Can you explain why you chose the meaning above that you chose?

**2.**  In Ephesians 6:17 there are three examples of two related nouns. Which category of meaning above would you say best fits each of these? Each phrase may be different from the others (or, the same). 
“And take the **helmet of salvation**, and the **sword of the Spirit**, which is the **word of God**” (Ephesians 6:17 ULB)
