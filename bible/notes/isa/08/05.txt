===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Because this people have refused the gentle waters of Shiloah** - Water was collected into a pool at Shiloah. This water was moved from Shiloah to Jerusalem through a narrow trough. These gentle, flowing waters are compared to the teachings of the Lord that were always available to lead the people of Jerusalem. It can be translated as "Because this people have rejected Yahweh's help which is like the gentle waters of Shiloah." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]] and [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]])
  * **and are happy over Rezin and Remaliah’s son** - See how you translated these names in [[en:bible:notes:isa:07:01|7:1]]. The full meaning can be made explicit: "and are happy that the armies of Assyria have defeated Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, Remaliah's son, king of Israel." (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **therefore the Lord is** - Yahweh is still speaking. He refers to himself as "the Lord." Alternate translation: "therefore I am."
  *  **up on them** - "up on the people of Judah" 
  * **the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory** - The Lord compares the army of Assyria to a mighty river. This emphasizes the power of the army from Assyria. Alternate translation: "the army from Assyria that is powerful like a mighty river."
  * **It will come up over all its channels and overflow its banks** - "There will be so many soldiers it will be like a river flooding over its banks"
