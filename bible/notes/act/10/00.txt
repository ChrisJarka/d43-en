=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "The Gentiles also had received the word of God" ==
In the early church, its members were almost exclusively Jewish. Then, the Gentiles started to believe in Jesus. This is what it means that to "receive the word of God." This was criticized by many Jews at first.

== "Baptism in the Holy Spirit" ==

Many scholars believe that this indicates the Spirit began to indwell, or live inside their heart in order to guide them when they believed in Jesus. Others believe that this gave the ability to speak in tongues in addition to indwelling them and is an event that occurs after salvation.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Get up, Peter; kill and eat!" ==
Peter's vision was about Christians being allowed to eat any animal. The Jews were not permitted to eat many animals because the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]] declared that they were [[:en:obe:kt:unclean|unclean]]. Before this vision, the Christians were not certain whether they needed to follow the Law of Moses. The presence of the Holy Spirit is an indication that the Gentiles could be saved without following the Law of Moses.
