====== Key Terms: Pages to Edit - temp ======

~~NOCACHE~~

The Key Terms in table below are ready to be edited by the Key Terms Team.

  * **New Terms**  - These terms have little or no content. They are divided into two columns and assigned to either Group A or Group B. Adding initial content to these terms should be the first priority for the team each week.
  * **Draft Terms**  - These terms are nearing completion. Both groups should review these terms and make final changes or comments.

Because of the volume of terms, they KT team is divided into two groups so that each group can focus on creating initial content for a portion of the "New" terms each week. After that, the whole team works together to complete the editing of the "Draft" terms.
