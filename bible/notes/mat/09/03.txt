\v 3 Some of the men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws said among themselves, "\add He claims that he can forgive sins! That means that he claims to be equal with God\add*! He is insulting God!"
\v 4 Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, "You should not think evil \add thoughts\add*, \add accusing me because I claim that I am God\add*!\f + \ft Or: Why do you think evil \add thoughts\add*, \add saying that it is wrong for me to claim that I am God\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 5 It would \add not\add* be risky \add for someone\add* to say \add to this man\add*, '\add I\add* forgive your sins', \add because no one could see whether or not it really happened\add*. But \add no one, without having the power to heal\add*, would say \add to him\add*, '\add Get\add* up and walk!', \add because people could easily see whether it happened or not!\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 6 \add So I am going to do something\add* in order that you may know that \add God\add* has authorized \add me\add*, the one who came from heaven, to forgive the sins \add of people while I am\add* on the earth, \add as well as to heal people\add*." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, pick up your sleeping pad, and go home!"

\v 3 Some of the men who taught the Jewish laws said among themselves, "This man thinks he is God; he can't forgive sins!"
\v 4 Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he said, "You should not think evil thoughts about me!
\v 5 It would not be hard for someone to say to this man, 'I forgive your sins,' because no one could see whether or not it really happened. But no one would say to him, 'Get up and walk!,' because people could easily see whether he could walk again!
\v 6 So I am going to do something in order that you may know that God has authorized me, the Son of Man, to forgive the sins of people while I am on the earth." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, pick up your sleeping pad, and go home!"

\v 3 Behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, "This man is blaspheming."
\v 4 Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?
\v 5 For which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven' or to say 'Get up and walk?'
\v 6 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins', he said to the paralytic, 
'Get up, pick up your mat, and go to your house.'"

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus' healing a paralyzed man.

  * "**This man is blaspheming God."**  - the scribes thought that only God could forgive sins and did not believe that Jesus was God.
  * **Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?**  - this means "your thoughts are evil." Jesus used this question to point out that the scribes were the ones who were evil. (See: rhetorical questions)
  * **you thinking evil in your hearts **- this could be translated "the thoughts in your mind are evil" or "your thoughts evil." (see idioms)
  * **which is easier to say**  - Jesus used a rhetorical question to make the Scribes think about his power.
  * **Your sins are forgiven**  - this can be stated as "I forgive your sins". (UDB) (See Active)
  * **that you may know **- this "you" refers to the scribes.
