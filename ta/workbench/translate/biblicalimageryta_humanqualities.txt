==== Translation Strategies ==== 
If the image would give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, see the strategies in [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] or [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]].

A simile keeps the same association of concepts. Changing a metaphor to a simile works because it weakens the associated link to the two ideas to the point that the readers will accept it. You're preparing the readers to an association be tween to concepts that would be difficult to understand or accept.
