====== winnow, sift ======

===== Definition: =====

To winnow means to separate grain from the unwanted chaff by tossing them into the air and allowing the wind to blow the chaff away. The word "sift" refers to shaking the winnowed grain in a sieve to separate any remaining unwanted materials, such as dirt or stones, from the grain.

  * In the Bible, the process of winnowing grain is used figuratively to describe God bringing hardship to separate the righteous people from the unrighteous people.
  * The word "sift" is used in a similar figurative way of separating the righteous people from the unrighteous. For example God said, "I will sift the house of Israelâ€¦as grain is sifted in a sieve".
  * One time, Jesus used the term "sift" to refer to Satan desiring to bring hardship to the disciples in order to shake them from their faith. It is implied that this would reveal those who would abandon their faith in the face of suffering, separating them from those who would persevere in believing.
