\v 4 One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth remains for ever.
\v 5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goes down, and hastens to its place where it ariseth.
\v 6 The wind goes toward the south, and turns about to the north; it turns about continually in its course, and the
wind returns again to its circuits.
