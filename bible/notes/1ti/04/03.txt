====== 1 Timothy 04:3-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 \add For example\add*, they forbid that \add believers\add* marry \add because they say that it makes us unacceptable to God\add*. They also \add command\add* that people abstain from \add eating certain\add* foods. But God created such foods in order that we can eat them! We who believe \add in Christ\add* know the true \add teaching\add*, and we thank \add God for the food that he gives us. That is why we\add* can eat it.
\v 4 \add We can eat all kinds of food\add* because God has created all \add food\add*, and it is all good. We should not refuse to eat certain kinds of food if we thank \add God for it\add* when we eat it.
\v 5 It is acceptable \add to God\add* because God \add long ago\add* said \add that all things that he made are good\add*, and because we pray that God will bless it.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 They will try to stop marriages. They will say not to eat certain foods that God created for people who know and believe the truth to share with thanksgiving
\v 4 because everything made by God is good and we hate nothing that we receive with thanksgiving,
\v 5 because what we set apart through the word of God and prayer is holy.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3They will forbid to marry and to receive foods that God created for sharing with thanksgiving among believers who came to know the truth.
\v 4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing that we take with thanksgiving is rejected,
\v 5 since it is consecrated through the word of God and prayer.
