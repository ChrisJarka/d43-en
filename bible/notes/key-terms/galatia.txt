====== Galatia ======

===== Facts: =====

Galatia was a large region located in the eastern part of Asia Minor.

  * Paul addressed the letter of Galatians to churches in Galatia.
  * The churches at Galatia were Gentile Christian churches that were being influenced by Jewish Christians to keep some of the Jewish laws. That is the reason Paul wrote his letter, which is the Book of Galatians in the New Testament.
