\v 1 Moreover Elihu answered and said,
\q
\v 2 Thinkest you this to be your right,
\q Or say thou, My righteousness is more than Godâ€™s,
\q
\v 3 That you sayest, What advantage will it be to thee?
\q And, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?
\q
\v 4 I will answer thee,
\q And your companions with thee.
\q
\v 5 Look to the heavens, and see;
\q And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.
\q
\v 6 If you have sinned, what effectest you against him?
\q And if your transgressions be multiplied, what do you to him?
\q
\v 7 If you be righteous, what give you him?
\q Or what receiveth he of your hand?
\q
\v 8 Your wickedness may hurt a man as you art;
\q And your righteousness may profit a son of man.
\b
\q
\v 9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;
\q They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
\q
\v 10 But none saith, Where is God my Maker,
\q Who gives songs in the night,
\q
\v 11 Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth,
\q And makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?
\q
\v 12 There they cry, but none gives answer,
\q Because of the pride of evil men.
\q
\v 13 Surely God will not hear an empty cry,
\q Neither will the Almighty regard it.
\q
\v 14 How much less when you say you behold him not,
\q The cause is before him, and you waitest for him!
\q
\v 15 But now, because he has not visited in his anger,
\q Neither does he greatly regard arrogance;
\q
\v 16 Therefore does Job open his mouth in vanity;
\q He multiplies words without knowledge.
