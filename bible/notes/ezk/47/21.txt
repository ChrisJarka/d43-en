\v 21 So shall you divide this land to you according to the tribes of Israel.
\v 22 And it shall come to pass, that you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you and to the strangers that sojourn
among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall be to you as the home-born among the children of Israel; they
shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
\v 23 And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall you give him his inheritance, says the
Lord Jehovah.
