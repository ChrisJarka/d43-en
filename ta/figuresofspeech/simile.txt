====== Simile ======

Watch the video for the [[http://youtu.be/ylwbrp-vVgI|computer]] or the [[http://youtu.be/LQdDDn-d_ak|tablet/phone]].

In a simile something is compared to something else of a different kind in order to focus on a particular trait that they have in common. The fact that there is a comparison is stated clearly with ‘like’ or ‘as’. The thing that is being talked about is the "topic." The thing it is compared to is the "image." The trait that they have in common is the "point of similarity."

Purposes of Simile

  * One purpose of simile is to teach about something that is unknown by indicating that it is similar to something that is already known.
  * Another purpose is to emphasize that something has a particular trait or to indicate that it has that particular trait in an extreme way.
  * Similes also help you to form a picture in your mind of something; to experience what you are reading about more fully.

===== Examples from English =====

**"He is __as crooked as a dog's hind leg__."** \\ Someone might say this about a businessman who is dishonest. English speakers associate truth with being straight and dishonesty with crookedness.

**"She was __as cool as a cucumber__".**  \\ Someone might say this about a person who doesn't get emotional in a very stressful situation. English speakers associate emotion with heat and lack of emotion with coolness.

**"I slept __like a log__."** \\ Someone might say this if they slept very well without waking during the night." Logs don't move, and a person who sleeps very well isn't aware of moving around while sleeping.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**How often I wanted to gather your children together, __as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings__, but you refused!**  Luke 13:34b \\ In this simile, Jesus compared the protection he wanted to give the people of Jerusalem to the kind of protection a hen gives to her chicks when they are in danger. It's not that he would literally gather the people, but he would protect them and they would trust him.

**For as the lightning flashes in one part of the sky and shines to the other part of the sky, so will it be when the Son of Man comes in his day.**  Luke 17:24 \\ Jesus did not say how his coming back to earth would be like when lightning flashes. But we can understand from the rest of the text that just as lighting flashes suddenly and everyone can see it, he will come suddenly and everyone will be able to see him. No one will have to be told about it.

**For you know how as a father treats his children, we exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you, to walk worthy of God,**  1 Thes 2:11, 12a \\ In this example of simile, Paul compares his behavior to that of a father. He was not the father of the Thessalonian Christians, they were not children, and he was not raising them in his home. But he was loving and gentle toward them as he taught them just as a father is loving and gentle toward his children as he teaches them.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * If the image in the original is unknown to your people, use one from your own culture. Be sure that it is one that could have been used in the cultures of the Bible. We don't want to have comparisons to things that had not been invented when the books of the Bible were first written.
  * Or if the image in the original is unknown to your people, simply state the point of similarity without using an image.
  * If it would be unclear to your readers how the topic is like the image, you can state the point of similarity explicitly. However, do not do this if it was not clear to the original audience.
