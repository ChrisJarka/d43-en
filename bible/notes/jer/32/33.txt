\v 33 My people have turned away from me and have refused to return to me. Even though I taught them things many times, they would not pay attention to what I taught them, and they would not obey me.
\v 34 They have set up their detestable idols even in my own \f + \ft metonymy \f* temple and defiled it\f + \ft Or: caused it become a place that is unacceptable for people to worship me \f*.
\v 35 They have built shrines to \add honor\add* Baal in Ben-Hinnom Valley \add outside Jerusalem\add*, and there they sacrifice their sons and daughters to their god Molech. I never commanded them to do such horrible deeds. I never even thought that anyone might do such a terrible thing. And by doing it they have caused all the people of Judah to \add be guilty of having\add* sinned."

\v 33 They turned the back of their neck to me instead of their faces, though I taught them eagerly. I taught, but not one of them listened to receive correction.
\v 34 Then they set their detestable things in the house where my name was called in order to defile it!
\v 35 Next they built high places of Baal in the valley of Ben-Hinnom in order to pass their sons and daughters before Molech, which I did not command them 
and did not even rise in my heart for them to do this abomination in order to make Judah sin.
