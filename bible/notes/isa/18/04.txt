<usfm> \v 4 Listen because Yahweh has told me this: \q1 "I will watch quietly from where I live. \q2 I will watch as quietly as the heat that shimmers as it rises on days during the summer, as quietly as the dew forms on the ground during harvest time." \q1 \v 5 But even before the army of Ethiopia starts to attack, \q2 while their plans are slowly forming like grapes that are ripening, \q1 Yahweh will get rid of them like a farmer who cuts off the new shoots of the grapevines with his shears, \q2 who prunes the branches that have become very long.

<usfm> \p \q1 \v 4 This is what Yahweh said to me, "I will quietly observe from my dwelling-place, \q1 like the simmering heat in sunshine, like a cloud of mist in the heat of harvest." \q1 \v 5 Before the harvest, when the blossoming is over, and the flower is ripening into a grape, \q1 he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches. </usfm>
