\v 36 Again Yahweh spoke to Moses and said,
\v 37 "Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest and telll him to take up the censers out of the smoldering remains and scatter the fire, for they are holy.
\v 38 Take the censers of these sinners against their own lives. Let them be made into beaten plates for a covering over the altar, for they offered them before Yahweh, therefore they are holy. They will be a sign to the people of Israel.
