{{:en:obs:obs-44-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

A crowd of people quickly came to see the man who was **[[:en:obe:other:heal|healed]]**. **[[:en:obe:other:peter|Peter]]** said to them, â€œWhy are you amazed that this man is healed? We did not heal him through our own power or goodness. Rather, it is the **[[:en:obe:kt:power|power]]** of **[[:en:obe:kt:jesus|Jesus]]** and the **[[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]]** that Jesus gives that healed this man."
