====== Capitalization ======

We are going to follow the 2011 NIV as a guide to new-style English capitalization. The reason for this is a combination of modern style and the fact that the lavish use of capitals in older Bible versions is not used in any of the other languages into which our text and notes will be translated. 

Here are the general principles:

  - This style does not capitalize words such as temple, scripture, etc.
  - We are also not capitalizing divine personal pronouns such as he, you, etc. 
  - Any title or proper name of a person or place will be capitalized

==== Examples ====

^  Capitalized  ^  Uncapitalized  ^
|  * one\\ 
  * two|
|others|


Bible\ scripture\ word of God (scripture)\ Word of God (Jesus)\ Christian\ God's Law\ the Law of God\ the Law of Moses\ King of the Jews\ Sabbath\ synagogue\ Ten Commandments\ good news (gospel)\ gospel\ kingdom of God\ kingdom of Israel\ New Covenant\ Exile\ Promised Land\ Tent of Meeting\ temple\
