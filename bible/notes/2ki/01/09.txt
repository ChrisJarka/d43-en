\v 10 Elijah answered and said to the captain, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men." Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then the king sent a captain with fifty soldiers to Elijah** - The king sent the leader of the army with fifty men to bring Elijah back to him. AT: "Then the king sent a captain with fifty soldiers to seize Elijah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **fifty soldiers** - "50 soldiers" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **If I am a man of God, let fire** - Here Elijah speaks a command in the form of a conditional clause, the condition being "if he is a man of God." It is known that he is man of God, therefore, what he is commanding will happen. This can be written without the conditional clause. AT: "I am a man of God, therefore, let fire" or "I am a man of God, so I command that fire" 
  * **heaven** - "the sky" (UDB)
