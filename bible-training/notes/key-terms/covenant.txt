A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that they must fulfill.

    * This agreement can be between individuals, between groups of people, or between God and people.
    * When people make a covenant with each other, they say that they will do something, and they must do it.
    * Examples of covenants include marriage covenants, business agreements, and treaties between countries.
    * On several occasions, God made a covenant with his people. 
    * In some of the covenants, God promised to fulfill his part without conditions.
