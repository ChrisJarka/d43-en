<usfm> \v 8 Then I saw a raised part all around the house. The foundation of the side chambers were a full stick – six cubits to each joint. \v 9 The width of the wall for the side-chamber on the outside – five cubits. And that is what was left of the house: side chambers that were for the house. </usfm>
