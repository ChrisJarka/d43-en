\v 5 Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward
the north, and behold, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
\v 6 And he said to me, Son of man, see you what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit
here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you shall again see yet other great abominations.
