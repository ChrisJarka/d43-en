\v 18 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk,
and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water
the valley of Shittim.
\v 19 Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the children of Judah,
because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
