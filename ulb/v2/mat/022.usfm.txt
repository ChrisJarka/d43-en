\v 1 And Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,
\v 2 The kingdom of heaven is likened to a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,
\v 3 and sent forth his servants to call them that were commanded to the marriage feast: and they would not come.
\v 4 Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen and my
fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.
\v 5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise;
\v 6 and the rest laid hold on his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.
\v 7 But the king was wroth; and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
\v 8 Then says he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were commanded were not worthy.
\v 9 Go you therefore to the partings of the highways, and as many as you shall find, command to the marriage feast.
\v 10 And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and
the wedding was filled with guests.
\v 11 But when the king came in to behold the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment:
\v 12 and he says to him, Friend, how came you in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.
\v 13 Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the
weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
\v 14 For many are called, but few chosen.
\p
\v 15 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might ensnare him in
his talk.
\v 16 And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are true, and teachest the
way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for you regard not the person of men.
\v 17 Tell us therefore, What think thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
\v 18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why make you trial of me, you hypocrites?
\v 19 Show me the tribute money. And they brought to him a denarius.
\v 20 And he says to them, Whose is this image and superscription?
\v 21 They say to him, Caesar’s. Then says he to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and to
God the things that are God’s.
\v 22 And when they heard it, they marvelled, and left him, and went away.
\p
\v 23 On that day there came to him Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him,
\v 24 saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to
his brother.
\v 25 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife to his
brother;
\v 26 in like manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh.
\v 27 And after them all, the woman died.
\v 28 In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
\v 29 But Jesus answered and said to them, You do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
\v 30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.
\v 31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
\v 32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not
the God of the dead, but of the living.
\v 33 And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
\p
\v 34 But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together.
\v 35 And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, trying him:
\v 36 Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?
\v 37 And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.
\v 38 This is the great and first commandment.
\v 39 And a second like to it is this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
\v 40 On these two commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets.
\p
\v 41 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,
\v 42 saying, What think you of the Christ? whose son is he? They say to him,
The son of David.
\v 43 He says to them, How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,
\q
\v 44 The Lord said to my Lord,
\q Sit you on my right hand,
\q Till I put your enemies underneath your feet?
\m
\v 45 If David then calls him Lord, how is he his son?
\v 46 And no one was able to answer him a word, neither dared any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
