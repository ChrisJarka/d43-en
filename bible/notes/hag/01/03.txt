\v 3 Then came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
\v 4 Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your ceiled houses, while this house lies waste?
\v 5 Now therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.
\v 6 You have sown much, and bring in little; you eat, but you have not enough; you drink, but you are not filled with drink; you clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.
