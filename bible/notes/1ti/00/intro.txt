=== What is the Book of 1 Timothy about? ===

This is one of four letters from Paul that are addressed to a person instead of a church. The other three letters are 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon.  1 Timothy contains a lot of instruction on church worship (2:1-15), qualifications for church leaders (3:1-13), and warnings against false teachers (1:3-11, 4:1-5, 6:2-5).  This reflects how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches.  1 Timothy contains many principles that can help church leaders in our day to manage the ministry of the local church.

=== Who wrote the Book of 1 Timothy? ===

The book of 1 Timothy is a letter written from the Apostle Paul to his disciple Timothy.  1 Timothy was probably written around 62-64 years after the birth of Christ.  This would have been near the end of Paulâ€™s life.  Paul had a close relationship with Timothy and referred to him as a son several times (Phil. 2:22, 1 Tim 1:2, 1:18).
