\v 28 It is not those who perform rituals  \add to show they are God's people\add* who are  \add true\add* Jews, and it is not being circumcised in their bodies  \add that causes God to accept them\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 29 On the contrary, we whom  \add God has changed\add* inwardly are  \add true\add* Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*. And  \add God has accepted us because we have allowed God's\add* Spirit to change our hearts, not because we perform rituals. Even if  \add other\add* people will not praise us, God will praise us.

\v 28 It is not those who perform rituals for God who are true Jews, and it is not being circumcised in their bodies that causes God to accept them.
\v 29 On the contrary, we whom God has changed inwardly are the true Jews. God has accepted us because we have allowed God's Spirit to change our hearts, not because we perform rituals. Even if  other people will not praise us, God will praise us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 For he is not a Jew who is merely one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is merely outward in the flesh.
\v 29 But he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter. The praise of such a person comes not from people but from God.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For **– “we can conclude then, based on the preceding statement"
  * **outwardly **- This refers to Jewish rituals which people can see.
  * **outward **- This is the physical evidence on his genitals that a man has received circumcision.
  * <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>** inwardly  ** – This refers to the values and motivations of the person whom God has transformed.</font>
  * <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>** in the spirit, not in the letter  ** – “Letter” does not mean an "epistle" here. Rather, it refers to the smallest part of written language; the whole Scripture is made up of many Hebrew letters. (See: Synecdoche). Proposed translation: “through the work of the Holy Spirit, not because of the fact that you know the Scriptures.”</font>
  * **praise**  - On judgment day, God will commend people who obeyed him, whether they were circumcised or not.
