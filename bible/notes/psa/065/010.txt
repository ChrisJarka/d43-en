\q
\v 10 You water its furrows abundantly;
\q you settle down the furrows' ridges;
\q you make them soft with rain showers;
\q you bless the sprouts between them.

\v 11 You crown the year with your goodness;
\q the tracks behind your chariot drop fatness down to the earth.
\q

\q and the hills are clothed with joy.
