  * **Meshelemiah ... Zechariah** - Translate the names of these men the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:09:20|1 Chronicles 9:21]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Kore** - Translate this man's name the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:09:17|1 Chronicles 9:19]].  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Asaph** - This is an alternative spelling to "Ebiasaph" in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:09:17|1 Chronicles 9:19]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
