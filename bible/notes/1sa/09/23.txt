\v 23 And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said to thee, Set it by thee.
\v 24 And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And
Samuel said, Behold, that which has been reserved! set it before you and eat; because to the appointed time has
it been kept for thee, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
