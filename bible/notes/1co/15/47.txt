\v 47 The first man, Adam, was from the earth, made from the dust. But the second man, Christ, came from heaven.
\v 48 Just as Adam was made from the dust, so are all those who come from him are made from the dust. Just as Christ, the man of heaven, those who are from heaven are made like him.
\v 49 Just as we have been made in the image of the man of dust, so we will also bear the image of the man of heaven.
