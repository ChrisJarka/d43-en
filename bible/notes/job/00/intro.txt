=== What is Job about? ===

Job tells of the reality that earthly blessings do not always come to those who worship Yahweh. God permits trials and loss to come into the lives of those who worship him. There reason for suffering or sorrow may be unknown to those suffering. The book explains that the reason for Job's sorrows and  loss are more about trusting in the character of Yahweh and finding peace regardless of one's circumstance.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). The name "Job" is not related to the word "job" meaning an occupation or career. One possible title is "The book about Job."

=== Who wrote Job? ===

The author of Job is not known. Many suggest that Moses composed or compiled the book, but this conclusion is uncertain.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Does [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] cause suffering? ===

While sin does cause suffering, this does not mean that sin causes a person's suffering. It was commonly held in the ancient Near East that a person suffered because of some sin in their life or in the lives of their parents. Many religions teach that their [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]] bless the [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteous]] and punish the [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]].

=== When does the book of Job take place? ===

The exact date of the events of Job is unknown. It is likely that Job lived before Moses. Because of this, very little is known for certain about the religious and cultural context of the book. Many cultures have stories similar to Job because of the desire to know why the righteous suffer.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What style of writing is Job? ===

While the beginning and end of Job mostly contain narrative, there is a large portion of poetry in the book. The beginning and end may be a formal introduction and conclusion to the book (known as a prologue and epilogue). Hebrew poetry is not overly concerned with words rhyming and instead typically has one phrase reflect, describe, or expand on the meaning and focus of a previous phrase or section. There are many examples of this kind of poetry in ancient middle-east languages. The book is not concerned with producing a precise historical narrative because the lessons of the book are timeless.

=== How do I translate the term "friends?" ===

While the ULB uses the term "friends" in reference to Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, this is somewhat of a misnomer.  Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar were not really Job's friends. Instead, they tempted Job and gave his bad advise. Another word choice may be better.  

=== Is Job difficult to translate? ===

Because Job is not connected with a specific historical context, the translator may wish to translate this book before other Old Testament books. The original language of the book of Job is unknown and there are many unique words and phrase within the book. The translator should be aware that this causes the book to be very difficult to translate and may therefore be better left to a time near the end of translating the Old Testament.
