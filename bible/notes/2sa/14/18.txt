\v 18 Then the king answered and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, anything that I shall ask thee. And the woman
said, Let my lord the king now speak.
\v 19 And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman answered and said, As your soul liveth, my
lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant
Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid;
\v 20 to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of
an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
