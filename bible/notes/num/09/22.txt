\v 22 Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, living thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
\v 23 At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed: they kept the charge of Jehovah, at the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.
