\c 15
\p
\v 1 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues,
which are the last, for in them is finished the wrath of God.
\p
\v 2 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his
image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God.
\v 3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,
\pi Great and marvelous are your works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are your ways, you King of the ages.
\v 4 Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify your name? for you only are holy; for all the nations shall come and worship
before thee; for your righteous acts have been made manifest.
\p
\v 5 And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:
\v 6 and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with
precious stone, pure and bright, and wrapped about their breasts with golden girdles.
\v 7 And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives
for ever and ever.
\v 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the
temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.
