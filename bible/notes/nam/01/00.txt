====== Nahum 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers and songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of the entire book (except for verse 1 of this chapter) because they are poetic prophecy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

Despite being divided into three chapters, this book consists of one long prophecy. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Yahweh's anger on Nineveh ==
This prophecy should be read alongside of the book of Jonah. The evil of the Ninevites would be punished by God, but only after he had used them for his own purposes. These actions of Yahweh, although described as vengeance or anger, do not have the same connotations as they do with humans. Therefore, Yahweh is not sinful. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:evil]], [[:en:obe:kt:avenge]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

== Complete destruction ==
At that time, Assyria controlled almost the entire Near East. Nahum prophesied that the Assyrians would be so completely destroyed as a nation that they would no longer even be a people group. This prophecy came true and did so very suddenly.
