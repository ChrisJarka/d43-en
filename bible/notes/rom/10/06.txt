\v 6 But those whose record of sins God has erased as a result of their believing in Christ can say to anyone as Moses said, “You should not critically say inwardly, ‘Someone will have to go up and enter heaven!'" That is to say, someone will have to  go up and bring Christ down  to bring the message of salvation to us!
\v 7 "Or  you should not say inwardly, 'Someone will have to go down and enter the place where the spirits of dead persons are!" That is to say, someone will have to  go down and bring Christ up from there to bring the message of salvation to us. You should not say that because Christ has already come down to save us, and has already risen from the dead!
