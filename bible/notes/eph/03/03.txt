\v 3 God revealed to me the mystery of the Good News that he had not revealed as clearly to others. When you read what I have already written briefly about that,
\v 4 you will be able to understand that I understand clearly the mystery of the Good News about Christ.
\v 5 Formerly, God did not fully reveal the Good News that was to come to anyone. It was like a secret message, a mystery, that no one completely understood, but now his Spirit has revealed the Good News to his apostles and prophets who are set apart for God and who tell God's messages.

\v 3 God made known to me the revelation of  this mystery, which I wrote a little about previously in this letter.
\v 4 When you read about this you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,
\v 5 which in other generations was not made known to the human family, as it has now been revealed to his apostles and prophets set apart for God by his Spirit.
