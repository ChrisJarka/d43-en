====== Door43 Editors ======

There are two built-in editors in Door43:

  * DW Edit
  * CKG Edit

We have found that both editors have some issues with different browsers. DW Edit can be finicky with Internet Explorer. In general, they both tend to work better on Firefox.


==== DW Edit ====

DW Edit is a "plain text editor." â€“ This is the most basic DokuWiki editor, and it provides full control over the syntax of the text. Go to the [[en:ta:workbench:tech:door43:syntax|Formatting Text]] page for some simple editing formats to use in the text editor.


==== CKG Edit ====

CKG Edit is a "visual" or "WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get")" editor.

When you click the "Edit this page" button, this editor is the default version that will normally load. The edit window looks like a simplified word processor. Click [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFK1zK_dSYc|here]] for the "how to" 1 minute video. The buttons take care of formatting text and generally make it easier to use. Here is information on the toolbar icons: [[doku>toolbar|quickbuttons]].


==== Which Editor to Use? ====

By default, Door43 pages will open to CKG Edit. If you have trouble using CKG Edit, you may want to switch to DW Edit. DW Edit is easier for some people, and it may prevent you from introducing errors in the code for the page. However, you will need to know a bit of code in order to insert bullets or text formatting.

==== How to Switch Editors ====

When you are in the Edit mode for a page, a button will appear to the right of the "Save" button with the option to switch to the other editor. If you are working in "GKG Edit," the button will say "DW Edit." If you are working in "DW Edit," the button will say "CKG Edit."
