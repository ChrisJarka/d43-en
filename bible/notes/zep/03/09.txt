\v 9 For then will I turn to the peoples of a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with
one consent.
\v 10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.
\v 11 In that day shall you not be put to shame for all your doings, wherein you have transgressed against me; for then I will
take away out of the midst of you your proudly exulting ones, and you shall no more be haughty in my holy mountain.
