===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he has pity on** - AT: "he feels very sad for"
  * **the poor and needy** - Here the words "poor" and "needy" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that they are unable to help themselves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **oppression and violence** - These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize how badly the needy suffer. AT: "those who oppress them and hurt them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **their blood** - AT: "their lives" or "their suffering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **precious in his sight** - AT: "precious to him." This does not mean he likes to see their blood, but that their suffering feels like a precious loss. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
