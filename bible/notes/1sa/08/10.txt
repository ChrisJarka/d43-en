\v 10 And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah to the people that asked of him a king.
\v 11 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them to
him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;
\v 12 and he will appoint them to him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and
he will set some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments
of his chariots.
