\v 24 They answered Joshua and said, "Because we heard that Yahweh your God commanded his
servant Moses to give you all the land, and to kill all the people of the land.  We were 
terrified and feared for our lives because of you.  That is why we have done this.
\v 25 Now, we are in your hand.  Do whatever seems good and right for you to do to us."
