\v 26 And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death:
but I will not at this time put you to death, because you barest the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and
because you was afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
\v 27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah, that he might fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he spoke
concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
