\c 23
\p
\v 1 The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
\v 3 and they played the harlot in Egypt; they played the harlot in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there
was handled the bosom of their virginity.
\v 4 And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bare sons and
daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.
