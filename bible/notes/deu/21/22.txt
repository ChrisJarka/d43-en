\v 22 If someone is executed for having committed a crime for which he deserves to die, and you hang his corpse on a post,
\v 23 you must not allow his corpse to remain there all night. You must bury it on the day that he died, because if you keep the corpse on a post, God will curse the land. \add You must bury the corpse that day\add*, in order that you do not defile the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you."

\v 22 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and you hang him on a tree;
\v 23 his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that you defile not your land which Jehovah your God gives you for an inheritance.
