=== What is the Book of Joel about? ===

The major theme of Joel is the “day of Yahweh. This expression is found five times in Joel (1:15; 2:1; 11, 21; and 3:14); this phrase is also found in thirteen places in Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos, Obadiah, Zephaniah, and Malachi. This “day” is the time when Yahweh will judge and punish his people, and also the other nations. The time will come when Yahweh will end to the rebellion and sin of his people and of all the nations.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

"The Book of Joel" may also be called the "The book about Joel" or "The sayings of Joel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). 

=== Who wrote the Book of Joel? ===

The prophecies in this book are messages given by Yahweh to Joel, son of Pethuel, who is otherwise unknown to us. It was traditionally thought that Joel lived in the time of the northern and southern kingdoms, perhaps during the reign of King Joash of Judah in the second part of the seventh century BC. However, most scholars today think that Joel probably lived in post-exilic times, after the Jews had returned to Judah from Babylonia.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is the meaning of the locust attacks in Joel 1 and 2, and of the drought in Joel 2? ===

It was common for farmers in the Ancient Near East to experience massive locust attacks, in millions of these insects would come and eat all crops in their fields. Joel might be describing such attacks in the first two chapters. On the other hand, his description might instead be a picture of the enemy invaders who Joel prophesied would come and destroy everything. 

In the same manner, the drought (severe lack of rain) that Joel describes might be a real drought, or it might be a picture of either enemy invaders or of Yahweh himself coming to punish his people and the other nations.

Translators should translate simply, presenting the scenes of locusts and drought as Joel describes them, and not worry about the various possible meanings.
