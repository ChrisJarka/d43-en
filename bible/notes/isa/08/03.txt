===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I went to the prophetess** - This means Isaiah had sex with her. Some languages use less direct phrases such as “I slept with the prophetess” or “I went to bed with the prophetess.” It can also be stated explicitly that Isaiah is married to the prophetess: "I slept with my wife, the prophetess." (See: [[en:ta:translate:euphemism]] and [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **the prophetess** - a female prophet
  * **Call his name** - "Give him the name"
  * **Maher-shalal-hash-baz** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:08:01|8:1]].
  * **For before the child knows to cry** - "Because before the child can say"
  * **the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria** - Alternate translation: "The king of Assyria will carry away all the treasures of Damascus and Samaria." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
