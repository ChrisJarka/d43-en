\v 5 And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt,they are mine. Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine even as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
\v 6 The children you have  after them, shall be yours; they shall be listed under the  the names of their brothers in their inheritance.
\v 7 But  as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, some distance to come to Ephrath' and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is Beth-lehem)."
