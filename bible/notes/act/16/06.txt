\v 6 Paul and his companions went through the regions of Phrygia and Galatia, since they had been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in the province of Asia.
\v 7 When they came near Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus prevented them.
\v 8 So passing by Mysia, they came down to the city of Troas.
