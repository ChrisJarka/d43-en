===What is Amos about?===

Amos began his work about 744 to 750 BC. He prophesied against the [[:en:obe:kt:evil|wicked]] ways of the kingdom of Israel even though it was prospering. Yahweh called Amos to leave his home in Judah and go to Israel. He had no authority or credentials, but he spoke against the wickedness of Israel.
Yahweh gave Amos the “judgment oracles” found in the first six chapters of the book. Amos preached these oracles. Each of them begins with the phrase, “This is what Yahweh says …” (ULB). There are two groupings of these oracles (according to their content). The last part of Amos has three visions of coming judgment. The final vision promises both destruction and the hope of redemption, see Amos 9:11-15, the “booth of David” would be rebuilt (meaning the Davidic monarchy would be restored). 

===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Amos" may also be called the "The book about Amos" or "The sayings of Amos."


===Who wrote Amos?===

It is likely that Amos wrote this book. Amos came from a poor family—from farmers and herdsmen. They grew sycamore trees (known as sycamore fig trees to most—a food for the poorest), and he may have had cows (based on the description of him in 7:14, 15), and he was a shepherd (see 1:1). Though Amos was a farmer, he demonstrates a very thorough knowledge, even extensive understanding of the Law of Moses, but he was not formally trained. There is no record another prophet ordaining him. Amos is one of the most elegant and masterful of the prophets but it is unknown how long he functioned as a prophet.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
===What is social justice?===

A major focus of Amos's ministry is on  [[:en:obe:kt:justice|justice]]. A godly society or community was to be just. Amos describes this as fair treatment of the poor, helping orphans and widows and obeying Yahweh. Amos explains that Yahweh would rather the people act justly rather than sacrifice to him. This is true obedience to the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]].

===What is a lawsuit?===
Many cultures have a process for resolving disputes through the use of courts. These legal disputes are called lawsuits. There is a lot of legal terms in Amos and part of the book follows the events of a courtroom. The people are introduced, the problem is explained, the people are examined, witness speak and a judgment is given.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the meaning of the term "Israel"? ===

The name “Israel” is used in many different ways in the Bible. The descendants of Jacob, who was also named Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel. This people group developed into the unified nation of Israel. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, while the southern kingdom became known as the Kingdom of Judah. In Amos, "Israel" almost exclusively refers to the northern kingdom of Israel.

===Where do narrative sequences begin and end?===
The structure of the book of Amos has caused a lot of confusion for translators. There are times when Amos's thoughts do not appear to logically flow from one verse to the next. It may be helpful to solve these issues with carefully divided lines or paragraphs. The translator has the freedom to begin a new paragraph or line, even if it is in the middle of a verse.
