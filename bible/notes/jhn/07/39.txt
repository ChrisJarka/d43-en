===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 39 He said this about the Spirit, whom the Father was going to give those who trusted in him. God had not yet not sent the Spirit to live within believers in this way, because Jesus had not yet finished his work, completed all he had to do, and proclaimed his victory and power.
