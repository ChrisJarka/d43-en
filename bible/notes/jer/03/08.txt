\v 8 The people of Judah saw what I did to them. But they are just like the people of Israel. They are not afraid \add of what I will do to them\add*. They also \add have turned away from me and are worshiping idols like\add* women who abandon their husbands and go to other men \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 9 They thought that worshiping idols did not matter to me, so they have made the entire land unacceptable to me by worshiping idols of wood and stone.
\v 10 The people of Judah have pretended to return to me, but they have not really done that. \add This is true because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it."

\v 8 So I saw that for all these reasons that she committed adultery. Apostate Israel! I sent her out and gave her a decree of divorce. But her treasonous sister Judah did not fear, and went and she also played the whore!
\v 9 The noise of your whoredom came and defiled the land, so they idolized the stone and the tree.
\v 10 Then with all of this, her treasonous sister Judah also did not return to me with all her heart, but with a lie!—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
