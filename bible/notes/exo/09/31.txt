===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom**. -  The storm happened at  the time of year that these grains are easily damaged.
  * **wheat and the spelt were not harmed**  - These grains were not at a critical growth stage when the storm happened because they grow and are harvested later in the season than the other grains.
