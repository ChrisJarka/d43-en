\v 8 But Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away. "Stand, stand", they cry; but none looks back.
\v 9 Take the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.
\v 10 She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melts, and the knees strike together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale.
