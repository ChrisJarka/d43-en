===== translationNotes: =====


  * **You have turned my mourning into dancing** - People would dance when they were very happy. AT: "You have caused me to stop mourning and to dance with joy instead." 
  * **you have removed my sackcloth** - "sackcloth" was associated with mourning and sorrow. AT: "You have caused me to no longer be sad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **clothed me with gladness** - The psalmist speaks of gladness as if it were a garment that he could put on. AT: "caused me to be glad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **So now my glory will sing praise to you** - Many versions, including the UDB, interpret "my glory" to mean the heart of the Psalmist, who is honored to be able to worship God. AT: "So now I am honored to sing praise to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
