====== All Text Included ======

Sometimes there are differences in verse numbering between translations, or sometimes certain verses are put in footnotes. Ask the following questions to see how the translator handled these situations:

Q? Does the translation include all the verses of the book that was translated? (When you look at the verse numbering of the national language translation, are all of the verses included in your language translation?)

Q? Are there places in the translation where something seems to be left out, or there seems to be a different message than is found in the national language translation? (Other than the wording, does the language that the translator used give the same message as the national language translation?)
