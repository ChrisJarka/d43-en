===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Neither did they see what Yahweh did - **  Moses continues, as in verse 2, using a negative statement to emphasize the positive. The people of Israel he is addressing now, did see (positive), God's following actions. (See: Double Negatives)
  * **Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab - **  Moses is refering to what is described in Numbers chapter 16. On that occasion Korah, a Levite, was jealous of the position and authority given to Moses by God. So, Korah conspired with Dathan and Abiram to divide Israel's loyalty to their God-given leader Moses. God took the lives of the conspirators by opening up the earth so that it swallowed them alive.
  * **earth opened its mouth**  - "ground opened up" In this case the earth is compared to a person who can open its mouth and swallow. (See: Personification)
