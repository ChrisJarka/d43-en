\v 9 As for our being happy because God has erased the record of our sins, it is not something that only we Jews can experience. No, it is also something that non-Jewscan experience. What is written in the Scriptures, that it was because Abraham trusted in God that the record of his sins was erased  shows that this is true.
\v 10 Think about when God erased the record of Abraham's sins. It happened before he was circumcised, not after he was circumcised.

\v 9 Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? For we say,  "Faith was counted to Abraham for righteousness."
\v 10 How then was it counted? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? It was not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
