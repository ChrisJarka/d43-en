====== Revelation 09 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter continues the seven trumpet judgments. This chapter and the previous one form a single unit.

== Woe ==
There are several specific "woes" mention in the book of Revelation. This chapter contains the first of these woes. It is possible that these have some structural significance or importance to the chronology of the events of Revelation.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Animal imagery ==
Animal imagery is common in this book as well as very common in this chapter. It is probable that the people of the ancient Near East viewed these animals as having some "trait," which typified the animal. For example, a lion is often seen as powerful.  The translator should not try to determine the meaning of each of these images. 

== Bottomless pit ==
This is a common image in the book of Revelation to describe [[:en:obe:kt:hell|hell]]. It emphasizes that hell is inescapable. It is described as being down, in opposition to heaven which is considered up. This emphasizes that they are not on earth.

== Abaddon and Apollyon ==

These are words in Hebrew and Greek. John does not "translate" these words but chooses to "transliterate" by substituting Greek letters for the Hebrew letters. The translators of the ULB and UDB have not translated the meaning of these words. The translator should try to form the sounds of these words without translating their meaning.

== Repentance ==
This chapter mentions the theme of [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]]. Despite these great miracles, the people are said to avoid repentance and remain in their [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]]. One should not lose sight of this theme when reading the book of Revelation.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
[[:en:obe:kt:satan|Satan]] is often described as a fallen angel. Since stars are an image for angels in the book of Revelation, the phrase "a star from heaven that had fallen" is probably a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]] for Satan.

== Simile ==
There are many [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|similes]] in this chapter. Their purpose is to describe the complex image that John sees in his vision. Therefore it serve more of a practical rather than poetic function.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "The people who did not have the seal of God" ==
It is best to leave the meaning of this phrase unclear in translation, if possible. Many scholars believe it to be a mark made to distinguish [[:en:obe:kt:believe|believers]] from unbelievers in this time of tribulation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
