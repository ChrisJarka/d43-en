===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Mary continues to praise God:)
  * **lowly** - That is, "unimportant" or, "ordinary" or, "simple" or, "poor". Mary did not have high social standing.
  * **paid attention** - That is, "thought about" or, "remembered." It can also be translated as, "did not forget." It's not an issue of God's ability to remember, but his choosing to remember.
  * **from now on** - That is, “now and in the future.”
  * **all generations** - That is, "people in every future generation" or, "people living in all times" as in the UDB.
  * **the Mighty One** - This refers to God. It can also be translated as, "God, the Powerful One."
  * **his name** - That is, "he".
