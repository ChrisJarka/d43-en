\v 18 And others are the ones sown among the thorns. They hear the word,
\v 19 but the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires of other things, enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
\v 20 And those are the ones sown in the good soil. Who hear the word and receive it and produce fruit; some thirty, and some sixty, and some a hundred."
