\v 9 I am praying for them. I am not praying for those who are belong to this rebellious and fallen world. I am praying for those you gave me because they belong to you.
\v 10 All I have belongs to you, and all you have is mine. These people declare who I am and they prove what I do.
\v 11 I am not staying in the world any longer, but they are staying in the world. I am coming to you, Holy Father, help them by your strength to honor your name -- that name that you gave to me -- so they may be one, as we are one.

\v 9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom you have given me; for they are thine:
\v 10 and all things that are mine are your, and your are mine: and I am glorified in them.
\v 11 And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in your name which
you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.
