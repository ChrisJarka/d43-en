===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The gloom will be dispelled from her who is in anguish** -  The previous chapter described the people of Judah as living in the dark. The word "gloom" means "partial or total darkness."  (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]]) The word "dispel" means "to take away" or "to remove." Alternate translation: "The Lord will remove suffering and pain from the kingdom of Judah." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **gloom** -  See how you translated this word in [[en:bible:notes:isa:08:21|08:22]].  
  * **from her who is in anguish** - "from her who is in intense pain" The word "her" refers to the kingdom of Judah. 
  * **The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who have lived in the land of the shadow of death, the light has shone on them.**  - Here the verb tense shifts from the future to the past tense.  Often in prophecy things that will happen in the future are described as happening in the past.  This emphasizes that these things will certainly happen.  Judah's suffering, resulting from her sin, is compared to living in a land of darkness, shadow, and death.  Her future obedience to God is compared to living in great light and bright sunshine.  Alternate translation: "A light will shine on those who now live in the land of shadow and death" (See [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])  These two sentences express the same meaning. (See [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
