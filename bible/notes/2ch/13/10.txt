\v 10 But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and
we have priests ministering to Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:
\v 11 and they burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense: the bread of the presence also
set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening:
for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but you have forsaken him.
