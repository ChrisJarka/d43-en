===== The Coordinator =====

This module answers the question: What does the Coordinator do?\\
==  ==

The coordinator handles many of the responsibilities of bringing a recording project together. This role could be fulfilled by a person with no other responsibilities or, in many cases, might be handled by the Recordist.

Aspects of a project that need coordinating include identifying and arranging for the recording location, logistics for the team members involved in the project (lodging, transportation, meals), ensuring needed funding is obtained and is being dispersed appropriately, ensuring needed equipment is available, planning and activity involved in communicating the need for narrators/checkers/recordists. Also involves making sure the source text is up to date and made available to the team in the right format(s).

The coordinator would also be part of formulating a project plan, including time span, costs, special travel needs for team members (visas, etc.) The assumption is that the content being recorded is CC BY-SA and therefore licensing concerns are not an issue requiring coordination.
