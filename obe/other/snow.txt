===== Facts: =====

The term "snow" refers to frozen flakes of precipitation that fall in high places such as mountains or in areas of the world that are far north or far south.

  * Snow falls occasionally in Jerusalem in the winter but does not normally accumulate.
  * The whiteness of snow is symbolic of purity. Scripture states that "though our sins are as scarlet they shall be as white as snow."
  * The visions of the glorified Christ in the book of Revelation state that his hair was "white like snow." Snow is often used as an example of the color white.
