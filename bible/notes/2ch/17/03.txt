\v 3 Yahweh helped Jehoshaphat because in his earlier years, when he first began his rule, he did the things that pleased Yahweh just as his ancestor King David had done. Jehoshaphat did not worship Baal.
\v 4 Instead, he sought advice from the God whom his father had worshiped, and he obeyed God's commands and he did not do the evil things that the kings of Israel kept doing.
