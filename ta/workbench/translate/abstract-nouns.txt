===== Description =====

Remember that nouns are words that refer to a person, place, thing, or idea. **ABSTRACT NOUNS** are nouns that refer to things that cannot be seen, heard, tasted, smelled or touched in a physical sense. Ideas and things like 'peace' are real, but cannot be seen or touched in a physical sense. 

**Examples of Abstract Nouns**: \\ joy, peace, creation, goodness, contentment, justice, attitude, freedom, vengeance\\
Hint: English uses common word endings (suffixes) that may help identify abstract nouns. They include such endings as: -tion; -ism; -ity; -ment; -ness; -age; -ance; -ence; -ship; -ability; -acy

Purpose (optional)\\

**Reason this is a translation issue**: The Bible that you translate from may use abstract nouns to express certain ideas. Your language might not use abstract nouns for some of those ideas; instead, it might use other kinds of words such as adjectives, verbs, or adverbs or even sentences to express them.

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**from __childhood__ you have known the sacred writings** (2 Timothy 3:15) \\  
Childhood is an abstract noun that refers to when someone is a child.

**But __godliness__ with __contentment__ is great __gain__.** (1 Timothy 6:6)  \\ 
The abstract nouns "godliness" and "contentment" refer to being godly and content. The abstract noun "gain" refers to something that benefits or helps someone.

**Today __salvation__ has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.** (Luke 19:9) 
The abstract noun "salvation" here refers to being saved.

**You have shown me great __kindness__ in saving my __life__** (Genesis 19:19) 
The abstract noun "kindness" refers to being kind, and the abstract not "life" refers to living.
===== Translation Strategies =====
