===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The strong man** - The strong person" or "Whoever is strong"
  * **will be as tinder** - Here, the strong person is compared to dry wood that is easily broken and burned. This emphasizes that God will make weak those who think they are strong. Alternate translation: "will be like kindling for a fire." (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
  * **and his work as a spark** - This compares the person's deeds or evil works to a spark that sets the tinder on fire. Alternate translation: "His work will be like the small flame that starts the fire."
