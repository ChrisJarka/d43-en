\v 5 Then one of the priests will burn those things on the altar, along with the other parts of the animal that will be completely burned to be an offering \add to Yahweh\add*. And the aroma while it burns will be pleasing to Yahweh.

\v 3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire to Jehovah; the fat that covers the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
\v 4 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
\v 5 And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Jehovah.
