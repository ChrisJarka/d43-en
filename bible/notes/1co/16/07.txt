\v 7 I do not want to see you for only a short time. It is my hope that the time would be long enough for us to be together so it would be  benefitial for all of us.
\v 8 I plan to stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,
\v 9 because the Lord has opened a door for me there, but there are still many obstacles and enemies to our work.
