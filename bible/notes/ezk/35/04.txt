\v 4 I will lay your cities waste, and you shall be desolate; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
\v 5 Because you have had a perpetual enmity, and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time
of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end;
\v 6 therefore, as I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will prepare you to blood, and blood shall pursue you: since you have
not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee.
