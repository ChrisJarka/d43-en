===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Then you became busy buying and selling things,
\q2 and you started to act violently,
\q2 and you sinned.
\q1 So I caused you to be disgraced;
\q2 and the angel who was guarding you forced you to leave my holy mountain,
\q2 forced you to leave your place among those fiery stones.
\q1
\v 17 You were extremely proud
\q2 because you were very handsome.
\q1 Because you loved beautiful things,
\q2 you did things that wise people do not do.
\q1 So I threw you to the ground,
\q2 and allowed other kings who saw you to laugh at you.

\v 16 By the abundance of your traffic they filled the midst of you with violence, and you have sinned: therefore have I cast
you as profane out of the mountain of God; and I have destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
\v 17 Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness: I have cast
you to the ground; I have laid you before kings, that they may behold you.
