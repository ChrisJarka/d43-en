===== Before Translating Open Bible Stories =====

Translation of Open Bible Stories is done by volunteers who desire to see God's Word made available for everyone. Everyone who works on Open Bible Stories must agree with and do their work in accordance with the **Statement of Faith** and must do their work according to the **Translation Guidelines**. Everyone who works on Open Bible Stories must release their work under the **Open License**. All three of these must be followed without exception.
