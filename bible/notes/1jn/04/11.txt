\v 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
\v 12 No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is perfected in us.
\v 13 By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
\v 14 And we have seen and have borne witness that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.
