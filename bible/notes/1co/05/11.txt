\v 11 But now  \add I am stating clearly that\add* when I wrote, I  \add meant that\add* you should not associate with those who say that they are fellow believers, if they are sexually immoral or if they desire and forcefully seize things that belong to others, or worship idols, or slander others, or become drunk. You should not associate with people like that, and you should not even eat with them!
\v 12 It is certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* my business to judge people who are not believers and who do not belong to  \add Christian congregations\add*. But it certainly is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* your business to judge those who are in  \add your congregation\add*.
\v 13 God is the one who will judge those who are not believers\add . Do as the Scriptures command:\add*  "Expel the wicked person from your midst!"

\v 11 But as it is, I wrote to you to not keep companywith any brother if he is a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner. Do not even eat with such a one.
\v 12 For what do I have to do with judging those that are  outside the church? Do you not judge them that are within?
\v 13 But God judges them that are without. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.
