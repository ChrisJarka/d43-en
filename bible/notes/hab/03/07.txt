===== Translation Notes: =====
Habakkuk continues to describe his vision of Yahweh.

    * **the tents of Cushan in affliction, and the fabric of the tents...of Midian trembling** - The people of Midian and Cushan who tremble or shake with fear are like tent cloth that moves when the wind blows. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **tents**  - The movable cloth or animal skin houses people lived in. If your language does not have a word for these, use the word for a temporary shelter.
    * **Was Yahweh angry with the rivers? Was your wrath against the rivers, or your fury against the sea...?**  - "Yahweh was not angry with the rivers. Your wrath was not against the rivers, nor was your fury against the sea...." (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]]) If your language does not have separate words for "angry" and "wrath" and "fury," 
    * **you rode upon your horses, your chariot of salvation** - Yahweh is described as riding a chariot as he comes to save the people of Israel.  The word "chariot" refers to an ancient vehicle used in war.  It had two wheels and was pulled by one or more horses.
