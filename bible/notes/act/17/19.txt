\v 19 They took Paul and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know this new teaching which you were speaking?
\v 20 For you bring some strange things to our ears. Therefore, we want to know what these things mean."
\v 21 (Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing but either telling or listening about something new.)
