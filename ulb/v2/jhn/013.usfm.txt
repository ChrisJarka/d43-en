\c 13
\p
\v 1 Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to
the Father, having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them to the end.
\v 2 And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s
son, to betray him,
\v 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and goes
to God,
\v 4 rises from supper, and lays aside his garments; and he took a towel, and girded himself.
\v 5 Then he pours water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he
was girded.
\v 6 So he comes to Simon Peter. He says to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?
\v 7 Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know not now; but you shall understand hereafter.
\v 8 Peter says to him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with me.
\v 9 Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
\v 10 Jesus says to him, He that is bathed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and you are clean, but
not all.
\v 11 For he knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, You are not all clean.
\p
\v 12 So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said to them, Know you what I have done
to you?
\v 13 You call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and you say well; for so I am.
\v 14 If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
\v 15 For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.
\v 16 Verily, verily, I say to you, A servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that
sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
\v 18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats my bread
lifted up his heel against me.
\v 19 From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, you may believe that I am
he.
\v 20 Verily, verily, I say to you, He that receiveth whoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him
that sent me.
\p
\v 21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, that
one of you shall betray me.
\v 22 The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
\v 23 There was at the table reclining in Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
\v 24 Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, and says to him, Tell
us who it is of whom he speaketh.
\v 25 He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus’ breast says to him, Lord, who is it?
\v 26 Jesus therefore answereth, He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he
takes and gives it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
\v 27 And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore says to him, What you doest, do quickly.
\v 28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him.
\v 29 For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or,
that he should give something to the poor.
\v 30 He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night.
\p
\v 31 When therefore he was gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him;
\v 32 and God shall glorify him in himself, and straightway shall he glorify him.
\v 33 Little children, yout a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Whither I go, you cannot
come; so now I say to you.
\v 34 A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
\v 35 By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.
\p
\v 36 Simon Peter says to him, Lord, whither go you? Jesus answered, Whither I go, you can not follow me now; but
you shall follow afterwards.
\v 37 Peter says to him, Lord, why cannot I follow you even now? I will lay down my life for you.
\v 38 Jesus answereth, Wilt you lay down your life for me? Verily, verily, I say to thee, The cock shall not crow, till you
have denied me thrice.
