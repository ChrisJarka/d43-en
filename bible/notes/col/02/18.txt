\v 18 Disregard those who say that God will punish you because \add you do not worship God in the way that\add* they say \add that you should\add*; that is, they insist that you should humiliate yourselves and that you should worship the angels. \add Disregard such people\add* since they base their authority on things that they have never seen, and since they are proud without reason because their self-directed nature \add controls\add* what they think,
\v 19 and since they do not teach the true teaching about Christ \f + \ft metaphor \f*\add . Christ is the one who causes all of his people to develop\f + \ft Or: grow \f* spiritually as God plans that they should develop\f + \ft Or: grow \f*, just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a person's head directs how his body grows, as it is held together by its joints and ligaments.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Disregard those who say God will punish you if you do not humiliate yourselves and worship the angels. Such people see something and then believe something to be true because of what they saw, but what they have concluded is not true. They can even become very proud about what they believe they have discovered, but their thinking is wrong because they are directed by their sinfulness.
\v 19 Such persons are not connected to Christ. He is like the head of the body, the body being all those who believe in him. The whole body of believers depends upon the head. All the parts of the body are connected together and supported and grow together as God directs through the head, who is Christ.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Let no one disqualify you from the race by a false humility and by worship of angels. Such a person sees things and becomes conceited without cause by his fleshly thinking.
\v 19 He does not hold on to Christ, the head, from whom the whole body is supplied and held together through joints and ligaments, and the body grows as God provides the growth.
