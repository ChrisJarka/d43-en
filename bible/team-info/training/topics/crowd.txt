====== Reasons for Crowd-Sourced Process ======

We are aware the there are approximately 4500 language groups that have not yet received help in translating the Bible into their mother tongue. This includes almost 2000 languages that are target by Vision 2025, but not yet started. It also includes over 2500 other languages that translation organizations have decided "do not **need** a translation." Many of these language groups do not agree that they don't need a translation, but unfortunately, there are no plans to help them. 

WA is committed to helping every language group that **wants** a translation of the Bible to be able to create one. Many church-planting networks, pastor, evangelists, and others are already working on translations among these groups, often at great sacrifice, but with no help. We want to provide that help--quickly!

We used the "normal" process to create the Open Bible Story (OBS) text and notes. It worked. Unfortunately, it is far too slow to use for the task of creating a literal and a dynamic source text and translation notes for the entire Bible. We want to complete the project in 3-5 years. The only way we can do this in that time frame is to involve a lot of qualified people in a crowd-sources approach. So that is what we have set in operation. 

Our "crowd" is not a random group a strangers who somehow stumbled onto our worksite. It is a carefully-selected and recommended group of highly-skilled individuals that we trust to handle the materials carefully and accurately and to create a finished product that will meet the needs of these language groups.

Our "crowd" is primarily comprised of volunteers who work whatever hours they are available during the week. It order to tap into the huge potential of this group, it is necessary that we have a workflow that is not linear. It is not possible to design a process to shuffle content from one person to the next, one at a time, in an orderly fashion and still move with any speed. The only way to allow these volunteers to contribute efficiently is to have them divided into teams on different parts of the project and to have they all working together whenever they are available. That, therefore, is our "crowd" structure and process.
