===== Definition: =====

When "kind" is a noun, it is often a general term to refer to each type of animal or plant that is clearly distinguished from all other types.

  * The main thing that distinguishes each kind as a separate type of animal or plant is that it can reproduce more of its same type.
  * There can be many different variations within each<font 14.4444446563721px line-height: 21.7777786254883px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>"kind" or "type",</font>
  * The word "kind" can also be used with a general meaning of "variety of" as in, "different kinds of spices" (2 Chronicles 16:14)

There is a different English word that looks and sounds exactly the same, but is an adjective meaning to be caring and thoughtful toward others as in, "He is a kind person".
