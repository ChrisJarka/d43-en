<usfm>
\v 8 Your men who teach you \add the laws that Moses wrote\add* have been saying false things \add about those laws\add*.
\q2 So, why \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* do they continue saying, "We are very wise because we have the laws of Yahweh"?
\q1
\v 9 Those teachers, who think that \f + \ft irony \f* they are wise, will be ashamed\f + \ft Or: disgraced \f* and dismayed when they are taken \add to other countries by their enemies\add*
\q2 because they sinned by rejecting what I told them.
\q1 Truly, they were not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* very wise to do that!
\q1
\v 10 So, I will give their wives to other men;
\q2 I will give their fields to \add the enemy soldiers\add* who conquer them.
\q1 All the people, including those who are important and those who are not important, deceive others in order to obtain their possessions.
\q2 Even my prophets and my priests do that.

\v 8 Your men who teach you the laws that Moses wrote have been saying false things about those laws.
\q So, why do they continue saying, "We are very wise because we have the laws of Yahweh"?

\v 9 Those teachers, who think that they are wise, will be ashamed and dismayed when they are taken to other countries by their enemies
\q Because they sinned by rejecting what I told them. Truly, they were not very wise to do that!
\q
\v 10 So, I will give their wives to other men; I will give their fields to the enemy soldiers who conquer them.

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 How can you say, "We are wise, for the law of Yahweh is with us"?
\q Indeed, see! The deceitful pen of the scribes has created deceit.
\q
\v 9 The wise men will be ashamed. They are dismayed and trapped.
\q Behold! They reject Yahweh's word, so what use is their wisdom?
\q
\v 10 So I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who will possess them,
\q because from the least to the greatest, all of them are greedy for dishonest gain! From the prophet to the priest, all of them practice deceit.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues giving Jeremiah his message to the people of Judah.

  * **How can you say, "We are wise, for the law of Yahweh is with us"?** - Yahweh asks this question to make the people of Judah think about what they were saying. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "You think that you are wise because you have the law of Yahweh with you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How can you say** - The "you" here refers to the people of Judah.
  * **Indeed, see!** - These words tell the hearer to pay close attention to what follows.
  * **The deceitful pen of the scribes** - The pen represents the words that the scribes write. AT: "The false things that the scribes write" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **has created deceit** - "has given you false ideas"
  * **The wise men will be ashamed** - "Those men who think they are wise will feel ashamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **dismayed** - "terrified" or "shattered"
  * **Behold!** - "Pay attention!"
  * **so what use is their wisdom?** - This question expects a negative answer and is intended to make the hearers think about how little what they consider wisdom is really worth when they reject Yahweh's word. AT: "so what they think is wise does not do them any good." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **for from the youngest to the greatest ... all of them practice deceit** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:13|6:13]].
  * **from the youngest to the greatest** - This is a merism that means every one of the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
