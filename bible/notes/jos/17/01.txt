\c 17
\p
\v 1 This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh (who was the firstborn of Joseph)—that is, for Makir, who was Manasseh's firstborn and who himself was the father of Gilead. Makir's descendants were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because Makir had been a man of war.
\v 2 Allotments were made to the rest of the people of Manasseh according to their clans—Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh, son of Joseph, according to their clans.
