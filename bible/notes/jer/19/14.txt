\v 14 Then Jeremiah went from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy. He stood in the courtyard of Yahweh's house and he said to all the people,
\v 15 "Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, 'See, I am about to bring to this city and to all of its towns all the disaster that I have proclaimed against it, since they stiffened their neck and
refused to listen to my words.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh of hosts ... says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **See** - "Look" or "Listen." This word adds emphasis to what is said next. AT: "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **stiffened their neck and refused to listen** - These two phrases both speak of the people being stubborn. In the first phrase, Yahweh speaks of the people being stubborn as if they had made their necks stiff. AT: "stubbornly refused to listen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
