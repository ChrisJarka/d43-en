\v 35 Later, while he was teaching in the Temple courtyard, Jesus said to the people, "These men who teach the Jewish laws, they must be wrong when they say that the Messiah is merely a descendant of King David!
\v 36 The Holy Spirit caused David himself to say about the Messiah, God said to my Lord, 'Sit here beside me at the place where I will highly honor you! Sit here while I completely defeat your enemies! '
\v 37 Therefore, because David himself calls the Messiah 'my Lord,' the Messiah cannot be just a man who descended from King David! He must be much greater than David!" Many people listened to him gladly as he taught those things.

\v 35 Jesus answered questions as he taught in the temple, "How do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
\v 36 David himself said by the Holy Spirit,
\q 'The Lord said to my Lord,
\q you sit here in the place of honor
\q until I put your enemies under your feet.'
\m
\v 37 David himself addresses him as Lord. How then is he also his son?" And the great crowd was glad to hear him.
