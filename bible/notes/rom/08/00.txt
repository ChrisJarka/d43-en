====== Romans 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 8:36, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

The first verse of this chapter forms a transitional sentence. It concludes the teaching of chapter 7 and anticipates the material of chapter 8.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Indwelling of the Spirit ==
The Holy Spirit is said to live inside a person or inside their heart. The presence of the Spirit is a sign of a person's [[:en:obe:kt:save|salvation]]. 

== "These are sons of God" ==
While Jesus is the [[:en:obe:kt:sonofgod|son of God]] in a unique way, Christians are also said to be children of God by [[:en:obe:kt:adoption|adoption]].

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
Verses 38 and 39 form an extended [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]] producing a poetic presentation of Paul's teaching. Its explains that nothing can separate a person from the love of God in Jesus.

== On the one hand...on the other hand ==
These phrases are used to speak of two things simultaneously. These two things are usually contrasted with each other, but it is not necessary that they contrast.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== No condemnation ==
This phrase must be translated careful to avoid doctrinal confusion. People are still [[:en:obe:kt:guilt|guilty]] of their sin and God disapproves of their actions, even after they come to [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]] in Jesus. Their sins are still punished but the punishment has been paid for sin and this is what Paul expresses here. There are several possible meanings to the word "[[:en:obe:kt:condemn|condemn]]." Here "condemn" emphasizes that people who believe in Jesus are are no longer punished eternally for their sin by being "condemned to hell."

== Flesh ==

This is a complex issue and it is possible that "[[:en:obe:kt:flesh|flesh]]" is a metaphor for a person's sinful nature. It is not the physical part of man that is sinful and it appears that Paul is teaching that while man remains alive ("in the flesh"), he will remain sinful regardless of his effort. His new nature will fight against his old nature.
