====== Explicit and Implicit Information ======


//This page answers the question: What do the words explicit and implicit mean?// 

//In order to understand this page, it would be good to read://
  * [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences]]

There are two types of written and spoken communication, explicit and implicit information.

  * Explicit information is what the speaker states clearly.
  * Implicit information is what the speaker means but does not state clearly because he expects his audience to already know it or be able to understand it from what he does say.

==== Description ====

When someone speaks or writes, he has in mind a certain audience who is either listening to him or will read what he writes. He has a good idea of what his audience does and does not know, and so he chooses to tell them important things that they do not already know. Normally he does not tell them things that he believes they already know.

>Jesus said to him, "Foxes __have holes__, and the birds of the sky __have nests__, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."  (Matthew 8:20 ULB)

Jesus did not say what foxes and birds use holes and nests for, because the people he was speaking to would have known that foxes sleep in holes in the ground and birds sleep in their nests.

==== Examples from the Bible ====


>it will be more tolerable for __Tyre and Sidon__  at the day of judgment than for you  (Matthew 11:22 ULB)

The original listeners understood that when Jesus spoke about the judgment, he was speaking about how God would judge and punish people for what they have done wrong. They also knew that the people of Tyre and Sidon were very wicked, and they believed that they were better than the people of Tyre and Sidon. Modern readers might not know these things.


>Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not wash their hands when they eat__. (Matthew 15:2 ULB)

Modern readers could think that tradition of washing their hands when eating was to keep from getting sick. But for the Jews, it was a ritual to make themselves ceremonially clean before God.
