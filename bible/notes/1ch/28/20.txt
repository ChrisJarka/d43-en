\v 20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed; for Jehovah God,
even my God, is with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah
be finished.
\v 21 And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God: and there
shall be with you in all manner of work every willing man that has skill, for any manner of service: also the captains and
all the people will be wholly at your commandment.
