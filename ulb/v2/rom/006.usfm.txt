\c 6
\p
\v 1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
\v 2 God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein?
\v 3 Or are you ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
\v 4 We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the
glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.
\v 5 For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall be also
in the likeness of his resurrection;
\v 6 knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we
should no longer be in bondage to sin;
\v 7 for he that has died is justified from sin.
\v 8 But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;
\v 9 knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more has dominion over him.
\v 10 For the death that he died, he died to sin once: but the life that he lives, he lives to God.
\v 11 Even so reckon you also yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey the lusts thereof:
\v 13 neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God, as
alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
\v 14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under law, but under grace.
\p
\v 15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.
\v 16 Know you not, that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obedience, his servants you are whom you obey;
whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?
\v 17 But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were servants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching
whereunto you were delivered;
\v 18 and being made free from sin, you became servants of righteousness.
\v 19 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you presented your members
as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity, even so now present your members
as servants to righteousness to sanctification.
\v 20 For when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard of righteousness.
\v 21 What fruit then had you at that time in the things whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
\v 22 But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, you have your fruit to sanctification, and the end eternal
life.
\v 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
