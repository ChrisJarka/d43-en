====== Key Terms: Link and Page Master ======
**note:** This page and job description has been revised to current procedures (8Jan15).


===== Procedures =====

  - The Key Term Link and Page Master (LPM) will handle the hyperlink and page creation as necessary.
  - Creation of pages will normally be tagged as "create" following the template specified on this page. See templates.
  - Each week "create" tagged key term pages will be promoted to "draft" as those pages are needed to support the Notes Teams efforts.
  - It is up to the KT team leader to promote pages from "draft"  to "publish"
  - At "publish" stage, a check will be made to create all x-ref hyperlinks and remove the "ktlink" tag.

==== Pagename (urlname) naming conventions ====

The key term pagename (urlname) naming convention is:
  - for a single word, the pagename is the key term in lower case letters.
  - for a multi-word phrase, the pagename is the words without spaces, hyphens, or other breaks (ex: kingdomofJudah).

==== Create KT Pages ====
  -create a new kt page with the following link: %%https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/key-terms/urlname%%


==== Create cross references (hyperlinks) ====

  - The display name of the x-ref links for the KT will be the default Key Term Header title.

The link will use the URL name of the term.
