===== Alternate Translation(s) =====

An alternate translation is a suggested change to the form or content of the ULB because the target language has a different form.

Examples include adding implicit information, changing passive voice to active, and stating rhetorical questions as statements. 

The "AT:" indicates that this alternate translation should only be used when the ULB form or content will not fit into the form of your language. Some examples are:

  * **see the salvation of God**  - AT: "learn about how God saves people from sin."
  * **Follow me**  - AT: “Be my disciple” or “Come, follow me as your teacher.”
