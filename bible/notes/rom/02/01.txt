\v 1  God will severely punish non-Jewish people who habitually do evil deeds, because he has clearly revealed that he is angry with them. So, when God judges people, he will not excuse any one of you Jews  to whom I am writing. You say that God should punish non-Jews for doing evil deeds. But when any one of you says that, it is yourself whom you are saying that God should punish, because you do some of the same  evil deeds  that the non-Jews do.
\v 2 We know very well that God will judge and punish fairly  non-Jewish people who do such  evil deeds.
