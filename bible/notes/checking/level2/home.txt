====== Level 2 Checking (Language Community) ======

Level 2 checking will be done by a wider group of people from the language community. It is assumed that the checkers will be native speakers of the language. The purpose of this level of checking is to verify that a larger group of the target population agrees that the translation is a good one.

The primary questions that the community leaders should ask about the translator are:

  * Is the translator recognized as a qualified local language speaker?
  * Does the translator have adequate national language skills?
  * Is the translator respected in the community as a follower of Christ?

The primary questions that the community leaders should ask about the translation are:

  * Do the words and phrases of the translation make the message clear?
  * When compared verse by verse with the national translation, did the meaning of the translation follow the message (not necessarily the wording) of the national translation?
  * Does the flow of the language of the translation sound natural for the language group?
  * Does the translation include all the events of the book that was translated?
  * Is the translation written at a level and style appropriate for the local audience?
  * Is the alphabet and spelling used in the book appropriate for the wider language community?

Each of these topics are important, and will be further developed below.

==== Translator Qualifications ====

The primary questions that the community leaders should ask about the translator are:

Q? Is the translator recognized as a qualified local language speaker?

A. (Has the translator been living in the local community for much of their life? Do people respect the way the person speaks?)

Q? Does the translator(s) have adequate national language skills?

A. (Would they be asked to translate for a national language speaker to help the community members who do not understand the national language well?)

Q? Is the translator respected in the community as a follower of Christ?

A. (How has this person shown themselves to be committed to Christ as a disciple? Can the fruit of God's Holy Spirit be seen in this person's life?)

==== Clear Text ====

Ask questions like the following to see if the translated message is clear:

Q? Do the words and phrases of the translation make the message understandable?

A. (Are the words confusing, or do they tell you plainly what the translator means?)

Q? Do your community members use the words and expressions found in the translation, or has the translator borrowed many words from the national language?

A. (Is this the way your people talk when they want to say important things in your language?)

Q? Can you read the text easily and understand what the writer might say next?

A. (Is the writer a good story teller who is telling things in an interesting way?)

(links to sub-pages as needed)

One way to determine if the text is clear is to read a few verses at a time out loud and ask someone listening to retell the story after each section.  If the person can easily restate your message, then the writing is clear.

==== Accurate Text ====

When listening to the message of the translation and following the message in the national translation, ask the following questions to see if the translator made an accurate translation:

Q? Was everything mentioned in the translation also mentioned in the flow of the national language version?

A. (Did the meaning of the translation follow the message (not necessarily the wording) of the national translation?)

Q? Were the people introduced in each story doing the same things as those mentioned in the national language version?

A. (Was it easy to see who was doing the events of the translation when it was compared to the national language?)

Q?  Are there Key Terms (important words) used in the translation that do not match your understanding of the words in the national version?

A.  (How do your people talk about a priest (one who sacrifices to God) or a temple (the sacrifice place of the Jews) without using a borrowed term?)

Q?  Are the phrases used in the new translation equal to and helpful in understanding the more difficult phrases of the national translation?

A.  (Are the phrases of the new translation put together in a way that brings better understanding and still fit with the meaning of the national language version?)

(links to sub-pages as needed)

One way to determine if the text is accurate is to ask comprehension questions, such as "who, what, when, where, how and why".

==== Natural Language ====

These are questions you can ask to see if the flow of the language of the translation sounds natural for your language group:

Q? Is there a good flow to the language when the passages are read out loud?

A. (Does the language sound like the writer was a person from your own community?)

Q? Does the writer use words well?

A. (Are the people and places of the story described using expressions commonly heard in your community?)

Q? Is this the way people talk in your area?

A. (Does the speaker sound strange or perhaps like someone from outside your community?)

==== All Text Included ====

Sometimes there are differences in verse numbering, or certain verses are put in footnotes.  Ask the following questions to see how the translator handled these situations:

Q?  Does the translation include all the verses of the book that was translated?

A.  (When you look at the verse numbering of the national translation, are all of the verses included in your language translation?)
