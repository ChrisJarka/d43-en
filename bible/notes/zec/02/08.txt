<usfm>
\v 8 The \add armies of the\add* nations that \add attacked you and\add* took away your valuable possessions have attacked those who are very precious to the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels [IDI]. So he says this about me: "After I have honored him and sent him to \add rebuke\add* the nations,
\v 9 \add it is as though\add* I will strike them with my fist, with the result that those who were their slaves will now take back those possessions from those who caused them to become slaves." And when that happens, you will know that the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels is the one who sent me.

\v 8 For thus says Yahweh of hosts; according to his glory he sent me to the nations who plundered you, since the one who touches
you touches the apple of God's eye!
\v 9 I myself will shake my hand over them, and they will be plunder for their slaves; so you will know that
Yahweh of hosts has sent me.!
