===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him; this began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|10:16]].


  * **When they deliver you up** - "When people hand you over to the councils." The "people" here are the same "people" as in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|10:17]].
  * **you** - The pronouns "you" and "your" throughout this passage refers to the twelve apostles.
  * **do not be anxious** - "do not worry"
  * **how or what you will speak** - "how you are to speak or what you are to say." The two ideas may be combined: "what you are to say." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
  * **in that hour** - "at that time" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **the Spirit of your Father** - If necessary, this can be translated "the Spirit of God your heavenly Father" or a footnote added to the text to make clear that this refers to God the Holy Spirit and not to the spirit of an earthly father.
  * **the Spirit of your Father** - God the Spirit and God the Father are one, though distinct persons of God. Translators are encouraged to translate these words for the persons of God with ideas that express the original ideas of "father" and "son" and "spirit," as contained in the Scriptures. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **in you** - "through you"
