====== Edit the ULB ======

=== Purpose of the ULB ===

The ULB (UnfoldingWord Literal Bible) is a "literal" version that is intended as a source text for translation of the Bible that will not only convey the meaning of the original language very closely, but will try to reflect the form of the ordinal text as much as possible without causing problems in comprehension.

The ULB is not a "finished translation." Rather, its purpose is to serve as a source language for other translations. Therefore, it is more important that it convey the meaning of the Bible text than it is to be "polished." However, the ULB should still be easy to read--even for people whose first language is not English. 


=== Source of the ULB ===

The ULB is an adaptation of the 1901 ASV. The ASDV is a very literal translation, but it has an abundance of archaic terminology. We are removing much of this terminology by automatic scripting on the server. But many unclear words and phrases remain. They need to be undated so as to be understandable to a modern audience.


=== Style of the ULB ===

The ULB is intended to be accompanied by the translation notes and key-term explanations. Furthermore, the UDB will provide alternative "dynamic" translation suggestions. Therefore, it is acceptable for the ULB to retain much of the structure, word order, and terminology of the original languages, as long as they are not overly difficult to understand. 


=== Editing the ULB ===

The primary tasks of editors of the ULB are:

  * Remove the section headings (/s) and titles (/sr).
  * Remove all footnotes.
  * Divide the text into small, manageable chunks of 1-4 verses using a space and (/s5).
  * Verify that the chunks match the division of the UDB.
  * Check that the English level is easy to understand.
  * Divide the text into shorter sentences where possible.
  * Retain the literal nature of the text--it should compliment the "dynamic" UDB rather than be similar to it.
