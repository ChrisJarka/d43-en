\c 5
\p
\v 1 It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that
one of you has his fatherâ€™s wife.
\v 2 And you are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.
\v 3 For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that has so
wrought this thing,
\v 4 in the name of our Lord Jesus, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
\v 5 to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord
Jesus.
\v 6 Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
\v 7 Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For our passover also has been
sacrificed, even Christ:
\v 8 wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
\p
\v 9 I wrote to you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;
\v 10 not at all meaning with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with
idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world:
\v 11 but as it is, I wrote to you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or
an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.
\v 12 For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not you judge them that are within?
\v 13 But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.
