\v 14 So, \add I say to\add* you people whom I love, \add avoid\add* worshipping idols \add just like you would\add* run away from \add anything that is dangerous\add*.
\v 15 It is to people who \add think that they\add* are wise that I write. So, you, as wise people, judge whether what I am writing \add is true\add*.
\v 16 \add During the Lord's Supper, after we ask God to\add* bless the \add wine\add*\f + \ft Or: the \add grape juice\add* \f* \add in the\add* cup, we give thanks for it \add and drink it\add*. By doing that, we certainly are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* sharing in what Christ \add did for us when\add* his blood \add flowed from his body when he died. During the Lord's Supper, when we break\add* the bread\add and eat it\add*, we are certainly sharing in \f + \ft metonymy \f* what Christ \add did for us when\add* his body \add suffered for us on the cross\add*.\f + \ft Or: are we not sharing in ( metonymy ) what Christ \add did for us when\add* his body \add suffered for us on the cross?\add* \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 17 Because it is one loaf of bread that we \add break and eat during the Lord's Supper, it symbolizes that\add* we who are many are one group, because we all eat from the one loaf.

\v 14 Therefore, my loved ones, run with all you might away from any kind worship of idols; do not serve anything or anyone other that God alone.
\v 15 I speak to you as people who consider carefully how you live and  what you do, and I ask you to be discerning and to carefully consider what I say.
\v 16 Does not the communion cup we share together represent the blood of Christ? Does not the bread we share together represent the body of Christ?
\v 17 During communion there is one loaf of bread, and we who are in the body of Christ all make up one body together, and we all take and eat of the one loaf of bread together.
