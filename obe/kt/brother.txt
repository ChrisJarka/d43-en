====== brother ======

===== Definition: =====

A brother is a male person who shares at least one biological parent with another person. There are also some figurative meanings of this word:

  * In the Old Testament the term "brothers" is often used figuratively as a general reference to relatives, such as members of the same tribe, clan, or people group.
  * In the New Testament, the apostles often used "brothers" to refer to fellow Christians, including both men and women, since all believers in Christ are members of one spiritual family, with God as their heavenly Father.
  * A few times in the New Testament, the apostles use the term "sister" when referring specifically to a fellow Christian who was a woman, or to emphasize that both men and women are being included. For example, when James says, "a brother or sister who is in need of food or clothing," he is emphasizing that he is talking about all believers.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * It is best to translate this term with the literal word that is used in the target language to refer to a natural or biological brother, unless this would give wrong meaning.
  * Other ways to translate this could include, "brother in Christ" or "spiritual brother."
  * In the Old Testament especially, when "brothers" is used very generally to refer to members of the same family, clan, or people group, possible translations could include, "relatives" or "clan members" or "fellow Israelites."
  * In the New Testament, if "brother" would give a wrong meaning and your language has a general kinship term that can include both males and females, then this term could be used in contexts where all believers are being referred to.
  * Other ways to translate this term so that it refers to all believers could be, "fellow believers" or "Christian brothers and sisters."
  * Make sure to check the context to determine whether only men are being referred to, or whether both men and women are included.
