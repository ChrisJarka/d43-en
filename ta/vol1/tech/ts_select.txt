===== Select Source and Target Languages =====

This module answers the question: How do I select source and target languages?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_install|Install translationStudio on an Android Device]]

You can select and change your source language and target language whenever you use translationStudio.\\

**Note:** The first time you use the application, translationStudio opens at the **Project Settings** screen so you can select your languages. To get to this screen any other time, tap **Project Settings** in the green bar at the top of the screen.\\

Complete these steps to select or change the target language, which is the language you are translating TO:

   * Tap **Project ****Settings**.
   * The gray bar under **Target Language**  shows the current target language. Tap the gray bar to open the list of available target languages.
   * Tap above the list to open the keyboard.
   * Type the first few letters of your language to navigate to that portion of the list.
   * Tap on your language. If you wish to hide the keyboard, tap the triangle in the black bar below the list.
   * When you have selected your language, tap **OK **  in the upper right corner.
   * If you are satisfied with your target language, tap **OK **  again in the upper right corner. Otherwise repeat these steps to select the correct language.

Complete these steps to select or change the source language, which is the language you are translating FROM:

   * Tap **Project ****Settings**.
   * The gray bar under **Source Language**  shows the current source language (English is the default language). Tap the gray bar to open the list of available source languages.
   * Tap above the list to open the keyboard.
   * Type the first few letters of your language to navigate to that portion of the list.
   * Tap on the desired source language. To hide the keyboard, tap the triangle in the black bar below the list.
   * When you have selected your language, tap **OK **  in the upper right corner.
   * If you are satisfied with your source language, tap **OK **  again in the upper right corner. Otherwise repeat these steps to select the correct language.
