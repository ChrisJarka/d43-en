===== Choosing a Translation Team =====

This module answers the question: How do I choose a translation team?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_whatis|What is Translation]]
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_why|Why We Translate the Bible]]

Translating the Bible is a very large and difficult task that will take many people to accomplish. This module will discuss the skills that will be needed by members of the Bible translation team, and the responsibilities that these people will have. Some people will have many skills and responsibilities, and other people will have only a few. But it is important that every Bible translation team include enough people to make sure that all of these skills are represented on the team.

===Church Leaders===
Before starting a translation project, as many church networks as possible should be contacted and encouraged to become a part of the translation and even to send some of their people to be a part of the translation team. They should be consulted and asked for their input into the translation project, its goals, and its process. 

===Translation Committee===
It is good if the leaders of these churches and church networks can form a committee to guide the work, choose the translators, resolve problems that arise, and encourage the churches to pray for the work and to support the work financially. 
This committee can also choose the people who will check the translation for accuracy at levels 2 and 3.
When it comes time, this committee can also make decisions about the format of the translation, how it will be distributed, and they can encourage the churches to use the translated Scriptures.

===The Translators===
These are the people who will do the work of making the translation drafts. They will be appointed by the Translation Committee. They need to be people who are native speakers of the target language, who can read the source language very well, and who are respected in the community for their Christian character. For more details about these things, see [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:qualifications]]. 

As well as making the first drafts, these people will form the core of the translation team that will check each other's work, check the translation with the language community, and receive the suggestions for revision from the level 2 and level 3 checkers. After each review or checking session, these translators are responsible to make the changes to the translation that are necessary so that it commuicates what it should in the best way. So they will revise the translation many, many times.




- What is the age and local language background of each translator?

  * Does their work meet the expectations of their fellow translators and local church leaders? (Has the translator been willing to work with others in testing and checking their translation?)
