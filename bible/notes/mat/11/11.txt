\v 11 Note this: of all the people who have ever lived, God does not consider any of them to be greater than John the Baptizer. At the same time, God considers that all the people over whom he will agree to rule are greater than John, even if they are the least people whom he rules.
\v 12 From the time that John the Baptizer preached until now, some people have tried to force God to rule as they want him to rule, and they have tried to force him to rule so they can profit from it.

\v 11 I say to you truly, among those born of women no one is greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is.
\v 12 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by force.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

  * **I say to you truly** - "I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
  * **among those born of women** - This is a way of referring to all humans. AT: "out of all people who have ever lived." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **no one is greater than John the Baptist** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "John the Baptist is the greatest" or "John the Baptist is the most important."
  * **the least important person in the kingdom of heaven** - Here "kingdom" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is only used in Matthew. If possible, try to keep "heaven" in your translation. AT: "the least important person under the rule of our God in heaven." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **is greater than he is** - "is more important than John is"
  * **From the days of John the Baptist** - "From the time John began preaching his message"
  * **the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by force** - Possible meanings are 1) people are using violence to bring about God's rule, or 2) violent people are harming God's people and trying to stop God from showing himself as king.
