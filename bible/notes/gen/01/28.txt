===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **God blessed them** - The word "them" refers to the man and woman God had created.
  * **Be fruitful, and multiply** -  This is God's blessing. He told them to produce more people like themselves so that there would be many of them. See how you translated "Be fruitful and multiply" in [[en:bible:notes:gen:01:22|1:22]]. These two phrases, "Be fruitful" and "multiply," say the same thing for emphasis. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:doublet.]])
  * **Fill the earth**  - Fill the earth with people.
