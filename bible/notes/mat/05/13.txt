===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 13 "\bd You\bd* are \add able to influence\add* evil \add people\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add and improve the way they live in order that they do not become more evil, just like\add* salt \add is able to improve the flavor of food and to preserve it\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add from spoiling\add*. Salt that no longer tastes salty cannot become salty again \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. As a result, that salt becomes useless. It is rejected by people, thrown on the ground, and walked on \f + \ft Or:People reject it, throw it on the ground and walk on it \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if the way you live no longer influences people to live in a godly manner, God will reject you\add*. \v 14 \bd You\bd* \add enable\add* evil \add people\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to perceive God's truth as\add* a light \add enables people to perceive what is around them. Just like\add* everyone can see \f + \ft litotes \f* \add the lights of\add* a city on a hill \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add other people can see what you do\add*. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 13 What salt does for food, this is what you will do for the world. But if salt loses its power, no one can make it good again. People just throw it out and walk over it. \v 14 What light does for people in the dark, this is what you will do for the world. All people will see you, just as they see a city built on a hillside. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 13 You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again? It is never again good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under by people's feet. \v 14 You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be concealed. </usfm>
