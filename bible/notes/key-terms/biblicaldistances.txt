  * cubit = 46 centimeters (18 inches)
  * furlong = 202 meters (660 feet)
  * span = 23 centimeters (9 inches)

There are different ways that units of measure for distance can be translated:

  - Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. [See Transliterate]
  - An important reason for keeping the Bible terms is to show that the Bible is true and people actually used these units of measure during that time period.
  - If it doesn't work to use the Bible term, then instead, state the same distance or length in terms of a unit of measure that is known.
