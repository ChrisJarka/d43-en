====== 2 Samuel 17 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Ahithophel and Hushai both advise Absalom ==
Ahithophel said he would take 12,000 soldiers now and attack David and his army while they were tired and discouraged. Hushai said no, David and his men were very brave and experienced and David had already hidden himself and if his soldiers kill some of Absalom's men then everyone in Israel will be afraid because everyone knew that they are very brave and good soldiers. Then Hushai sent a message to David not to stay nearby but to cross to the east side of the river that night. Absalom decided to follow Hushai's advice. Ahithophel went home and hung himself.
== David set up in Mahanaim ==
David arrived in Mahanaim, east of the Jordan River. Many people came and brought his army food, sleeping mats and cooking pots.
