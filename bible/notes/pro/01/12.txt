<usfm>
\v 12 We will kill them \f + \ft hyperbole \f* and get rid of them completely,

\q1 While they are in good health, we will send them to the place where dead people are.
\q1
\v 13 And we will seize all the things that they own.
\q2 We will fill our houses with these things!
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Like the grave has power to take even a healthy person and drag them to the place of the dead, we will take their life from them.
\q2 We will make them like those who fall into the place where there is no hope of escape.
\q1
\v 13 We will find many valuable and expensive items,
\q2 and we will fill our houses with what we stole from them!
\q1
\v 14 So, come, be part of our team!
\q2 We will split into equal shares, and give to each member of our team, from all the things we stole."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Verses 12-14 conclude the hypothetical statement of the sinners who are trying to entice others into sin (see verse 10).

    * **Let us swallow them up alive, like Sheol takes away those who are healthy**  - The wicked picture themselves as an animal that is able to swallow their victim whole. In the same way that death can claim even the healthy, the wicked expect to destroy their victim.
    * **Throw in your lot with us**  - "Join us" or "be part of our team." (UDB)
    * **purse**  - A purse is a bag for carrying money.
