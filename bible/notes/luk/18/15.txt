\v 15 And they were bringing to him also their babies, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
\v 16 But Jesus called them to him, saying, Permit the little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for to such belongs the kingdom of God.
\v 17 Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no way enter therein.
