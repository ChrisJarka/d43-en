====== John 03 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Light ==
[[:en:obe:kt:light|Light]] is a common image in Scripture used to represent [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]]. Light is also used to show the path of righteousness and to show righteous living. [[:en:obe:kt:darkness|Darkness]] is often used as an image to represent [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] or [[:en:obe:kt:unrighteous|unrighteousness]].

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "We know that you are a teacher come from God" ==
Although this appears to be display of faith, it is not. This is because believing Jesus is "only a teacher" shows a lack of awareness of who he truly is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

== "Son of Man" ==

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" in this passage. It may not be possible in every language to have someone speaking about himself in the third person.
