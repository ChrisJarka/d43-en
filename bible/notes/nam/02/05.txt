===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The one who will dash you to pieces** - The word "you" refers to Nineveh. Nahum speaks of an army or military leader destroying Nineveh as if he were to shatter Nineveh like one would shatter a clay pot. Translate this the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:nam:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "The one who will destroy you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in their march** - The word "march" can be translated as a verb. AT: "as they march" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **they ... their ... they** - the soldiers who will attack Nineveh
  * **in their march** - "as they march"
