Hendiadys is when a speaker makes a single idea more forceful by connecting two nouns or adjectives with “and” when one of the words actually describes the other.

==== Description ====

Hendiadys is when a speaker expresses a single idea by connecting two words with “and” when one of the words actually describes the other.

**his own __kingdom and glory__** (1 Thessalonians 2:12)\\
Though "kingdom" and "glory" are both nouns, "glory" actually tells what kind of "kingdom" it is: it is a kingdom of glory or a glorious kingdom.

**Reasons this is a translation issue**\\
  * Often hendiadys has an abstract noun. Some languages may not have a noun with the same meaning.
  * Some languages do not use hendiadys, so people may not understand that one word describes the other. 


==== Examples from the Bible ====

>for I will give you __words and wisdom__ (Luke 21:15 ULB)

"Words" and "wisdom" are nouns, but in this figure of speech "wisdom" is meant to describe "words."

**if you are willing and obedient** (Isaiah 1:19 ULB)\\
"willing" and "obedient" are adjectives, but "willing" describes "obedient."

==== Translation Strategies ====

If the hendiadys would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here are other options:

  - Substitute the noun that describes the other noun with an adjective that means the same thing.
  - Substitute the adjective that describes the other adjective with an adverb that means the same thing. 

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Substitute the noun that describes the other noun with an adjective that means the same thing.
  * **for I will give you __words and wisdom__** (Luke 21:15 ULB)
      * "For I will give you __wise words__"

  * **that you should walk in a manner that is worthy of God, who calls you to __his own kingdom and glory__.**  (1 Thessalonians 2:12 ULB)
      * "that you should walk in a manner that is worthy of God, who calls you to __his own glorious kingdom__."


2. Substitute the adjective that describes the other adjective with an adverb that means the same thing. 
  * **if you are willing and obedient** (Isaiah 1:19 ULB)
    * "if you are willingly obedient"
    * "if you obey willingly"

3. Substitute other parts of speech that mean the same thing and show that one word describes the other. In the example below, the adjective "obedient" is substituted with the verb "obey."
  * **if you are willing and obedient** (Isaiah 1:19 ULB)
    * "if you obey willingly"
