{{:en:obs:obs-15-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The **[[:en:obe:other:israel|Israelites]]** were angry when they found out that the **[[:en:obe:other:gibeon|Gibeonites]]** had deceived them, but they kept the **[[:en:obe:other:peace|peace]]** treaty they had made with them because it was a **[[:en:obe:kt:promise|promise]]** before **[[:en:obe:kt:god|God]]**. Sometime later, the **[[:en:obe:other:king|kings]]** of another people group in **[[:en:obe:other:canaan|Canaan]]**, the **[[:en:obe:other:amorite|Amorites]]**, heard that the Gibeonites had made a peace treaty with the Israelites, so they combined their armies into one large army and attacked **[[:en:obe:other:gibeon|Gibeon]]**. The Gibeonites **sent a message to [[:en:obe:other:joshua|Joshua]] asking for help**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **sent a message to Joshua asking for help** - This could be translated as, “sent some of their people to tell Joshua that they needed the Israelites to help defend them against their enemies.”
