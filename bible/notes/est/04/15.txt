\v 15 Then Esther sent this answer to Mordecai,
\v 16 Go, gather together all the Jews who live  in Susa, and fast for me, and not eat nor drink for three days,
night or day. My maidens and I will fast in like manner; and so I will go in to the king, which is not according to the
law: and if I perish, I perish.
