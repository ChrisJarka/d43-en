\v 1 Whither is your beloved gone,
\q O you fair among women?
\q Whither has your beloved turned him,
\q That we may seek him with thee?
\b
\q
\v 2 My beloved is gone down to his garden,
\q To the beds of spices,
\q To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
\q
\v 3 I am my belovedâ€™s, and my beloved is mine;
\q He feedeth his flock among the lilies,
\b
\q
\v 4 You are fair, O my love, as Tirzah,
\q Comely as Jerusalem,
\q Terrible as an army with banners.
\q
\v 5 Turn away your eyes from me,
\q For they have overcome me.
\q Your hair is as a flock of goats,
\q That lie along the side of Gilead.
\q
\v 6 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes,
\q Which are come up from the washing;
\q Whereof every one has twins,
\q And none is bereaved among them.
\q
\v 7 Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate
\q Behind your veil.
\q
\v 8 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines,
\q And virgins without number.
\q
\v 9 My dove, my undefiled, is but one;
\q She is the only one of her mother;
\q She is the choice one of her that bare her.
\q The daughters saw her, and called her blessed;
\q Yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
\b
\q
\v 10 Who is she that looks forth as the morning,
\q Fair as the moon,
\q Clear as the sun,
\q Terrible as an army with banners?
\b
\q
\v 11 I went down into the garden of nuts,
\q To see the green plants of the valley,
\q To see whether the vine budded,
\q And the pomegranates were in flower.
\q
\v 12 Before I was aware, my soul set me
\q Among the chariots of my princely people.
\b
\q
\v 13 Return, return, O Shulammite;
\q Return, return, that we may look upon thee.
\q Why will you look upon the Shulammite,
\q As upon the dance of Mahanaim?
