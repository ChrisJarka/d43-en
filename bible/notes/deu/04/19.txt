<usfm>
\v 19 Be careful when you lift your eyes up to the heavens and look at the sun, the moon, or the stars—all the host of the heavens—be careful that you are not drawn away to worship them and adore them—those things that Yahweh your God has assigned them there for all the people under the whole sky.
\v 20 But Yahweh has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of his own inheritance, as you are today.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Be careful when you lift your eyes ... and look ... be careful that you are not drawn ... Yahweh your God** - Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" and the commands "be careful" are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **all the host of the heavens** - This is another way of referring to the sun, moon, and stars.
  * **that you are not drawn away to worship** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that you do not worship" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **that Yahweh your God has assigned them there** - "that Yahweh your God has put there"
