===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It happened**  - This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **Then their eyes were opened**  - "then they understood" or "then they realized"
  * **he vanished out of their sight** - This means that suddenly he was no longer there. It does not mean that he became invisible.
  * **Was not our heart burning…**  -  "Our hearts were burning within us" or "we became so excited that it was as though a fire was burning within us!" (UDB) This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. It is used to express their excitement and wonder about realizing that Jesus had been with them. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **burning within us…**  - The two men were speaking to each other. So the word "us" is dual inclusive for languages that make these distinctions. (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:pluralpronouns]] and [[en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive]])
