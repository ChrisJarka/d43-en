===== Introduction to unfoldingWord =====

Welcome to unfoldingWord! [[http://unfoldingword.org|unfoldingWord]] is a project put together and managed by various missions organizations and volunteers from around the world who think that everyone should have adequate Biblical content, in their own language, without copyright restrictions, and for free.

unfoldingWord uses tools like [[en:ta:tech:door43|Door43]] and [[en:ta:tech:ts|translationStudio]] as platforms where the global church can collaborate to translate open Biblical content. We have also created a [[en:ta:check|three-tier checking system]] which empowers the global church not only to translate the content, but to corroborate its accuracy. unfoldingWord is also a digital publishing engine that will push checked content through the engine to make it available online, on the [[en:ta:tech:uw|unfoldingWord mobile app]], for download, and in print-ready formats. By empowering the global church in this way, we believe this process will help provide unrestricted Biblical content, in every language, for every people group.

All unfoldingWord projects follow three important documents:
  * [[statement-of-faith|Statement of Faith]] - the theological guidelines for all unfoldingWord resources and translations
  * [[translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines]] - the translation guidelines required of all translations
  * [[license|Open License]] - the open license which governs all unfoldingWord content
