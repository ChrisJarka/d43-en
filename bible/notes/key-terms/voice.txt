===== Definition: =====

Voice is the sound made when talking or singing. Voice can also mean the opinion of a group of people, or the right to express the opinion of a group of people.

  * For example, a town leader may hold a town meeting to hear the voice, that is, the opinion of the town's people on a particular issue.
  * Voice is also another word for message, as in Psalm 19:1-4 where no literal person's voice is spoken.
