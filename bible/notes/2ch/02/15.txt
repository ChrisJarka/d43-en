===== translationNotes: =====
  * **Connecting Statement:** - This continues the message from Hiram, king of Tyre, to Solomon.

  * **of which my master has spoken, let him send these things to his servants** - Hiram refers to Solomon as "my master" and to himself and his own people as "his servants." This is a way of showing respect. AT: "of which you, my master, have spoken, please send these things to us, your servants" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **you will carry it up to Jerusalem** - Here "you" refers to Solomon. The readers should understand that Solomon probably
commanded other people to do the actual work. AT: "you will command your people to take the wood to Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
