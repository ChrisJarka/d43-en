<usfm> \v 13 These are the measurements of the altar, using the same kind of measuring stick that was used for the temple area: There is a gutter around the altar that is about one-half meter deep and one-half meter wide. There is a rim around it that is about twenty cm. wide. This is the base for the rest of the altar. \v 14 The lower part of the gutter is about one meter high to the lower ledge that surrounds the altar. The lower ledge is about one-half meter wide. The upper part of the altar is about two meters high, up to the upper ledge. That ledge is also one-half meter wide. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 13 These will be the measurements of the alter in cubits—each cubit being a cubit and a span. So the groove of the altar will be a cubit, and the width will be a cubit. And its border around its surrounding edge will be one handspan. This will be the base of the altar. \v 14 From the groove of the earth to the lower edging – two cubits, and one cubit wide. Then from the smaller edging to the greater edging – four cubits, and a cubit wide. </usfm>
