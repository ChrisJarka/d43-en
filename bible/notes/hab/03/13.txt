===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 You went forth for the salvation of your people,
\q for the salvation of your anointed one!
\q You shatter the head of the house of the wicked
\q to expose the base of the neck! \qs [Selah.\qs*
[[There is no need to either make this “thigh” as is popular, or to reinterpret neck to mean ‘rock’ as the UBS guidebook does. Removing the head exposes the base of the neck, ie. The stump. This seems to both fit the context and the language. It is bloody, but theologically and linguistically valid.]]
