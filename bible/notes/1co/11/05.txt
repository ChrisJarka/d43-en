\v 5 But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if her head were shaven.
\v 6 For if a woman will not cover her head, she should cut her hair short. But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, she should cover her head.
