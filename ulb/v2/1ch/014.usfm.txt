\c 14

\v 1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.
\v 2 And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people
Israelâ€™s sake.
\p
\v 3 And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David became the father of more sons and daughters.
\v 4 And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
\v 5 and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,
\v 6 and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
\v 7 and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
\p
\v 8 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David:
and David heard of it, and went out against them.
\v 9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 10 And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and will you deliver them into my hand? And
Jehovah said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.
\v 11 So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken mine enemies by my hand,
like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
\v 12 And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.
\p
\v 13 And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.
\v 14 And David inquired again of God; and God said to him, You shall not go up after them: turn away from them, and come
upon them over against the mulberry-trees.
\v 15 And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then you shall go out
to battle; for God is gone out before you to strike the host of the Philistines.
\v 16 And David did as God commanded him: and they struck the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.
\v 17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations.
