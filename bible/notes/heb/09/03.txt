\v 3 Behind the curtain inside the holy place there was another room. That was called the very holy place.
\v 4 It had an altar covered with gold for burning incense. It also had the chest which they called the "ark of the covenant." All its sides were covered with gold. In it was the golden pot which contained pieces of the food they called manna. That was the food with which God miraculously fed the people before they entered the promised land. In the chest there was also Aaron's walking stick that budded to prove that he was God's true priest. In the chest were also the stone tablets on which God had written the Ten Commandments.
\v 5 On top of the chest were figures of winged creatures that symbolized God's glory. Their wings overshadowed the sacred chest's lid where the high priest sprinkled the blood to atone for the sins of the people. I do not need to write about these things in detail now.

\v 3 And after the second tent wall was the room that is called the most holy place,
\v 4 having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant completely overlaid with gold, inside which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaronâ€™s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.
\v 5 Above the ark of the covenant  figures of glorious cherubim hovered over the atonement lid,  about which we cannot now describe in detail.
