===== Translation Notes: =====
The author speaks to Yahweh about Yahweh's relationship with the people of Israel using poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **sell your people for nothing**- When Yahweh allows his people to be taken into slavery they compare it to being sold for no money. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **rebuke to our neighbors...scoffing and a derision to those around us...insult among the nations...shaking of the head among the people** - These all have the same meaning.  The same concept is stated in many ways to add emphasis.
