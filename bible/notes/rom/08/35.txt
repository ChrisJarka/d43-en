\v 35 Absolutely no one and nothing can cause Christ to stop loving us! That could not happen, even if someone afflicts us, or even someone harms us, or even if we have nothing to eat, or even if we do not have enough clothes, or even if we live in a dangerous situation, or even if someone will kill us.
\v 36 Such things may happen to us, just as it is written that David said to God, â€œBecause we are your people, others repeatedly attempt to kill us. They consider that we are only people to be killed, like a butcher considers that sheep are only animals to be slaughtered."

\v 36 Just as it is written,
\q "For your benefit we are killed all day long.
\q We were considered as sheep for the slaughter."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Who will separate us from the love of Christ?** - Paul uses a question for emphasis. Alternate translation: "No one can separate us from the love that Christ has for us." (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
    * **Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?** - The words "tribulation" and "distress" mean basically the same thing. The word "sword" refers to violence or death. Alternate translation: It is not possible even if someone causes us trouble, hurts us, takes away our clothes and food, or even kills us." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]] and [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
    * **For your benefit** - Here "you" is singular and refers to God. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou-singular]])
    * **we are killed all day long** - Here "we" refers to the one who wrote this part of Scripture and includes all those who remain loyal to God. The phrase "all day long" is an exaggeration to emphasize how much danger they are in. Paul uses this part of Scripture to show that all who belong to God should expect difficult times. This can be translated with an active verb: "our enemies continually seek to kill us." (See: [[en:ta:translate:inclusive]] and [[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]] and [[en:ta:translate:active]])
    * **We were considered as sheep for the slaughter** - This compares those who die because they are loyal to God to sheep that someone killed as a sacrifice to God. (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
