\v 20 Noah built an altar to Yahweh. He took some of the clean animals and some of the clean birds, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
\v 21 Yahweh smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart, "I will not again curse the ground because of mankind, even though the inclination of their hearts is evil from childhood. Nor will I again destroy everything living, as I have done.
\v 22 While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night will not cease."

  * **built an altar to Yahweh**  - "built an altar dedicated to Yahweh" or "built an altar for worshiping Yahweh".

  * **burnt offering **- After the animal was killed, Noah burned the whole animal as an offering to God. Because God does not have a body and does not eat, only the smoke goes up to God.

  * **curse the ground**  - this refers to the cursing of the ground because of Adam and Eve's disobedience earlier in the story (see [[:en:bible:notes:gen:03:17|Gen 3:17]]).
