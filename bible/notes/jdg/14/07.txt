\v 7 He went and talked with the woman, and she pleased him very much.
\v 8 After a while he returned to take her as his wife; he turned aside from his path to see the carcass of the lion, and, behold, there was a
swarm of bees and honey in the lion’s body.
\v 9 He took the honey in his hands and went on, eating as he went; he came to his father and mother and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the lion’s body.
