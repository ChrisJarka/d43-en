\v 16 Go to Egypt and gather together the elders. Say to them, 'Yahweh, the God whom Abraham worshipped, whom Isaac worshipped, and whom Jacob worshipped, has appeared to me and said: I have seen what the Egyptian people have done to you.
\v 17 I promise that I will rescue you from being treated badly in Egypt, and I will take you to the land where the descendants of Canaan, Heth, Amor, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus live. It is a good land where you can grow many crops and raise much livestock.'
\v 18 My people will do what you say. Then you and the Israelite elders will go to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, 'Yahweh, whom we Hebrews worship as God, has met with us. So now we ask you to allow us to travel for three days to a place in the wilderness in order that there we may offer sacrifices to Yahweh, our God.'

\v 16 Go and gather the elders of Israel together. Say to them, 'Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, 'I have indeed observed you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.
\v 17 I have promised to bring you up out of the oppression in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites,  the Hivites, and the Jebusites to a land flowing with milk and honey.'
\v 18 They will listen to you. You and the elders of Israel must go to the king of Egypt, and you must tell him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. So now let us go three daysâ€™ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.'
