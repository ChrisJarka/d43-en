\v 4 The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests under him, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of the temple of Yahweh all the vessels that were made for Baal and Asherah, and for all the stars of
heaven, and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley and carried their ashes to Bethel.
