\v 9 Then said he to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and
the city full of wresting of judgment: for they say, Jehovah has forsaken the land, and Jehovah sees not.
\v 10 And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.
\v 11 And, behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you
have commanded me.
