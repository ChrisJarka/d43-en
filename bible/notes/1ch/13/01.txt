\v 1 \add One day\add* David talked with all his army officers. Some of them were commanders of 100 soldiers and some were commanders of 1,000 soldiers.
\v 2 Then he summoned the other Israelite leaders and said to all of them, "If it seems to you to be a good thing for us to do, and if it is what Yahweh our God wants, let's send a message to our fellow Israelites in all the areas of our country, including the priests and descendants of Levi who are living among them in their towns and in the nearby pasturelands, to come and join us,
\v 3 because we want to bring the Sacred Chest of our God back to us. While Saul \add was the king\add*, we did not go to God's presence to ask him what we should do."
\v 4 All the people agreed with David, because they all thought that it was the right thing to do.

\p
\v 1 David consulted with the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with every leader.
\v 2 David said to all the assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you, and if this comes from Yahweh our God, let us send messengers everywhere to our brothers who remain in all the regions of Israel, and to the priests and Levites who are in their cities. Let them be told to join us.
\v 3 Let us bring the ark of our God back to ourselves, for we did not seek his will in the days of Saul's reign."
\v 4 The whole assembly agreed to do these things, because they seemed right in the eyes of all the people.
