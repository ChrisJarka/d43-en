=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Saul rescues the people of Jabesh Gilead ==

Nahash, king of the Amorites and his army surrounded the Israeli town of Jabesh Gilead. When they asked for peace terms he demanded the right to poke out one eye of every man to show Israel how weak they were. They asked for a week to ask other Israelis for help. When Saul heard this he cut his oxen into pieces and sent them all around Israel saying that he would cut up the oxen of anyone who did not come to help save Jebesh. Very many people came to his army. Then he sent a message to Jebesh that he would save them the next day before noon. So they told Nahash that they would surrender to him the next day. Saul then marched his army all night and attacked the Amorites long before it got light in the morning and scattered their army. Then everyone wanted Saul as their king; so Samuel had another service to reconfirm him as king.
