====== Order of Events ======

In English, events are not always told in the order in which they occurred.  Sometimes the author may need to discuss something that happened at an earlier time.  The English language does this by using different tenses or time words such as ‘yesterday’, ‘last year’ or ‘before that.’

Other languages clearly state the order of events to avoid confusion. It is important to help your readers understand the correct order of events when translating into your language.

Clarification on the sequence of events (or order of events) is critical in reading and translating. Attentiveness to "Ordinal words" such as, - first, second, third, and so on is one important key.

Paying close attention to time words such as, yesterday, last year, before, or next year will also help.

Then is another critical word implying something happened, THEN another thing took place.

Therefore is a word that signals order of event. Something has come before, THEREFORE another thing is being discussed.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

Following the Greek wording, a literal translation of Luke chapter 10 verse 34 would say, 
//**“He [The Samaritan] went to the man that was beaten and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.”**//

This could sound like the Samaritan bandaged the wounds and then poured oil and wine on them or that he did all this at the same time.  To make the order of what happened more clear, you might consider rearranging the phrases in this sentence to read,

//**“The Samaritan went to him, poured oil and wine on his wounds, and put bandages on them.”**//
