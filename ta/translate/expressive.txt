====== Creating Expressive Translations ======

When translating the Bible:

Ensure that any EXPRESSIVE meaning comes across similarly in your language.

  * Determine the meaning of difficult idioms, proverbs and figures of speech and translate them with meaningful expressions in your language.
  * Determine the grounds of comparison for each simile and metaphor.
  * Decide on the purpose of every rhetorical question, those that do not ask for information, before you translate them. Translate them with the same purpose (such as to rebuke, to warn or to show surprise) in your language.
