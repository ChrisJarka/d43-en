\v 8 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out
of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he
renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah.
\v 9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon:
for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.
