But when your descendants humble themselves \f + \ft synecdoche \f* and stop being very stubborn [IDI] and accept being punished for their sins,
\v 42 I will keep in mind the agreement that I made with \add your ancestors\add* Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and \add what I promised to them about Canaan\add* land.

\p
\v 40 And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me,
\v 41 I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;
\v 42 then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
