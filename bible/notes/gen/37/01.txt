<usfm>
\v 1 Jacob continued to live in Canaan land, where his father had lived previously.
\v 2 This is\f + \ft Or: I will now tell you \f* what happened to Jacob's family.
\p When his son Joseph was seventeen years old, he was taking care of the flocks of sheep and goats with some of his older brothers. They were sons of his father's concubines\f + \ft Or: female slaves that he had taken to be his secondary wives \f*. Joseph sometimes told his father about bad things that his brothers were doing.
\p
\v 3 Jacob loved Joseph more than he loved any of his other children, because Joseph had been born when Jacob was an old man. Jacob made for Joseph a long pretty robe that had long sleeves.
\v 4 When Joseph's older brothers realized that their father loved him more than he loved any of them, they hated him. They never spoke kindly to him.
\p
\v 5 One night Joseph had a dream. He told his brothers about the dream.
\v 6 He said to them, "Listen to the dream I had!
\v 7 In the dream, we were tying up bundles of wheat in the field. Suddenly my bundle stood up straight, and surprisingly, your bundles gathered around my bundle and bowed down to it!"
\v 8 His brothers said to him, "Do you think that some day you will rule over us? Are you going to be our king?" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* They hated him even more than before because of what he had told them about his dream.
\p
\v 9 Later he had another dream, and again he told his older brothers about it. He said, "Listen to this! I had another dream. In this dream, the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me!"
\v 10 He also told his father about it. His father rebuked him, saying "What are you suggesting by that dream \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? Do you think it means that your mother and I and your older brothers will some day bow down to the ground in front of you?" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 11 Joseph's older brothers were furious\f + \ft Or: angry \f* with him, but his father just kept thinking about what the dream meant.
\p
\v 12 One day Joseph's older brothers went to take care of their father's sheep and goats that were eating grass near Shechem.
\v 13 Some time later, Jacob said to Joseph, "Your brothers are taking care of the sheep and goats near Shechem \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. I am going to send you there to see them." Joseph replied, "Okay."
\v 14 Jacob said, "Go and see if they are doing okay, and if the flocks are doing okay. Then come back and give me a report." So Jacob sent Joseph from the valley where they were living, the valley where Hebron is located, to go north to find his brothers.
\p When Joseph arrived near Shechem \add city\add*,
\v 15 while he was wandering around in the fields looking\f + \ft Or: searching \f* for his brothers, a man saw him and asked him, "Whom are you looking\f + \ft Or: searching \f* for?"
\v 16 Joseph replied, "I am looking for my older brothers. Can you tell me where they are taking care of their sheep and goats?"
\v 17 The man replied, "They are not here anymore. I heard one of them saying, 'Let's take the sheep and goats and go to Dothan town.'~"

\p So Joseph left there and went north, and found his older brothers near Dothan.
\v 18 But they saw him when he was still far away, and they decided to kill him.
\v 19 They said to each other things like, "Here comes that dreamer!"
\v 20 "Hey, let's kill him, and then throw his body into one of the pits\f + \ft Or: cisterns \f*. Then we will tell people that a ferocious\f + \ft Or: wild \f* animal attacked and killed him and ate him. And then we will find out whether his dreams come true\f + \ft Or: make sure that his dreams do not come true \f*!"
\p
\v 21 Reuben heard what they were saying, so he tried to persuade them not to kill \f + \ft metonymy \f* Joseph. He said, "No, we should not kill him.
\v 22 Do not even shed his blood! We can throw him into this pit\f + \ft Or: cistern \f* in the desert, but we should nor harm him \f + \ft metonymy \f*." He said that, and then left them, planning to rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father.
\p
\v 23 So when Joseph arrived where his older brothers were, they seized him and ripped off his pretty robe with long sleeves.
\v 24 Then they took him and threw him into the pit\f + \ft Or: cistern \f*. But the pit\f + \ft Or: cistern \f* was dry; there was no water in it.
\p
\v 25 After they sat down to eat some food, they looked up and saw a caravan\f + \ft Or: group of travelers \f*, descendants of Ishmael, coming from the Gilead area. Their camels were loaded with bags of spices and nice-smelling resins. They were going down to Egypt to sell those things there.
\v 26 Judah said to his \add older and younger\add* brothers, "If we kill our younger brother and hide his body, what will we gain?\f + \ft Or: we will not gain anything! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 27 So, instead of harming him, let's sell him to these men who are descendants of Ishmael. Don't forget, he is our own younger brother!" So they all agreed to do that.
\p
\v 28 When those traders from the Midian area came near, Joseph's brothers pulled him up out of the pit\f + \ft Or: cistern \f*. Then they sold him to the men from Midian for 20 pieces of silver. The traders then took Joseph to Egypt.
\p
\v 29 When Reuben returned to the pit\f + \ft Or: cistern \f*, he saw that his younger brother was not there. He was so grieved that he tore his clothes.
\v 30 He went back to his \add younger\add* brothers and said, "The boy is not in the pit\f + \ft Or: cistern \f*! What can I do now?" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\p
\v 31 They did not dare to tell their father what they had done. So, they decided to invent a story about what had happened. They got Joseph's robe. Then they killed a goat and dipped the robe in the goat's blood.
\v 32 They took that pretty robe back to their father and said, "We found this robe! Look at it. Is it your son's robe?"
\v 33 He recognized it, and he said, "Yes, it is my son's robe! Some ferocious\f + \ft Or: wild \f* animal must have attacked and killed him! I am sure that the animal has torn Joseph to pieces!"
\p
\v 34 Jacob was so grieved that he tore his clothes. He put on sackcloth\f + \ft Or: clothes that people wear when they are mourning for someone who has died \f*. He mourned, Or: cried for his son for many days.
\v 35 All of his children came to try to comfort him, but he did not pay attention to what they said. He said, "No, I will still be mourning\f + \ft Or: crying \f* when I die and go to be with my son." So Joseph's father continued to cry because of what had happened to his son.
\p
\v 36 In the meantime, the men\f + \ft Or: traders \f* from Midian took Joseph to Egypt and sold him to Potiphar, who was one of the king's officials. He was the captain of the soldiers who protected the king.

*\c 37
*\p
*\v 1 Jacob lived in the land where his father was staying, in the of Canaan.
*\v 2 This is the record of Jacob. Joseph, who was seventeen years old, was guarding the flock with his brothers. He was a youth with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives. Joseph brought an unfavorable  report about them to their father.
*
*
*\v 3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons because he was the son of his old age. He made him a luxurious tunic that reached to his hands and ankles.
*\v 4 His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers. They hated him and would not speak cordially to him.
*
*
*\p
*
*\v 5 Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told his brothers about it. They hated him even more.
*
*\v 6 He said to them, "Please listen to this dream which I dreamed;
*
* 
*
*
*
*\v 7 Behold, we were tying sheaves in the field and behold, my sheaf rose and stood upright, and behold, your sheaves came around and bowed down to my sheaf."
*
*\v 8 His brothers said to him, "Will you really reign over us? Will you actually rule over us?" They hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
*
* 
*
*
*
*\v 9 He dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers. He said, "Look, I have dreamed another dream:  the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me."
*
*\v 10 He told it to his father just as to his brothers, and his father rebuked him. He said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come to bow down to the ground to you?"
*
*\v 11 His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.
*
* 
*
*
*
*\p
*
*\v 12 His brothers went to tend their father’s flock in Shechem.
*
*\v 13 Israel said to Joseph, "Are not your brothers tending the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them." Jacob said to him, "I am ready."
*
*\v 14 He said to him, "Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers and well with the flock, and bring me word." So Jacob sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and Joseph went to Shechem.
*
* 
*
*
*
*\v 15 A certain man found Joseph. Behold, Joseph was wandering in a field. The man asked him, "What do you seek?"
*
*\v 16 Joseph said, "I am seeking my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are guarding the flock?"
*
*\v 17 The man said, "They left this place, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
*
* 
*
*
*
*\p
*
*\v 18 They saw him from a distance, and before he came near to them, they plotted against him to kill him.
*
*\v 19 His brothers said to one another, "Look, this dreamer is approaching.
*
*\v 20 Come now, therefore, let us kill him and cast him into one of the pits. We will say, 'A wild animal has devoured him.' we will see what will become of his dreams."
*
* 
*
*
*
*\v 21 Reuben heard it and rescued him from their hand. He said, "Let us not take his life."
*
*\v 22 Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him" -- that he might rescue him out of their hand to bring him back to his father.
*
* 
*
*
*
*\v 23 It came about that when Joseph reached his brothers, they stripped him of his tunic, the tunic he wore that reached his hands and ankles.
*
*\v 24 They took him and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty with no water in it.
*
* 
*
*
*
*\p
*
*\v 25 They sat down to eat bread. They lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh. They were traveling to carry them down to Egypt.
*
*\v 26 Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
*
* 
*
*
*
*\v 27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands upon him. For he is our brother, our flesh." His brothers listened to him.
*
*\v 28 The Midianite merchants passed by. His brothers drew Joseph up and lifted him up out of the pit. They sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. The Ishmaelites carried Joseph into Egypt.
*
* 
*
*
*
*\p
*
*\v 29 Reuben returned to the pit, and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit. He tore his clothes.
*
*\v 30 He returned to his brothers and said, "Where is the boy? And I, where will I go?"
*
* 
*
*
*
*\v 31 They took Joseph’s coat, slaughtered a goat, and dipped the coat in the blood.
*
*\v 32 They sent the tunic that reached the hands and ankles and took it to their father and said, " We found this. Please see whether it is your son’s tunic or not."
*
*\v 33 Jacob recognized it and said, "It is my son’s tunic. Awild animal has devoured him. Joseph has certainly been torn to pieces."
*
* 
*
*
*
*\v 34 Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth upon his loins. He mourned for his son many days.
*
*\v 35 All his sons and daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, "Indeed I will go down to Sheol mourning for my son." His father wept for him.
*
*\v 36 The Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard.
