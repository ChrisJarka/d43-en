  * Use narration-style approach with natural emotion, rhythm and nuance.
  * Narrator(s) must be a native speaker of language and culturally acceptable for conveying Biblical content.
  * Avoid unnecessary or excessive changing of narrators within a recording. Too many changes can be distracting to the listener. A change of narrator should not occur within a single chapter or story.
  * No sound effects, background music, dramatization, multi-voice acting, theatrical-style voicing or emphasis that suggests a presumed interpretation of the Scripture passage onto listeners.
