\v 51 Neither did Samaria commit half of your sins; but you multiply your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters because of all 
the abominations that you commit!
\v 52 Even you! Lift up your own shame by which you have given judgment for your sisters in your sins when you acted abominably. They now seem 
more righteous than you. Even you! Be ashamed and lift up your disgrace by which you have justified your sisters.
