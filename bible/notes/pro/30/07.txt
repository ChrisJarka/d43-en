<usfm>
\q
\v 7 Two things have I asked of thee;
\q Deny me them not before I die:
\q
\v 8 Remove far from me falsehood and lies;
\q Give me neither poverty nor riches;
\q Feed me with the food that is needful for me:
\q
\v 9 Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is Jehovah?
\q Or lest I be poor, and steal,
\q And use profanely the name of my God.
\b
