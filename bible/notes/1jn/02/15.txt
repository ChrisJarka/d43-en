===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
\v 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
\v 17 And the world passes away, and the lust thereof: but he that does the will of God remains for ever.
