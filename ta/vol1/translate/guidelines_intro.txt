===== The Qualities of a Good Translation =====

This module answers the question: What are the qualities of a good translation?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: ['translation_guidelines']

==== Four Main Qualities ====
There are four main qualities of a good translation. It must be:
  * Clear
  * Accurate
  * Natural
  * Equal
We can think of each of these qualities as a leg of a four-legged stool. Each one is necessary. If one is missing, the stool will not stand. Likewise, each of these qualities must be present in a translation in order for it to be useful and faithful to God's intent. 
==== Accurate ====
Translate accurately, without detracting from, changing, or adding to the meaning of the original text. Translated content should faithfully communicate as precisely as possible the meaning of the original text as it would have been understood by the original audience. Translate with the meaning of the text in mind and communicate accurately implicit information, unknown concepts and figures of speech. 
==== Clear ====
Use whatever language structures are necessary to achieve the highest level of comprehension. This includes simplifying concepts, rearranging the form of a text, and using as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as accurately as possible. 
==== Natural ====
Use language forms that are effective and that reflect the way your language is used in corresponding contexts. 
==== Equal ====
Communicate the same intent as the source text. As much as possible, maintain the literary forms in the original text, including narrative, poetry, exhortation, and prophecy, representing them with corresponding forms that communicate in a similar way in your language.
