\v 25 You are afraid of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his huge army, because they are wanting to kill you. I will enable them to capture you.
\v 26 I will expel you and your mother \add from this land\add*, and you will be taken to another country. Neither of you were born there, but you will both die there.

\v 24 As I live, says Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would
I pluck you thence;
\v 25 and I will give you into the hand of them that seek your life, and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid, even
into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\v 26 And I will cast you out, and your mother that bare you, into another country, where you were not born; and there shall you
die.
