====== Active or Passive ======

The English language has both the active and passive forms of speech.

  * In the **ACTIVE**  form, the subject does the action and is always mentioned.
  * In the **PASSIVE**  form, the action is done to the subject and the one who does the action is //not always//  mentioned.

All languages have active forms. Some languages have passive forms, and some do not. 

The passive form is not used for the same reasons in all of the languages that have it.

Examples of Active and Passive Sentences. We have underlined the subject in the examples below.

ACTIVE: __My father__  built the house in 2010. \\ PASSIVE: __The house__  was built by my father in 2010. \\ PASSIVE: __The house__  was built in 2010. (This does not tell who did the action.)

=== Purposes for the passive: ===

  * The speaker is talking about the person or thing the action was done to, not about the person who did the action.
  * The speaker does not want to tell who did the action. 
  * The speaker does not know who did the action.

===== Translation Principles Regarding Passive =====

  * Translators whose language does not use passive forms will need to find another way to express the idea. 
  * Translators whose language has passive forms will need to understand why the passive is used in a particular sentence in the Bible and decide whether or not to use a passive form for that purpose in his translation of the sentence.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

If you decide that it is best to translate without a passive form, then there are three possibilities.

  - Use the same verb in an active sentence and tell who or what did the action.
  - Use the same verb in an active sentence, and do not tell who or what did the action.
  - Use a different verb.

===== Examples from the Bible of Translations Suggestions =====
1. Use the same verb in an active sentence and tell who did the action. 

Passive: //A loaf of bread __was given__ him every day from the street of the bakers// Jeremiah 37:21

  * __The king's servants gave__ Jeremiah a loaf of bread every day from the street of the bakers  

2. Use the same verb in an active sentence, and do not tell who did the action. Instead use a generic expression like "they" or "people" or “someone.”  

Passive: //It would be better for him if a millstone __were put__ around his neck and he __were thrown__ into the sea//  Luke 17:1-2 

  * It would be better for him if __they were to put__ a millstone around his neck and __throw__ him into the sea 
  * It would be better for him if __someone were to put__ a heavy stone around his neck and __throw__ him into the sea.

3. Use a different verb  

Passive: //A loaf of bread __was given__ him every day from the street of the bakers,// Jeremiah 37:21   
  * He __received__ a loaf of bread every day from the street of the bakers 

Passive:  //“Already the ax __has been placed__ against the root of the trees."//  Luke 3:9 
  * Already the ax is against the root of the trees.

The English language has the active and passive forms of speech.\\
* In the **ACTIVE** form, the subject does the action and is always mentioned.\\
* In the **PASSIVE** form, the action is done to the subject and is //not always// mentioned.\\
Some languages have both the passive and active forms; however, the language does not use them in the same way.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

**Consider carefully how to best use the forms in your language before using the passive form wherever the English language does.**

   * Many languages do not have a passive form, only the active form exists. Therefore, it may be necessary to turn a sentence from the passive form into the active form.
  * To change a passive form to an active form it will be necessary to explain who did the action.
  * Consider why the passive form was used in the verse. There should be ways of achieving the same effect in the translation.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Luke 3:9 //"Already the ax has been placed against the root of the trees. So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire"// \\ **every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down**  - This is a passive clause. It can be translated with an active clause “He chops down every tree that does not produce good fruit.”

Luke 17:1-2 //Jesus said to his disciples, "It is certain that things that cause sin will come, but woe to him through whom they come! It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble."// \\ **if a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown**  - This could also be translated with active clauses: “if they were to put a millstone around his neck and throw him” or “if someone were to put a heavy stone around his neck and push him.”

===== Examples from English =====

**Active**  - Peter built the house. **Passive**  - The house was built by Peter. \\ **Active**  - Worms ate the apple. **Passive**  - The apple was eaten by worms.
