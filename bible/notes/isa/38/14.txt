===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 \add I was delirious, and\add* I chirped like a swift or a swallow,
\q2 and moaned like a dove.
\q1 My eyes became tired looking up toward heaven for help.
\q2 I cried out, 'Yahweh, help me, because I am distressed!'
\b
\q1
\v 15 But there was really nothing\f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that I could say and ask him to reply to me,
\q2 because it was Yahweh who sent this illness.
\q1 So now I will live humbly during my \add remaining\add* years
\q2 because I am very anguished in my soul.
\q1

\q1
\v 14 Like a swallow I chirp; I coo like a dove; 
\q1 my eyes grow tired with looking upward. O Lord, I am oppressed; help me.
\q1
\v 15 What shall I say? He has both spoken to me, and has done it;
\q1 I will walk slowly all my years because my soul is overcome with grief.
