In order to understand this module, it would be good to read
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

Merism is when a speaker makes a single idea more forceful by connecting two nouns or adjectives with “and” when one of the words actually describes the other.

===== Description =====

Merism is when a speaker makes a single idea more forceful by connecting two nouns or adjectives with “and” when one of the words actually describes the other.

**in heaven or in earth** (Deuteronomy 3:24)\\
"Heaven" and "earth" include everything that exists.

**Reason this is a translation issue**\\
Some readers may think that the phrase only applies to the items mentioned and not to items not mentioned.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**From the __rising__ of the sun to its __setting__, Yahweh's name should be praised.** (Psalm 113:3)\\
This sentence is a merism because it refers to when and where the sun rises, when and where the sun sets, and all the time and places between the two.

**They will __stagger__ __from sea to sea__; they will __run__ __from the north to the east__ to seek the word of Yahweh** (Amos 8:12)\\
This sentence contains two merisms. "Stagger" and "run" are a merism because "stagger" is the slowest a person can move on foot, while "run" is the fastest. Included are those who simply walk or move by other means.\\
"From sea to sea" and "from the north to the east" form another merism because a person standing at Bethel, where Amos was preaching, would look south to the Dead Sea, west to the Mediterranean Sea, then north, then east. That is, he would look in all directions.

===== Translation Strategies =====

If leaving the merism in would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider doing so. If not, here are other options:
  - State specifically what the merism includes.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. State specifically what the merism includes.

  * **From the __rising__ of the sun to its __setting__, Yahweh's name should be praised.** (Psalm 113:3)
    * "At all times and in all places, people should praise Yahweh."

  * **They will __stagger__ __from sea to sea__; they will __run__ __from the north to the east__ to seek the word of Yahweh** (Amos 8:12)
    * "They will go about from everywhere in all directions to seek the word of Yahweh"
