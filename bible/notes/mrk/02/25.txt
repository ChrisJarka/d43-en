\v 25 \add Jesus wanted to show them that the record in the Scriptures indicated that God permitted people to disobey certain religious laws when they needed food\add*. So he said to them, "\add It is written in the Scriptures\add* what \add our revered ancestor, King\add* David, did when he needed food, and both he and the men with him were hungry. You have read about that, but \add you do not think about what it implies.\f + \ft Or: why do you not think about what it implies\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 26 During the time Abiathar was high priest, David entered the big tent \add where people worshipped\add* God \add and asked for some bread. The high priest gave him some\add* of the loaves of bread. That bread was the bread he had presented to God. It was permitted in one of Moses' laws that only the priests could eat that bread! But David ate some of it. Then he also gave some of it to the men who were with him. \add But God did not consider that was wrong!\add*"

\v 26 During the time Abiathar was high priest, David entered the house of God and asked for some bread. The high priest gave him some of the bread that had been on display before God.
