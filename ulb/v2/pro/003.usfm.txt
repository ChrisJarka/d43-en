\c 3
\q
\v 1 My son, forget not my law;
\q But let your heart keep my commandments:
\q
\v 2 For length of days, and years of life,
\q And peace, will they add to thee.
\q
\v 3 Let not kindness and truth forsake thee:
\q Bind them about your neck;
\q Write them upon the tablet of your heart:
\q
\v 4 So shall you find favor and good understanding
\q In the sight of God and man.
\q
\v 5 Trust in Jehovah with all your heart,
\q And lean not upon your own understanding:
\q
\v 6 In all your ways acknowledge him,
\q And he will direct your paths.
\q
\v 7 Be not wise in your own eyes;
\q Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:
\q
\v 8 It will be health to your navel,
\q And marrow to your bones.
\q
\v 9 Honor Jehovah with your substance,
\q And with the first fruits of all your increase:
\q
\v 10 So shall your barns be filled with plenty,
\q And your vats shall overflow with new wine.
\q
\v 11 My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah;
\q Neither be weary of his reproof:
\q
\v 12 For whom Jehovah loves he reproveth,
\q Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
\b
\q
\v 13 Happy is the man that finds wisdom,
\q And the man that gets understanding.
\q
\v 14 For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver,
\q And the profit thereof than fine gold.
\q
\v 15 She is more precious than rubies:
\q And none of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.
\q
\v 16 Length of days is in her right hand;
\q In her left hand are riches and honor.
\q
\v 17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
\q And all her paths are peace.
\q
\v 18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her:
\q And happy is every one that retaineth her.
\q
\v 19 Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth;
\q By understanding he established the heavens.
\q
\v 20 By his knowledge the depths were broken up,
\q And the skies drop down the dew.
\q
\v 21 My son, let them not depart from your eyes;
\q Keep sound wisdom and discretion:
\q
\v 22 So shall they be life to your soul,
\q And grace to your neck.
\q
\v 23 Then shall you walk in your way securely,
\q And your foot shall not stumble.
\q
\v 24 When you lie down, you shall not be afraid:
\q Yea, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.
\q
\v 25 Be not afraid of sudden fear,
\q Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh:
\q
\v 26 For Jehovah will be your confidence,
\q And will keep your foot from being taken.
\b
\q
\v 27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due,
\q When it is in the power of your hand to do it.
\q
\v 28 Say not to your neighbor, Go, and come again,
\q And to-morrow I will give;
\q When you have it by thee.
\q
\v 29 Devise not evil against your neighbor,
\q Seeing he lives securely by thee.
\q
\v 30 Strive not with a man without cause,
\q If he have done you no harm.
\q
\v 31 Envy you not the man of violence,
\q And choose none of his ways.
\q
\v 32 For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah;
\q But his friendship is with the upright.
\q
\v 33 The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked;
\q But he blesses the habitation of the righteous.
\q
\v 34 Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers;
\q But he gives grace to the lowly.
\q
\v 35 The wise shall inherit glory;
\q But shame shall be the promotion of fools.
