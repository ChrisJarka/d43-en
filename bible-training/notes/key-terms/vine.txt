====== vine ======


===== Definition: =====


A vine is a plant with long flexible stems. As these stems grow they either creep along the ground or climb up other plants or structures. The word "vine" in the Bible usually refers to grape vines.

    * Branches grow along the stems of the vines and get their strength from the nutrients flowing through the vine. Jesus called himself the vine and his people the branches. In this case, the word "vine" could also be translated as "vine stem" or "stem."
    * Vine can also be translated as "climber."
