=== What is the Book of Acts about? ===

The Book of Acts tells the story of the growth and development of the early church. It shows the Holy Spirit guiding and helping early Christians. The book describes the growth of the church for about thirty years after Jesus' ascension into heaven. It shows the power of God and the Holy Spirit, at work in the early church. 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "The Acts of the Apostles." Translators may choose to modify this title as, for example, "The Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles." 

=== Who wrote the Book of Acts? ===

This book does not give the reader the name of the author. Since early Christian times, however, it has generally been believed that the author was Luke because he was the only person who could be included in the passages using the word "we." Luke was a medical doctor; his way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile who was friendly to Judaism, but he was probably not a convert to Judaism. Although he was not an eyewitness to the ministry of Jesus, he did see many of the events that he describes in the Book of Acts.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is the [[:en:obe:kt:church|Church]]? ===

The Book of Acts begins a new era in the religious history of mankind. God is no longer concerned with proper worship governed by the temple in Jerusalem. Instead, he shifts his focus from the nation of Israel to the Church, which is all those who believe in Christ. The remainder of the New Testament, after the Book of Acts, will now focus on righteous living through the Holy Spirit's power. 


===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====


=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Acts? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of more accurate manuscripts. The following passages contain the most significant issues in the Book of Acts:\\

_<del>_  * "Then an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground." (22:43–44) 
  * "For he was required to release one prisoner during the feast." (23:17) (so noted in ULB)
  * "Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." (23:34)__</del>


Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to Acts.
