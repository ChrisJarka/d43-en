\v 13-14 "Going to live forever with God in heaven is difficult; it is like a difficult road that you should take.
There is another road, one that most people take. That road is wide; they walk on until they reach a wide gate, but when they go through it, they will die.  
So I am telling you to take the difficult road and enter the narrow gate to live forever with God in heaven."
