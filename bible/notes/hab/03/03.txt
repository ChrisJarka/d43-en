===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Habakkuk begins to describe his vision of Yahweh coming to judge his enemies and to save his people. The vision continues through [[:en:bible:notes:hab:03:14|3:15]]. It is full of metaphorical language and uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran** - Teman and Mount Paran were both located south of Judah. Habakkuk speaks of God coming to Judah from the direction of Mount Sinai.
  * **His glory covered the heavens** - "His splendor covered the sky." Here the word "glory" refers to the bright light that biblical writers often associate with God's presence. 
  * **the earth was full of his praise** - Here the word "praise" is a metonym for God's qualities that cause people to praise him. AT: "the earth was full of his glory" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
