====== Key Terms: Link and Page Master ======
**note:** This page and job description has been revised to current procedures (8Jan15).


===== Procedures =====

  - The Key Term Link and Page Master (LPM) will handle the hyperlink and page creation as necessary.
  - Creation of pages will normally be tagged as "create" following the template specified on this page. See templates.
  - Each week "create" tagged key term pages will be promoted to "draft" as those pages are needed to support the Notes Teams efforts.
  - It is up to the KT team leader to promote pages from "draft"  to "publish"
  - At "publish" stage, a check will be made to create all x-ref hyperlinks and remove the "ktlink" tag.

==== Pagename (urlname) naming conventions ====

The key term pagename (urlname) naming convention is:
  - for a single word, the pagename is the key term in lower case letters.
  - for a multi-word phrase, the pagename is the words without spaces, hyphens, or other breaks (ex: kingdomofJudah).

==== Create KT Pages ====
  - create a new kt page with the following link: %%https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/key-terms/urlname%% 
  - enter edit mode and copy one of the two templates listed below into the new key term edit window.
  - edit the header to the full key term name
  - edit the line %%{{topic>URLterm&nocomments}}%% by changing "URLterm" to the pagename (urlname).
  - determine if the KT is to be tagged "create" or "draft"
    - If this KT is to be tagged "create" delete the Line %%{{tag>draft ktlink}}%% and edit the line %%{{tag>create BIBnn ktlink}}%% to the bible reference that this first discovered. Example: %%{{tag>create gen01 ktlink}}%%
    - If this KT is to be tagged "draft" delete the line %%{{tag>create BIBnn ktlink}}%%.


==== Create cross references (hyperlinks) ====

  - After the key term has been promoted to "publish" check for cross references that need to be converted into links. Example (See also: Adam, Eve)
  - Find the pagename (urlname) of the Key term on %%https://www.door43.org/en/bible/admin-reports/00-key-term-and-tag-names%%
  - substitute the name with the follow link syntax %%[[:en:bible:notes:key-terms:urlname]]%%. Example: Adam will become [[:en:bible:notes:key-terms:adam|adam]] and Eve will become [[:en:bible:notes:key-terms:eve|eve]]. the full hyperlink will be: 
      - %%(See also: [[:en:bible:notes:key-terms:Adam|Adam]], [[:en:bible:notes:key-terms:Eve|Eve]])%%
