===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He will speak words against the Most High** - This means that the newest king will openly disagree with the Most High. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_123person]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **He will try ... into his hand** - This refers to the newest king, not the Most High.
  * **change feasts and the Law** - Both terms refer to the Law of Moses. The feasts were an important part of the religion of Israel in the Old Testament.
  * **These things will be given into his hand** - AT: "The newest king will control the religous festivals and laws" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **one year, two years, and half a year** - This is three and a half year (UDB), but this is not the normal way the Israelites counted. If possible, try to translate in a way that preserves this uncommon way of counting. AT: "1 year, 2 years, and 6 months"
  * **But the court will be in session**  - "Then the court will be in session" See how you translated the key terms of this metaphor in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:07:10|7:10]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and they will take ... destroyed at the end** - AT: "and the members of the court will take the royal power away from the newest king, and in the end they will consume and destroy him"
