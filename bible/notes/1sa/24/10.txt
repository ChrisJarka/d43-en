====== 1 Samuel 24:10-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Today you can see with your own eyes that \add what they say is not true\add*. Yahweh put you in a place where I and my men could have killed you when you were in this cave. Some of my men told me that I should do that, but I did not allow them to do that. I said to them, 'I will not harm my master, because he is the king whom Yahweh appointed.'
\v 11 Your majesty, look at this piece of your robe that is in my hand! I cut it from your robe, but I did not kill you. So now you should be able to understand that I am not planning to do anything evil to you. I have not done anything wrong to you, but you are searching for me to kill me.

\v 10 Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that Jehovah had delivered you today into my hand in the cave: and some bade
me kill thee; but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Jehovahâ€™s anointed.
\v 11 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and
killed you not, know you and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you,
yough you huntest after my life to take it.
