\c 23

\v 1 And they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing-floors.
\v 2 Therefore David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and strike these Philistines? And Jehovah said to David, Go, and
strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.
\v 3 And David’s men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the
armies of the Philistines?
\v 4 Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver
the Philistines into your hand.
\v 5 And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and killed them with a
great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
\v 6 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his
hand.
\p
\v 7 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in,
by entering into a town that has gates and bars.
\v 8 And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
\v 9 And David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
\v 10 Then said David, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to
destroy the city for my sake.
\v 11 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O Jehovah, the God of
Israel, I beseech thee, tell your servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down.
\v 12 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah said, They will
deliver you up.
\v 13 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could
go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.
\v 14 And David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And
Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
\p
\v 15 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.
\v 16 And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
\v 17 And he said to him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and you shall be king over Israel,
and I shall be next to thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
\v 18 And they two made a covenant before Jehovah: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
\p
\v 19 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood,
in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?
\v 20 Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver
him up into the king’s hand.
\v 21 And Saul said, Blessed be you of Jehovah; for you have had compassion on me.
\v 22 Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is,
and who has seen him there; for it is told me that he deals very subtly.
\v 23 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hides himself, and come you again to me of a
certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the
thousands of Judah.
\p
\v 24 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the
south of the desert.
\v 25 And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the
wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
\v 26 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to
get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
\v 27 But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.
\v 28 So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place
Sela-hammahlekoth.
\v 29 And David went up from thence, and lived in the strongholds of En-gedi.
