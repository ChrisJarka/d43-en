\v 7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay, so that it is clear that the surpassing power belongs to God, and not from us;
\v 8 we are afflicted in every way, but not overwhelmed. We are perplexed but not filled with despair;
\v 9 persecuted but not forsaken; struck down but not destroyed.
\v 10 We always carry in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be shown in our bodies.
