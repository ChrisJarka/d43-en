===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 21 Were you called being a bondservant? Do not be concerned about it. But if you can become free, it is even better. . \v 22 For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise he that was called being free, is Christ’s bondservant. \v 23 You were bought with a price. Do not become bondservants of men. \v 24 Brothers, in whatever condition each man was called, let him remain in that condition with God. </usfm>
