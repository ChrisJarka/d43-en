\v 7 When you file lawsuits between one another it is a huge defeat for you. Why not allow a brother or sister to take advantage of you, rather than parade the matter before an unbelieving judge? Why not rather be cheated, than to bring the matter before a civil court? The victory that could have been yours is lost to defeat when you sue each another.
\v 8 The real loss came when you wronged and cheated each other in the first place, and you did that to your own brothers and sisters.

\v 7 The fact that there are any lawsuits at all between Christians is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer the wrong? Why not rather allow yourselves to be cheated?
\v 8 But you have wronged and cheated others, and these are your own brothers and sisters!
