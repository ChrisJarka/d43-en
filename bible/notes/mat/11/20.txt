\v 20 \add The people, who lived in\add* the towns \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add in the area where Jesus was, saw him\add* perform many miracles. But they did not turn away from their sinful behavior. So Jesus began to reproach them \add by saying to them\add*,
\v 21 "You \add people who live in\add* Chorazin \add city\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* and you \add people who live in\add* Bethsaida \add city\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* will suffer terribly in hell! \add I\add* did great miracles in your \add cities, but you did not turn from your sinful behavior\add*. If the miracles that I performed in your \add cities\add* had been done in \add the ancient cities of\add* Tyre and Sidon, the \add wicked people who lived there\add* long ago would have sat in ashes, wearing coarse cloth \add to show that they were sorry for their sins\add*.
\v 22 So note this: \add God will punish the wicked people who lived in the cities of\add* Tyre and Sidon \f + \ft metonymy \f*, but he will punish you even more severely on the final day when he judges \add all people\add*.
\v 23 I \add also have something to say to\add* you \add people who live in\add* Capernaum \add city\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Do not \add think that\add* you will be honored \f + \ft Or:that\add God\add* will honor you \f* in heaven!\f + \ft Or: Do you think that you will be honored \f + \ft Or:that\add God\add* will honor you \f* in heaven? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add That will not happen! On the contrary\add*, \add after you die, you will be sent\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will send you \f* down into the place where \add sinful people\add* will be punished \f + \ft Or:he will punish sinful people \f* \add forever\add*! \add God destroyed the ancient city of\add* Sodom \add because the people who lived in that city were extremely wicked\add*. If I had performed in \add Sodom the miracles that I performed in your city, the people there would have turned away from their wicked behavior and\add* their \add city\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* would still exist now \f + \ft metonymy \f*. But you, \add although I did miracles in your city, did not turn from your wicked behavior\add*.
\v 24 So note this: \add God\add* will punish \add the people who lived in\add* Sodom \add city\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, but he will punish you \add even\add* more severely on the final day when \add he\add* judges \add all people\add*."

\v 20 The people, who lived in the towns in the area where Jesus was, saw him perform many miracles. But they did not turn away from their sinful behavior. So Jesus began to rebuke them by saying to them,
\v 21 "You people who live in the city of Chorazin and you in the city of Bethsaida, how terribly you will suffer! I did great miracles in your cities, but you did not stop sinning. If I had done these things in the cities of Tyre and Sidon of long ago, those wicked people would certainly have stopped sinning; they would have put on rough clothing and sat in the cold ashes of their fires, so sorry they would have been.
\v 22 Let me tell you this: God will punish the wicked people who lived in the cities of Tyre and Sidon, but he will punish you even more severely on the final day when he judges all people.
\v 23 I also have something to say to you people who live in the city of Capernaum. Do you think that others will praise you so much that you will go right up to heaven? That will not happen! On the
contrary, you will go down to where God punishes people after they die! 
If I had done these same miracles in Sodom of long ago, those wicked people would certainly have stopped sinning, and their city would have been here even today. But you have not stopped sinning.
\v 24 Let me tell you this: God will punish the wicked people who lived in Sodom, but he will punish you even more severely on the final day when he judges all people."

\v 20 Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his great deeds were done, because they had not repented. 
\v 21 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which
were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you.
\v 23 You, Capernaum, do you think you will be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to hades; for if in Sodom there had been done the great deeds that were done in you, it would still have remained until today.
\v 24 But I say to you that it shall be easier for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you."
