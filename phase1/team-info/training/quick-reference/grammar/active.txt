====== Passive Verbs ======


===== Description =====

The English language has the active and passive forms of speech.

  * In the **ACTIVE** form, the subject does the action.
  * In the **PASSIVE** form, the action is done to the subject.

Active verbs are normal for language. Passive verbs, however, are not found in all languages, and may require explanatory notes.
