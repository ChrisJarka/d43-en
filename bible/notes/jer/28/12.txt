\v 12 The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from upon the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, and said,
\v 13 “Go and speak to Hananiah and say, ‘Thus says Yahweh: you broke a yoke of wood, but have made instead a yoke of iron!
\v 14 For thus says Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel:  I have set a yoke of iron on the neck of all of these nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and they will serve him!  
I have also given him the living things of the field.’”
