\v 10 Yahweh says this, 'In this place about which you are now saying, "It is desolate, a place with neither man nor beast," in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate having neither man nor beast, there will be heard again
\v 11 the sound of joy and the sound of gladness, the sound of the groom and the sound of the bride, the sound of those who say, while they bring thank offerings to the house of Yahweh, "Give thanks to Yahweh of hosts, for Yahweh is good, and his unfailing love lasts forever!" For I will restore the fortunes of the land to what they were before,' says Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It is desolate, a place with neither man nor beast," in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate having neither man nor beast** - These two lines share similar meanings and emphasize that Judah has become desolate. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **the house of Yahweh** - the temple in Jerusalem
  * **I will restore the fortunes of the land** - The word "land" is a metonym for the people who live on the land. AT: "I will again cause things to go well for the people who live on the land" or "I will cause the people who live on the land to live well again." See how similar words are translated in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:29:12|29:14]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to what they were before** - "as I did when the Israelites first came into this land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
