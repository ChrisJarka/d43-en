\v 26 My fellow believers, remember what \add kind of people you\add* were when God chose you. \add Not many of you\add* whom he chose are people whom \add unbelievers considered to be\add* wise. Very few of you were considered to be important. Very few of you came from families with a high social standing.
\v 27 Instead, it was \add usually\add* those whom \add unbelievers considered to be\add* foolish whom God chose. He did that in order to shame\f + \ft Or: discredit \f* those whom \add unbelievers consider\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise. It was \add usually\add* those \add whom unbelievers\add* considered \f + \ft irony \f* unimportant whom God chose, in order to shame\f + \ft Or: discredit \f* those whom unbelievers consider important.

\v 26 Brothers and sisters, look at where you were when God called you. You weren't the wisest of people at all. No one would say of you that you directed the masses and that people did what you told them. No one was impressed by your regal heritage or impressive lineage.
\v 27 Instead, God chose the things that made no sense to the world to break the world's pride. God chose to use the fragile and easily broken to crush what the world sees as mighty.

\v 26 Look at Gods' calling on you, brothers. Not many of you were wise according to human standards; not many of you were powerful;  not many of you were of noble birth.
\v 27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
