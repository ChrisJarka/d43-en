\v 11 Only a person himself \f + \ft Or: a person's spirit \f* knows what he is thinking. Similarly, only God's Spirit knows what God is thinking.

<usfm>
\v 10 It was by the work of the Spirit that God made these things known to us. For the Spirit sees and knows everything; he even knows the deepest and hidden secrets that only God can know about himself.
\v 11 Who understands the thoughts within a person except the spirit of the person who is within him? So it is that no one knows the deepest things hidden within the person of God, except the Spirit of God himself.
