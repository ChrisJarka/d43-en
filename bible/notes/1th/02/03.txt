<usfm>
\v 3 When we exhorted\f + \ft Or: urged \f* \f + \ft Or: tried to convince \f* \add you to obey God's message\add*, we did not speak to you an untrue message. Instead, we spoke a true message. We do not \add want to get something for ourselves\add* by immoral means. We do not try to deceive \add you or other people\add*.
\v 4 On the contrary, we tell God's message because he trusted us to do that, because he examined us and considered us\add to be acceptable to tell people\add* the message about Christ. As we teach people, we do not say what they like to hear. Instead, \add we say what\add* God \add wants us to say, because\add* he examines everything that we think and what we desire.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 When we encouraged you to obey God's message, we did not speak to you something false. And we do not want to get something for ourselves by immoral means. We do not try to deceive you or anyone else.
\v 4 On the contrary, God trusted us to tell you the Good News, because he had examined us and considered us to be the right people to do this work. As we teach people, we do not say what they like to hear. Instead, we say what God wants us to say, because he judges everything that we think.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 For our exhortation is not from error, nor from impurity, nor from deceit,
\v 4 but just as we have been approved by God to be trusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please men, but God, who examines our hearts.
