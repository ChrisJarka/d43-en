====== Lord God ======

===== Facts: =====

The terms "Lord God" and "the Lord" are titles that refer to God.

  * The word "lord" means someone who has ownership or authority over people. God is the ultimate authority who created everything and rules over everything.
  * Many Bible versions use the term "Lord" or "LORD" to translate the word for God's personal name, "Yahweh," meaning "I am" or some variation of that. This is because sometime after the Old Testament was written, the Jews became so afraid of mispronouncing God's holy name that they stopped saying the name Yahweh and said "Lord" instead.
  * Those who wrote the New Testament did not write "Yahweh God". Instead, they wrote "the Lord God" or "the Lord our God."

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * In the Old Testament, the word translated in English as "Lord" can be translated as "Yahweh God" or "the God, Yahweh."
  * In both the Old and New Testaments it can also be translated as, "the Lord God" or "God, the Lord."
  * Make sure it is clear that names "Yahweh" and "Yahweh God" in the Old Testament refer to the same God as the titles "the Lord" or "the Lord God" in the New Testament.
