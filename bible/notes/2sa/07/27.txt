\v 27 For thou, O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, I will build you a house:
therefore has your servant found in his heart to pray this prayer to thee.
\v 28 And now, O Lord Jehovah, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good thing to your servant:
\v 29 now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you; for thou,
O Lord Jehovah, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your servant be blessed for ever.
