====== Daniel ======

===== Facts: =====

Daniel was an Old Testament prophet who was taken captive into Babylon during Israel's captivity about 600 BC.

  * Daniel was promoted within Babylon when he correctly interpreted King Nebuchadnezzar's first dream as a revelation given by God of the future of Babylon and succeeding future kingdoms.
  * While in captivity, Daniel was given the Babylonian name Belteshazzar.
  * A law was created by Daniel's enemies in Babylon that stated anyone bowing before any god other than the king shall be thrown into a lions' den. Predictably, Daniel bowed before the one true God, and was then thrown into the lions' den, but God delivered Daniel from death or injury.
