\v 19 because what happens to people happens to animals. Animals die, and people die. We all must breathe \add to remain alive\add*. People have no advantage over animals \add in that\add*, so I have a difficult time in understanding that.
\v 20 People and animals all die and are buried. We are all made of soil, and \add when we die\add*, our corpses become soil again.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 For that which happens to the sons of men happens to beasts; even one thing happens to them: as the one dies, so dies the
other; they have all one breath; and man has no advantage above the beasts: for all is vapor.
\v 20 All go to one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
</usfm>
