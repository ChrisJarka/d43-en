\v 3 At some time in the future many people will say, "All is peaceful and we are safe!" Then suddenly God will come to punish them severely! Just as a pregnant woman who experiences birth pains cannot stop those pains, those people will have no way to escape from God.

\v 1 Now concerning the times and seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.
\v 2 For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the Lord is coming like a thief in the night.
\v 3 When they say, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman, and they will in no way escape.
