======  Matthew 01 General Notes ======


=== Formatting in this chapter ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of verse 23, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Genealogy ==
A genealogy is a list which records a person's ancestors or descendants. They were very important in determining a king because the king's authority was usually passed down or inherited from his father. It was also common for an important person to have a recorded genealogy.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Passive Voice == 

The [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Passive Voice]] is used very purposefully in this chapter to indicate that Jesus was not conceived through a sexual relationship. Joseph and Mary were chosen by God to be the "parents" who raised Jesus on earth. Because Jesus did not share any biological traits with Joseph, many scholars have chosen to use the word "incarnation" to refer to God becoming man when Jesus was born. Here, the passive voice emphasizes the Holy Spirit as the subject of the action of conception. Because many languages do not have a passive voice, translators must decide how to best translate these theological nuances.
