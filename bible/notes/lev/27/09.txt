\v 9 If someone solemnly promises to give an animal that is acceptable to be an offering to me, that animal becomes sacred \add and belongs to me\add*.
\v 10 The person who promised to give it must not give another animal instead of the one that he promised; he must not substitute a bad one for a good one or even a better one than the one offered. If he would substitute one for the other, both animals would belong to me.

\v 9 And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation to Jehovah, all that any man gives of such to Jehovah shall be holy.
\v 10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.
