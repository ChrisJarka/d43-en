\v 17 Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about:
thirty chambers were upon the pavement.
\v 18 And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.
\v 19 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court without, a
hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north.
