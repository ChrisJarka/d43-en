\v 8 The person \add who first preaches God's message to people and the one who later teaches them more of God's message\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* both are \add trying to reach the\add* same \add goal\add*\f + \ft Or: have the same \add purpose\add* \f*. And \add God\add* will reward each of them according to how they served him.
\v 9 Remember that Apollos and I are both working together for God. \add You do not belong to us\add*. Just like a field \add belongs to its owner, not to those who work in it\add*, you belong to God, \add not to us who work for him\add*.


\p Also, a house belongs to its owner. \add It does not belong to the man who built it. Similarly, God is the one to whom you belong\add*.
