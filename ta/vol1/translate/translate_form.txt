Before you start this module have you learned about: ['translate_fandm', 'translate_process']

The meaning of a text is the most crucial element. However, the form of the text is also very important. It is more than just a "container" for the meaning. It affects the way the meaning is understood and received. 
We need to examine the "form" of the biblical text. Who wrote it? Who received it? In what situation was it written? Which words and phrases were chosen and why? Is there anything special about the emotional tone or the order of the words? The components of the form affect the meaning of the text. 
==== Culture Affects Meaning ====
The meaning of forms is determined by culture. The same form might have different meanings in different cultures.
In translation, the meaning must remain the same. However, the form of the text must change to fit the culture. The form includes the language of the text. Of course, the language is only one element that makes up the form of the text.  There are many other ways in which the form of the text affects the meaning.
