\c 108
\d A Song, A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 My heart is fixed, O God;
\q I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.
\q
\v 2 Awake, lute and harp:
\q I myself will awake right early.
\q
\v 3 I will give thanks to thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples;
\q And I will sing praises to you among the nations.
\q
\v 4 For your lovingkindness is great above the heavens;
\q And your truth reaches to the skies.
\q
\v 5 Be you exalted, O God, above the heavens,
\q And your glory above all the earth.
\q
\v 6 That your beloved may be delivered,
\q Save with your right hand, and answer us.
\q
\v 7 God has spoken in his holiness: I will exult;
\q I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
\q
\v 8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
\q Ephraim also is the defence of my head;
\q Judah is my sceptre.
\q
\v 9 Moab is my washpot;
\q Upon Edom will I cast my shoe;
\q Over Philistia will I shout.
\q
\v 10 Who will bring me into the fortified city?
\q Who has led me to Edom?
\q
\v 11 Hast not you cast us off, O God?
\q And you go not forth, O God, with our hosts.
\q
\v 12 Give us help against the adversary;
\q For vain is the help of man.
\q
\v 13 Through God we shall do valiantly:
\q For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
