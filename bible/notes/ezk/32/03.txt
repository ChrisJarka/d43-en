===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to compare Pharaoh with a monster that lives in the water.

  * **So I will spread my net over you in the assembly of many peoples** -  This can be translated as "So I will gather many peoples and I will throw my net  over you." Yahweh is speaking to Pharaoh who is like a monster in the water.
  * **and they will lift you up in my net** - It is implied that the peoples are pulling the monster out of the water. Alternate translation: "and using my net, the peoples will pull you up out of the water." (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **I will abandon you in the land** – "I will leave helpless on the land." The monster that was scary when it was in the water, is helpless when it is left on dry land. 
  * **all the birds of heaven** – "all the birds that fly in the sky"
  * **to settle** - "to land" or "stay for a long time." The birds landed on the monster and stayed there for a long time because the were eating the monster.
