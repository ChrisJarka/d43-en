<usfm>
\q
\v 3 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,
\q The moon and the stars, which you have ordained;
\q
\v 4 What is man, that you are mindful of him?
\q And the son of man, that you visit him?
\q
\v 5 For you have made him but little lower than God,
\q And crownest him with glory and honor.
