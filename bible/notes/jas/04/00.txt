=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Adultery ==
Adultery is a common [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]] in Scripture. It is always used negatively and indicates a child of God is acting in an [[:en:obe:kt:ungodly|ungodly]] manner.

== Law ==
It is unclear whether this is a reference to the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Moses]]. It is probably a reference to the "law" of God in general. This is the general standard of [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]] based on the character of God.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
James uses many [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|rhetorical questions]] as a way to teach his readers.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "The humble" ==
This is probably not a reference to those who act humbly, but a reference to those who humble themselves and trust in Jesus for their [[:en:obe:kt:salvation|salvation]].
