=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

You will notice that this chapter refers to various places in land of Israel (i.e. Gilgal, Bethel, Beersheba). Normally these places have good connotations but here they are referred negatively. This is most likely because these cities had become havens for idol worship. Please review [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]].
