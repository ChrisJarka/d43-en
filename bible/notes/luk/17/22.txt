\v 22 And he said to the disciples, "The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.
\v 23 And they will say to you, 'Look, there! Look, here!' Don't go looking, nor follow after them,
\v 24 for as the lightning appears when it flashes from one part of the sky to another part of the sky, so will the Son of Man be in his day.
