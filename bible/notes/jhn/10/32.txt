\v 32 But Jesus said to them, "You have seen me perform many miracles that my Father \add told me to do. You should realize from seeing them that I am equal with God\add*. So because of which of these miracles \f + \ft irony \f* are you wanting to \add kill me by\add* throwing stones at me?"
\v 33 The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* replied, "We are \add wanting to\add* throw stones at you not because you performed a great miracle. Instead, \add we are wanting to do it\add* because you are dishonoring God. You are just a man, but you are saying that you are God!"

\v 32 Jesus said to them, "You have seen me do many good works, things that my Father had told me to do.  For which of them are you going to stone me?"
\v 33 The Jewish opponents replied, "We are wanting to take your life, not because you did any good work, but because you, just a man, are insulting God and are making yourself God!"

\v 32 Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of those works are you stoning me?"
\v 33 The Jews answered him, "We are not stoning you for any good work, but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are making yourself God."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father"** - Jesus' works were done in his power as God the Son, in union with God the Father. Jesus' works are also the works of the Father (and the Spirit).
  * **making yourself God** - "claiming to be God"
  * **We are not stoning you for any good work, but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are making yourself God.** - Jesus' claims to be the Son of God were blasphemy to the Jews because they thought Jesus was claiming to be God--and he was! The words "Son" and "Father" must be translated literally in your language to show that Jesus claimed to be God with those words.
