===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Paul**  - "From Paul" or "I, Paul, write this letter."
  * **according to the commandment of**  - "by the command of" or "by the authority of" or "because God has commanded me to be an apostle"
  * **our … our … our**  - Paul is talking about himself, Timothy, and probably other people as well. (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive]])
  * **God our savior**  - "God who saved us."
  * **Christ Jesus our hope**  - "Christ Jesus, who is our hope" or "Christ Jesus in whom we put our confidence about the future."
  * **To Timothy**  - "This letter is for Timothy."
  * **true son **- ​"real son." Timothy is not Paul's actual son. ​Paul uses this metaphor praises the way Timothy imitates Paul's devotion to Christ as if he were Paul's own son. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor]])
  * **Grace, mercy and peace from**  - "May grace, mercy and peace be yours from," or "May you experience, kindness, mercy and peace within from."
  * **God our Father **  - "God, who is our Father."
  * **and Christ Jesus our Lord**  - "and Christ Jesus, who is our Lord."
