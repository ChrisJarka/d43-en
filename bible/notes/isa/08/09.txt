===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Listen, all you distant countries**  - This is an apostrophe, where the speaker turns his attention from the people he is speaking to and makes an exclamation to someone who is not there with them. This can be translated as "Listen, all you people in far away places." (See: Apostrophe)
  * **arm yourselves for war and be broken in pieces; arm yourselves and be broken in pieces **- This is a repetitive doublet, where the author is saying the same thing twice for emphasis. This can be translated as, "you can prepare yourselves for battle, but your armies will be defeated." (See: Doublet)
  * **Form a plan, but it will not be carried out; issue the command, but it will not be carried out ** - This is also a repetitive doublet, where the author is saying the same thing twice for emphasis. This can be translated as, "You can prepare to attack Judah, but you will not succeed."
