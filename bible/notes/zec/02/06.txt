===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Ho**  - This term is an interjection/exclamation used by prophets.  "Ho" is the pronunciation in the original Hebrew.  It could mean "ah", "alas", or "woe", but other translations use "up", "get up", "come", "you there" in this particular verse.  The UDB has a similar idea with "run" which works well with the later "flee" as there is a sense of urgency.
    * **flee**  - This term means to run from danger.
    * **land of the north**  - This refers to Babylon.
    * **scattered you**  - An alternate translation could read "spread you abroad."
    * **I have scattered you like the four winds of the skies**  - This is a simile where Yahweh says that he has scattered Israel like the wind coming from all different directions scatters leaves or anything light. See Simile.
