\c 125
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q
\v 1 They that trust in Jehovah
\q Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but remains for ever.
\q
\v 2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem,
\q So Jehovah is round about his people
\q From this time forth and for evermore.
\q
\v 3 For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous;
\q That the righteous put not forth their hands to iniquity.
\q
\v 4 Do good, O Jehovah, to those that are good,
\q And to them that are upright in their hearts.
\q
\v 5 But as for such as turn aside to their crooked ways,
\q Jehovah will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.
\q Peace be upon Israel.
