\v 15 However, I have not requested that you \add give me\add* those things that I have a right \add to receive from you\add*. Furthermore, I am writing this to you, not in order to request you to begin \add giving me financial help now\add*. I would rather die than to \add receive help from you\add*. I do not want anyone to prevent me from boasting \add about my proclaiming God's message to you without receiving financial help from you\add*.
\v 16 When I proclaim the message about Christ, I cannot boast \add about doing it\add*, because \add Christ\add* has commanded me \add to do it\add*. I would be very miserable \f + \ft Or: \add I am afraid that\add* God would punish me \f* if I did not proclaim that message.
