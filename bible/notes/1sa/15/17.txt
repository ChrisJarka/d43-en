\v 17 And Samuel said, Though you was little in your own sight, was you not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And
Jehovah anointed you king over Israel;
\v 18 and Jehovah sent you on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them
until they be consumed.
\v 19 Wherefore then did you not obey the voice of Jehovah, but did fly upon the spoil, and did that which was evil in
the sight of Jehovah?
