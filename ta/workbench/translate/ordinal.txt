===== Description ===== 
Ordinal numbers are numbers that tell either the position of something in a list or the order in which things happens. 
The first lot went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, the third to Harim, ...  the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.  (1 Chronicles 24:7-18) 
 
Most ordinal numbers in English simply have  "-th" added to the end.  \\

^Numeral ^Number ^Ordinal Number^ 
|4 |four |fourth| 
|10 |ten |tenth|
|100 |one hundred |one hundredth|
|1000 |one thousand |one thousandth|
 
Some ordinal numbers in English do not follow that pattern. \\ 
^Numeral ^Number ^Ordinal Number^  \\ 
|1 |one |first| 
|2 |two |second|
|3 |three |third|
|5 |five |fifth|
|12 |twelve |twelfth|
 
**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages do not have special numbers for showing the order of items in a list. There are different ways to deal with this. 
 
===== Examples from the Bible =====
Ordinal numbers are used in the Bible mainly to tell the position of something in a list. \\ 
  * **This was an evening and morning, the __first__ day.**  (Genesis 1:5) \\
  * **This was an evening and morning, the __second__ day.** (Genesis 1:8) \\
 
  * **The name of the __first__ river is Pishon.** (Genesis 2:11) \\ 
  * **The name of the __second__ river is Gihon.** (Genesis 2:13) 
 
  * **He gave to the church __first__ apostles, __second__, prophets, __third__ teachers, then those who do powerful deeds...** (1 Corinthians 12:28) 
 
 
 
===== Translation Strategies =====
If your language has ordinal numbers and using them would give the right meaning, consider using them. If not, here are some strategies to consider.
  - Use the word "number" along with the number. 
  - Tell the total number of items, and then use "one" with the first item and "another" or "the next" with the rest.  
  - Simply tell the number of items and list the things associated with them. 
 
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ===== 
1. Use the word "number" along with the number. \\ 
  * **The name of the __second__ river is Gihon.** (Genesis 2:13) 
    * "The name of river __number two__ is Gihon." Genesis 2:13 
 
2. Tell the total number of items, and then use "one" with the first item and "another" or "the next" with the rest.  
  * **The first lot went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,  the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, … the twenty-third to Delaiah,  and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.**  (1 Chronicles 24:7-18)
    * "There were twenty-four lots. __One lot__ went to Jehoiarib, __another__ to Jedaiah, __another__  to Harim,…  __another__ to Delaiah, __and the last__ went to Maaziah." 
 
3.   Simply tell the number of items and list the things associated with them. 
  * **The first lot went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,  the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, … the twenty-third to Delaiah,  and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.**  (1 Chronicles 24:7-18)
    * "They cast 24 lots. The lots went to Jerhoiarib, Jedaiah, Harim, Seorim, … Delaiah, and Maaziah."
