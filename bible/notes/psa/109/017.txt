<usfm>
\v 17 He liked to curse people.
\q2 So those terrible things that he requested to happen to othersâ€”cause them to happen to him!
\q1 He did not want to bless others,
\q2 so make sure that no one blesses him!
\q1
\v 18 He often cursed other people, also;
\q2 cause the terrible things that he wanted to happen to others to happen to him and enter his body as water does,
\q2 as olive oil soaks into a person's bones when it is rubbed on his skin.


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 17 He loved cursing; may it come back upon him.
\q He hated blessing; may no blessing come to him.
\q
\v 18 He clothed himself with cursing as his garment,
\q and his curse came into his inner being like water,
\q like oil into his bones.
