\v 22 "Your eyes are \add like\add* a lamp \f + \ft metaphor \f* for your body, because they enable you to see things. So if your eyes are healthy, you are able to see everything well \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if you are generous with your money and other possessions, you will be able to know much of what God wants you to know\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 23 But if your eyes are bad, you are not able to see things well. And if that continues, the time will come when you will not be able to see at all. You will be in complete darkness \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if you continue to be greedy, you will be in spiritual darkness. If all that your eyes can see and your mind can think about involves your greedily desiring material possessions, all that you do will be evil\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*."

\v 24 "No one is able to serve two \add different\add* bosses \add at the same time\add*. If \add he tried to do that\add*, he would hate one of them and love the other one, or he would be loyal to one of them and despise the other one \f + \ft doublet \f*. \add Similarly\add*, you cannot \add devote your life to\add* worshipping God and \add worshipping\add* money and material goods \add at the same time\add*."

\v 22 "Your eyes are like a lamp for your body, because they enable you to see things. So if you see things as God sees them, it will be as if your whole body were full of light.
\v 23 But if your eyes are bad, you are not able to see things well. You will be in complete darkness. How greedy you will be! 



\p
\v 24 "No one is able to serve two different masters at the same time. If he tried to do that, he would hate one of them and love the other one, or he would be loyal to one of them and despise the other one. Similarly, you cannot worship God and  money at the same time."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore, if your eye is pure, your whole body will be full of light.
\v 23 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. Therefore if the light that is in you is actually darkness,
how great is that darkness!
\v 24 No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.
