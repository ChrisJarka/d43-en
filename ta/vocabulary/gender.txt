===== Gender Notations =====

The English language makes a distinction in pronouns between male, female and neuter nouns.

"Whomever" is neither masculine nor feminine.  The same is true for 'it'; however, it is not a word English ever uses for people.

Many languages do not make a distinction between "he" and "she", instead, those languages use "it" for people.  English does not do that. This can be a tricky aspect of translation for some;  In fact, when Chinese students speak English they often mistakenly refer to men as "she" and women as "he".

Interestingly I was just watching a pastor give a sermon where he quotes a Bible passage pertaining to marriage, and claims "whomever" is a masculine pronoun. I know "whomever" can stand for men or women thus it is not masculine, it is neutral. Apparently, however, the original sentence was talking about a person being "betrothed to whomever", which implies that the "whomever" definitely refers to a man.
