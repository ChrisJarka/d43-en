  * **sons of God **- "heavenly beings" or "angels" (UDB)
  * **on the day when**  - This is not a specific day. Alternate translation, "at the time when". This gathering was routine and happened often.

  * **Satan also came among them**  - That is, "among the angels".

"To and fro" as well as "back and forth" are used together to mean everything. <font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Alternative translation: "I have been everywhere upon the earth."</font>    (See: Parallelism and Merism)
