===== Description =====

A new event happens when a new time, place, people, or main purpose of telling the idea come into a story. The new information is normally mentioned at the beginning of the new event. Most languages have definite ways and definite orders for telling the new information. 

**It happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth... to John** (Luke 3:9)- In this sentence a new event, the time, main character and place are all included.\\ 

This page will help you think through how you need to introduce this information in your language. You may need to change how and in what order new information is introduced at the beginning of a new event in order for your translation to sound natural in your language.

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Now there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish Council. This man came to Jesus at night time** (John 3:1,2)\\
The author first introduced the new person and then told about what he did and when he did. In some languages it might be more natural to tell about the time first. 

**I, John, ... was on the island called Patmos...on the Lord's day.** (Revelation 1:9)


**Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came upon the earth.** (Genesis 7:6) God had already told Noah that there would be a flood and Noah had prepared for it. This sentence introduces the part of the story that tells about Noah and his family and the animals going into the ship, the rain starting, and the rain flooding the earth. Some languages might need to make it clear that this simply introduces the event.
===== Translation Strategies =====
Consider how people who speak your language tell about events they have seen or done. How do they introduce a new story or a new part of story? What information do they give at the beginning? Is there a certain order that they put that information it? 

If the information given at the beginning of a new event is clear and natural to your readers, consider translating it as in the ULB or UDB. If not consider one of these strategies.

  - Put the information in the order that your people put it.
  - If readers would expect certain information but it is not in the Bible, consider using an indefinite word or phrase such as: another time, someone.
  - If your language introduces new people as the subject of the sentence, reorder your sentence to make the new person the subject.
  - If the new person cannot be the subject of the sentence, consider using a dummy word as the subject.
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
1. Consider how people in your language tell about happenings  they have seen or done; and follow how they have introduced new people, places, times and purposes in their stories.
  * **One night a man named Nicodemus, who was a Pharisee and a member of the Jewish Council, came to Jesus. (John 3:1,2)**\\
2. Where this information is not known, consider using an indefinite word or phrase such as: another time, someone.
  * **When Jesus came back to Capernaum __after a few days__, (Mark 2:1)** \\
3. If your language introduces new people as the subject of the sentence reorder your sentence to make the new person the subject.
  * **As he passed by, __he saw Levi__ who was sitting at the tax collecting place (Mark 2:14)** 
    * "__Levi was sitting__ at the tax collecting place when Jesus passed by." (Mark 2:14)\\
4. If the new person cannot be the subject of the sentence, consider using a dummy word as the subject.
  * **There was a man who was sent from God, whose name was 
John.** (John 1:6)
