**Steps for checking under Level Three (Authenticated):**

Level 3 checking will be done by groups or organizations that are recognized by the churches in a language community. These groups will verify that they approve of the distribution and use of the translation among the people affiliated with them. This approval is not required for distribution of the translation, but rather serves to validate it.

Level 3 checking can be achieved by following either of two tracks. For Track One, the checking will be done by at least three church networks, and for Track Two, the checking will be done by at least one church network and by a recognized Bible translation agency. Those who do Level Three checking need to be other than the people who did Level Two checking.

**Level Three, Track One (Three Church Networks):**

The first track is completed when the content has been thoroughly checked by representatives of at least three separate Church networks. The Church networks should be representative of the churches in the language community. Those checking the translation must be first-language speakers of the language, and those signing off on the check must be in leadership roles in the Church networks. A leader of a Church network who is also a first-language speaker of the language of the translation may both check the translation and sign off on its quality. Level 3 in this track is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of multiple elements of the Church internal.

**Level Three, Track Two (Trained Translation Checker + One Church Network):**

The second track is completed when the content has been thoroughly checked by an accountable Bible translation entity in the unfoldingWord network that has training and experience in checking translated biblical content, as well as by representatives of a Church network recognized by the language community. Those checking the translation for the Church network must be first-language speakers of the language and whoever signs off on the check must be in a leadership role in the Church network (as described in the first track). Level 3 in this track is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of the Church internal and the Church global, as represented by the accountable Bible translation entity.[[:en:ta:check:1|[1]]]

In either track, the checking entities must have a track record that does not contradict their assertion that they adhere to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines.

The checkers for Level Three will follow the same steps of checking as contained in sections 3 through 5 of the Level Two checking. Then they will answer the following questions on Door43:

  - Does the translation conform to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines?
  - Did the translation team show a good understanding of the source language as well as the target language and culture?
  - Does the language community affirm that the translation speaks in a clear and natural way in their language?
  - Which of the following translation styles did the translators appear to follow?
  - Word by word translation, staying very close to the form of the source translation.
  - Phrase by phrase translation, using natural language phrase structures.
  - Meaning-focused translation, aiming for a freedom of local language expression.
  - Do the community leaders feel that the style that the translators followed is appropriate for the community?
  - Do the community leaders feel that the dialect that the translators used is the best one to communicate to the wider language community? For example, have the translators used expressions, phrase connectors, and spellings that will be recognized by a broad section of the language community?
  - Does the translation handle difficult passages well?
  - Are there cultural issues in the local community that make some passages in the book difficult to translate?
  - In these difficult passages, do the community leaders feel that the translator has used language that communicates the same message that is in the source Bible?
  - Are there any doctrinal errors in the translation?
  - Did you find any areas of the translation that seem to contradict the national language translation or the important matters of faith found in your Christian community?
  - Did the translation team add extra information or ideas that were not part of the message in the source Bible?
  -

If you answered yes to any of these questions, please explain.

  - Does the translation communicate the same message as the source Bible translation?
  - If there were problems with the translation, were you able to meet with the translation team and resolve these problems? If any problems remain unresolved, please make note of them on Door43.

[[:en:ta:check:1|[1]]] Entities such as translation organizations and church denominations can be part of the unfoldingWord network, given that they agree with the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines and that they are publicly accountable in some way to constituents who are part of the Church (including donors, members, etc.). Based on the strength of the trust relationship between entities, the unfoldingWord network can grow rapidly and it becomes self-reinforcing as multiple nodes connect to each other.
