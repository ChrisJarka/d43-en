\v 14 Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews, Behold, your King!
\v 15 They therefore cried out, Away with him, away with
him, crucify him! Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but
Caesar.
\v 16 Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified.
