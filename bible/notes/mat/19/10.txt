\v 10 We disciples said to him, "If that is true, it is better for men never to marry!"
\v 11 Then he said to us, "Not every man is able to accept this teaching. Only the men whom \add God\add* enables \add to accept it are able to do so\add*.
\v 12 There are men who \add do not marry because they are not able to have sexual relations because they\add* have been sexually defective ever since they were born. There are other men \add who do not marry because they are unable to have sexual relations\add* because they have been castrated \f + \ft Or:other men have made them that way \f*.

\v 10 The disciples say to him, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.
\v 11 But he said to them, Not all men can receive this saying, but they to whom it is given.
\v 12 For there are eunuchs, that were so born from their mother’s womb: and there are eunuchs, that were made eunuchs by men:
and there are eunuchs, that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
