=== Gen:22:17 ===

"I will surely bless you and I will greatly multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and your descendants will possess the gate of their enemies."

  * **(1) as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore**  - **(3)** Topic: Abrahams descendants. Image: The stars and Sand. Similarity: Since one cannot count the huge number of stars and grains, so people will not be able to count Agraham's descendants that God will give Abraham. **(4)** This could be translated as "beyond what you can count." **(5)** (See: [[:en:ta:translate:simile]])

=== Luk:22:44 ===

"Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground."

  * **(1) his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground**  - **(3)** Topic: Jesus sweating. Image: drops of blood. Similarity: Drops of sweat that were as large as drops of blood fell from his skin onto the ground. **(5)** (See: [[:en:ta:translate:simile]])
