\v 13 Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests!
Wail, you ministers of the altar.
Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God.
For the grain offering and the drink offering are withheld from the house of your God.
\v 14 Declare a fast
Call a sacred assembly
Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land
To the house of Yahwel your God
And cry to Yahweh.
