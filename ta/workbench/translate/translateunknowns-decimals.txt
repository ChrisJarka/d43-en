====== Decimal Numbers ======

This module answers the question:  Why is there a mark between two numbers, such as 2.5? \\
In order to understand this module, it would be good to read

The Bible contains many references to numbers of measures of volume and distance and other things. In the **ULB** these numbers are presented in the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek numbering systems as used in the Bible. In the **UDB** numbers are converted to the metric system of measures because that is the system most widely used in the world today. So, converting numbers to the metric system often results in parts of numbers that must be presented as decimals or fractions of whole numbers. This page explains the decimal numbering system used in the **UDB**. 

===== Description =====

The decimal point, or decimal comma, is a mark placed to the left of a number to show that the number refers to a part of a whole number. For example .1 meter is not a whole meter but is only one tenth of a meter. And .5 meter is not five meters, but is only five tenths of a meter. 3.7 meters is three and seven tenths of a meter.\\

In some countries people use a decimal point and in other countries people use a decimal comma. So people in countries that use a decimal comma would write “3.7 meters” as “3,7 meters.”\\

In some cultures people prefer fractions, another way of showing that a number refers to a part of a whole number. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])\\

The Biblical Volume, Biblical Weight, and Biblical Distance pages in Translation Academy list the standard volumes and weights used in the ULB and their metric equivalents found in the UDB. The conversion of Biblical measurements to metric measurements will often result in numbers as decimals or fractions: 
[[en/obe/other/biblicalvolume]], [[en/obe/other/biblicalweight]], [[en/obe/other/biblicaldistance]].


==== Translation Principles  (optional) ====

===== Examples from the Bible =====


===== Translation Strategies =====
If (an) x would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it/one. If not, here [are other options / is another option] \\ 
//(Content writer, please replace x with the issue this page is about. Reword the two sentences as needed.)//

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
A numbered list of examples that match the strategies above. Each strategy should have an example - even if the first strategy is to maintain the  form or figure. Each strategy should have only one  example because of  challenges with the Door43 formatting. \\
