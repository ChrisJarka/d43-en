====== Translation Checking with Comprehension Questions ======

The translators should verify that they have used the comprehension questions that have been developed for each chapter of a book. The translators should use these questions to test whether the translation is clear and that it accurately conveys the meaning the translator was trying to translate.

**It is important** that the audience NOT have any other translation of the Bible in front of them when they are answering these comprehension questions. They need to get their understanding ONLY from the new translation they hear or read.

Q? Have you presented this portion of the translation to local speakers of the language for them to hear or read?

Q? Have you asked the audience the comprehension questions for each portion and determined if the meaning of the translation was correctly understood?

Q? Have you taken note of any spelling rules for your language that you would like to share with others, such as where a word changes its form or two words combine?  (Are these rules acceptable to the community?)

A number of [[:en:bible:notes:checking:level1:othertesting|other testing methods]] should also be used to ensure that the translation is easy to read and sounds natural to the listeners.
