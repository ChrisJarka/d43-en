\v 28 Therefore I am eager to send him so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I will not be so worried.
\v 29 Welcome Epaphroditus in the Lord with all joy and honor him as men like him deserve,
\v 30 because he almost died doing the work of Christ, as he risked his life to serve me and supply me with what I had to have from you all at Phillipi.
