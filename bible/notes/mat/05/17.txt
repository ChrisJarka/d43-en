Instead, I \add came\add* to cause to happen \add what the authors of those books predicted would happen\add*. So do not think any longer that I have come \add to earth\add* in order that I might annul \add what they wrote\add*.
\v 18 Keep this in mind: \add Every\add* point of those laws, \add including those points that seem\add* least important, and even the smallest details of the laws \f + \ft metonymy \f* will surely be in effect \f + \ft hyperbole, litotes \f* until the heavens and the earth disappear and until all \add that God told their authors to write\add* happens.

\v 17 Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil.
\v 18 For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the
law, till all things be accomplished.
