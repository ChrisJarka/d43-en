\v 8 But Rehoboam ignored the advice of the old men that they had given him, and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.
\v 9 He said to them, "What advice do you give me, so that we may answer the people who spoke to me and said, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Rehoboam ignored the advice** - "Rehoboam did not follow the advice"
  * **who had grown up with him, who stood before him** - "who were his long-time friends, and who advised him"
  * **Lighten the yoke that your father put on us** - To "lighten the yoke" is a metaphor that represents easing the burden. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:10:03|10:4]]. AT: "Do not treat us as cruelly as your father did" or "Do not force us to work as hard as your father did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
