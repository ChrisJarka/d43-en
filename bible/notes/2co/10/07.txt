\v 7 Look at what is in front of you. If any man believes internally that he is Christâ€™s, let him think again within himself, that, just as he belongs to Christ, so do we.
\v 8 For even if I boast a lot about our authority (which the Lord gave for your edification, and not for your destruction), I will not be ashamed;
