\v 6 In the fourth month on the ninth day of the month, the famine was strong in the city and there was no bread for the people of the land.
\v 7 Then the city was conquered and all her men of war fled and went out from the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls that were beside the kingâ€™s garden, but the Chaldeans surrounded the city so they went on the way to the wilderness.
\v 8 So the army of Chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook Zedekiah in the wilderness of Jericho, and all of his army scattered from against them.
