\v 8 Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Are you listening to me, my daughter? Do not go and glean in another field; do not  leave my field, but stay here and work with my young women workers.
\v 9 Keep your eyes only on the field the men are reaping and follow behind the other women. Haven't I instructed the men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, you may go to the waterpots and drink the water that the men have drawn."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **my daughter**  - Boaz was not Ruth's real father, but called her his daughter to show that he respected her, that he was pleased that she was on his property, that he was not pursuing sexual intimacy, and that he intended to make sure things went well for her.
  * **Haven't I instructed the men **- Or, "Haven't I instructed the young men." Boaz has already given his workers instruction. He is now about to tell Ruth what he has already told the men.
