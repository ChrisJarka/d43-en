So they followed the **[[:en:obe:other:israel|Israelites]]** onto the **path through the sea**, but **[[:en:obe:kt:god|God]]** caused the **[[:en:obe:other:egypt|Egyptians]]** **to panic** and caused their **[[:en:obe:other:chariot|chariots]]** to **get stuck**. They shouted, “Run away! God is fighting for the Israelites!”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **to panic** – This could be translated as, “to get fearful and confused.” 
  * **get stuck** - The chariots could no longer move.
