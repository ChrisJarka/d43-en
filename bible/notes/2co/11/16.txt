\v 16 I say again: I do not want anyone \add among you\add* to think that my \add boasting about myself\add* is like foolish \add people\add* boast. But even if anyone \add thinks that I am boasting about myself like a foolish person boasts, listen to\add* what I \add have to say anyway, just like you listen to those false apostles\add*. They really \add speak\add* foolishly! Listen to me while I also boast a little.
\v 17 About the things that I am \add going to tell you\add*, boasting confidently \add about myself, surely you know that they are not the kind of things\add* that the Lord \add Jesus\add* would say. Instead, \add I will speak\add* as a foolish \add person would speak\add*.
\v 18 Because many \add among you\add* are boasting \add about their own work\add*, as unbelievers do, I will also boast \add about myself and my work\add* \f + \ft metonymy, irony \f*.

\v 16 No one should think I am a fool. But if you must think of me as a fool, then I must boast about the ministry God gave me.
\v 17 When I speak in this boastful confidence about my calling, this is not the way the Lord speaks of me, it is me speaking as a fool.
\v 18 Many have pointed to their human achievements and standing. I have plenty of those, as well.

\v 16 I say again: Let no one think I am a fool. But if you do, receive me as a fool so I may boast a little.
\v 17 What I am saying about this boastful confidence is not condoned by the Lord, but I speak as a fool.
\v 18 Since many people boast according to human standards, I will also boast.
