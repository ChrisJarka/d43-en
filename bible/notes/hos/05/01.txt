===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is talking about Israel.

  * **You have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread over Tabor**  - A snare and a net are both objects used to catch prey. In this case, the priests and the royal household had devised ways to keep the people away from Yahweh, while enticing them into idolatry. Mizpah and Tabor were places for idol worship in the land of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The rebels stand deep in slaughter**  - Here "rebels" refers to all of those people who had turned away from Yahweh, and "deep in slaughter" could refer to killing the sacrifices to pagan idols. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
