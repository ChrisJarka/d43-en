====== Ellipsis ======

Ellipsis is where words are left out of the sentence because it is not needed to be understood. The information that is omitted has usually already been stated in a preceding sentence or phrase.  (See also: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])

===== Translation Suggestions =====

It is important to understand what words have been omitted in the source text in order to:\\ 
◾ understand the complete meaning of the text.\\ 
◾ accurately and naturally express that meaning in the receptor language.\\ 
◾ determine whether information can remain implicit or should be stated explicitly.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Luke 18:40-41** //Jesus stood still and commanded that the man be brought to him. Then when the blind man was near, Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?" He said, "Lord, that I might receive my sight."//

**that I might receive my sight** - This is an elliptical expression in response to the Lord's question. It is not a full sentence, but its meaning can be understood from the context as “I want to receive my sight” or “Do something so that I might receive my sight.” Another alternate which would be even more explicit: “Lord, would you please enable me to see?” (or Lord, I would like you to heal me so that I can see).

===== Examples from English =====

  * No one, sir. ⇒ The speaker is responding to a previous question; the information left out would be clear in context.
 
In the following sentence, "//John can play the guitar and Mary can, too"//, the action that Mary does has been omitted because that is a natural way to express this in English. If the implied information is made explicit, the sentence would be, "//John can play the guitar and Mary can **play the guitar**, too". //  Some languages may need to include this implied information in order for the meaning to be clear.
