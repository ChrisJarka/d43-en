\v 1 My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord
of glory, with respect of persons.
\v 2 For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there come in also a poor man in vile
clothing;
\v 3 and you have regard to him that wears the fine clothing, and say, Sit you here in a good place; and you say to the poor
man, Stand you there, or sit under my footstool;
\v 4 do you not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
\v 5 Hearken, my beloved brethren; did not God choose them that are poor as to the world
to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?
\v 6 But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?
\v 7 Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?
\v 8 Howbeit if you fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well:
\v 9 but if you have respect of persons, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
\v 10 For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one
point, he is become guilty of all.
\v 11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you do not commit adultery, but killest, you
are become a transgressor of the law.
\v 12 So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.
\v 13 For judgment is without mercy to him that has showed no mercy: mercy glories against judgment.

\v 14 What does it profit, my brethren, if a man say he has faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?
\v 15 If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food,
\v 16 and one of you say to them, Go in peace, be you warmed and filled; and yout you give them not the things needful to the
body; what does it profit?
\v 17 Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.
\v 18 Yea, a man will say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith apart from
your works, and I by my works will show you my faith.
\v 19 You believest that God is one; you do well: the demons also believe, and shudder.
\v 20 But will you know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?
\v 21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?
\v 22 You see that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;
\v 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness;
and he was called the friend of God.
\v 24 You see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.
\v 25 And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them
out another way?
\v 26 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.
