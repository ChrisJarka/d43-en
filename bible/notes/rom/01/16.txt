\v 16 I very confidently proclaim the good news about what Christ has done, because this good news is the powerful way in which God saves all people who trust in what Christ has done for them. Specifically, God first saves the Jews who believe the good news, and then he saves non-Jews.
\v 17 By means of this good news God reveals how he puts people right with himself. This is like what a prophet wrote long ago in the Scriptures: "Those whom God puts right with himself will live because they trust him."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I am not ashamed**  - I am confident when I speak about the gospel. (See: Litotes). In Paul's culture, shame was not simply a feeling of embarrassment, but his sense that the public is shaming him into being quiet. Alternate translation: "I am always confident when I speak about the gospel, even if many people reject it."
  * **power of God for salvation for everyone who believes **- "Through the gospel God powerfully saves those who believe in Christ."
  * **to the Jew firstâ€¦to the Greek **- These do not denote an individual Jew or Greek, but "to Jewish people" and "to Greek people".
  * **God's righteousness is revealed**  - "God reveals his righteousness." (See: Active/Passive)
  * **from faith to faith -**  "to people who trust in God and keep trusting in him."
  * the righteous will live by faith - "It is people who trust in God that God considers right with him, and they will live forever."
