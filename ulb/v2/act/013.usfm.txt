\v 1 Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon that was
called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
\v 2 And as they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto
I have called them.
\v 3 Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
\p
\v 4 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
\v 5 And when they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as
their attendant.
\v 6 And when they had gone through the whole island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose
name was Bar-Jesus;
\v 7 who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called to him Barnabas and Saul, and sought
to hear the word of God.
\v 8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from
the faith.
\v 9 But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,
\v 10 and said, O full of all guile and all villany, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not
cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
\v 11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And
immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
\v 12 Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
\p
\v 13 Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned
to Jerusalem.
\v 14 But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day,
and sat down.
\v 15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Brethren, if you
have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
\v 16 And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said,
\p Men of Israel, and you that fear God, hearken:
\v 17 The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and
with a high arm led he them forth out of it.
\v 18 And for about the time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness.
\v 19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave
them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years:
\v 20 and after these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
\v 21 And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the
space of forty years.
\v 22 And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bare witness and said, I have found
David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do all my will.
\v 23 Of this manâ€™s seed has God according to promise brought to Israel a Saviour, Jesus;
\v 24 when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
\v 25 And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, What suppose you that I am? I am not
he. But behold, there comes one after me the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.
\v 26 Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent
forth.
\v 27 For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which are
read every sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.
\v 28 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain.
\v 29 And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a
tomb.
\v 30 But God raised him from the dead:
\v 31 and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the
people.
\v 32 And we bring you good tidings of the promise made to the fathers,
\v 33 that God has fulfilled the same to our children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second
psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
\v 34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has spoken on this wise,
I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.
\v 35 Because he says also in another psalm, You will not give your Holy One to see corruption.
\v 36 For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid to his fathers, and
saw corruption:
\v 37 but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.
\v 38 Be it known to you therefore, brethren, that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins:
\v 39 and by him every one that believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of
Moses.
\v 40 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets:
\q
\v 41 Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish;
\q For I work a work in your days,
\q A work which you shall in no wise believe, if one declare it to you.
\p
\v 42 And as they went out, they implored that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.
\v 43 Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking
to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.
\p
\v 44 And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.
\v 45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by
Paul, and blasphemed.
\v 46 And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you.
Seeing you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
\v 47 For so has the Lord commanded us, saying,
\q I have set you for a light of the Gentiles,
\q That you should be for salvation to the uttermost part of the earth.
\m
\v 48 And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God: and as many as were ordained to eternal
life believed.
\v 49 And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region.
\v 50 But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution
against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.
\v 51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.
\v 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
