====== Yahweh ======

===== Facts: =====

This is God's name that he told to Moses at the burning bush. God said that this was his name forever.

  * The name "Yahweh" comes from the ancient Hebrew verb "to be" and means "he is" or "he who is" or "he who causes to be."
  * This name reveals that God is eternal and self-existent. He did not need anyone to create him or to give him life. It also means that he is always present.
  * <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>When God introduced this name to Moses, God also referred to himself as “I am.”</font>
  * Many Bible versions in major languages such as English, French, and Spanish have used an equivalent of "the LORD" to represent "Yahweh," as in the phrase, "I am the LORD your God" or "the LORD God" and in many other contexts. Translators may want to translate these phrases as, "I am Yahweh your God" and "Yahweh God."
