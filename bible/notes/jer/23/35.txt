====== Jeremiah 23:35-36 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 What you should continually ask each other is, '\add When you spoke to Yahweh\add*, what did he reply? What is he saying to us?'
\v 36 But stop saying 'I have a prophecy\f + \ft Or: message \f* from Yahweh,' because those who say that are doing it only because they want people to accept their ideas, and by doing that they distort\f + \ft Or: change \f* the messages that are from our God, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 What you should continually ask each other is, 'When you spoke to Yahweh, what did he reply? What is he saying to us?'
\v 36 But instead you are only concerned with your own ideas and with twisting the true message from the true God, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, whom we worship.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 35 You continue to say, each person to his neighbor and each man to his brother, 'What did Yahweh answer?' and 'What did Yahweh declare?'
\v 36 But you must no longer talk about the 'burden of Yahweh,' for the burden is every man's own word, and you have perverted the words of the living God, Yahweh of hosts, our God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to deliver his message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:09|23:9]] and completes in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:37|23:40]].
  * **General Information:** - In verses 33-40 there is a wordplay with the word "burden." Sometimes it means "a message" and other times it means "a heavy load to carry." This wordplay should be retained if possible. 

  * **you have perverted the words of the living God** - AT: "you have changed the words of God to say what you want them to say"
