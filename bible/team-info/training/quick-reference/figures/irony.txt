====== Irony ======

===== Description =====

Irony is using words to say the opposite of what is meant. Irony is typically used to be humorous or to place emphasis on the differences in something. In irony, sometimes a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it.

===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.
=== Luk:15:7 ===

I say to you that even so, there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.

  * **(1) ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent** -   (3) Jesus was not saying that there really are any righteous people. Rather he was talking to people who assumed that they were righteous and better than sinners. This can be translated as **(4)** “ninety nine people who think that they are righteous and do not need to repent.”  **(5)** (See: Irony)

=== Luk:13:33 ===

"In any case, it is necessary for me to continue on today, tomorrow, and the following day, since it is not acceptable to kill a prophet away from Jerusalem."

  * **(1) it is not acceptable to kill a prophet outside of Jerusalem** - **(3)** The Jewish leaders killed many of God's prophets in Jerusalem and Jesus knew that they would kill him there too. **(4)** It can be translated as "It is in Jerusalem that the Jewish leaders kill God's messengers." **(5)** (See: Irony)
