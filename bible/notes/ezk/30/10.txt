  * **So I will make an end to the multitudes of Egypt** - Alternate translation: "I will make it so that Egypt will no longer have many people."
  * **by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar** - Nebuchadnezzar  will be the one who brings this punishment about.
  * **He and his people with him! Terrors of nations brought** - Alternate translation: "I will bring Nebuchadnezzar and his people, whom the nations are afraid of." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])

  * **draw out their swords against Egypt** - "fight against Egypt"
  * **fill the land with the slain** -  This is an exaggeration to show that the Babylonians will kill very many Egyptians.
