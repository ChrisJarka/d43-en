====== Explicit and Implicit Information ======

There are two different forms of communication found in both written and spoken messages. One is called **//explicit//** and the other //**implicit**//.\\
Every message is about a situation. The speaker, or writer, has a particular audience in mind as he gives the message. This affects the form of his message and his decision on what information to include or leave out.
  * A message with all information included is **explicit**,
  * A message that leaves out information but is still understood is **implicit**.

Although implicit information is not stated in words and only implied, it is information that the hearer needs to know if he is to understand the meaning of the message. The speaker, or writer, has succeeded in communicating his message if the hearer correctly understands what was clearly stated as well as what was implied.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Translators need to be particularly sensitive when information is not stated explicitly. If something is intentionally obscure in the text, keep it obscure in the translation. The translation should always have the same meaning as the source text.

So, what if there is implied information that would lead the reader to either an unclear or incorrect understanding of the original message? Is it okay to make it more explicit? The translator always wants to make sure the reader understands the original meaning of the message. This may mean the translation may have additional information included to make the meaning clear. Some languages may need to add an object where English (or whatever source language is being used) doesn't have one.

Implied information may be made explicit for clarification purposes if:

  * Only the implied information in the original message is made explicit,
  * No new information is added
  * It is necessary in order to communicate the main point of the message,
  * No meaning, or a wrong meaning would be communicated without the added information
  * It does not change the meaning so it is no longer true or accurate
  * or it is suitable to the original situation in which the message was given.

As always, you need to ask yourself if your translation is communicating accurately what the original message was saying.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

John 8:10 & 11 states: ‘Jesus …asked her, “Woman where are they? Has no one condemned you?” “No one, sir,” she said.’ \\ Jesus’ question is **explicit**  because it is clearly stated and understood.

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>The woman's reply is</font>    **implicit**  <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>. If the woman’s reply were explicit, she would have said, “No one has condemned me, sir.” Even though the words “</font>    //…has condemned me…//<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>” are left out, Jesus is still able to understand the woman. Her answer is understood because of the context of the conversation.</font>

===== Examples from English =====

  * David asks Susan: “Where is Joe?” David’s question is explicit because it is clearly stated and easily understood by Susan.
  * Susan answers, “At work.” Susan’s response is implicit but David understands her message is in fact “Joe is at work.”
