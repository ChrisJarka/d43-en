**What is Song of Solomon about?**\\

Song of Songs is a love song written by Solomon for his Shulamite bride.

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\ 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). 

**Is the Song of Solomon a bout a man's love for his wife or something else?**\\
It is a song of love and adoration, but a few hundred years ago the Song of Songs was read as a song of love of the redeemer for his church. The Song has been interpreted as an allegory of the love of Christ for the church. The early church fathers held this view, and it was popular until the 1800s AD. It is not a view not widely accepted today. The Song has been seen as a drama of marital love. A third approach has risen, (first suggested as early as 553 AD and rejected by the Second Council of Constantinople), that the Song of Songs is a literal account of marriage and marital love. A fourth approach is to read the Song of Songs as a collection of love songs and marriage songs, using poetry and symbolism to give expression to the love the lovers have for one another. There are other suggestions, but the conclusion may be that the Song of Song is an expression of human love, the words of spoken love and adoration are instructive and there is a moral purpose. There is an expression of true love for each other, but it also reminds us, but is not limited to the picture in the New Testament of the love of Christ which sees the church as his bride and is most deeply loved (see Ephesians 5:22-23). A balanced approach may be the most helpful.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**How many characters are in Song of Solomon?**\\

One problem that has been faced by translators is the question of whether there are two characters (Solomon and the Shulamite bride) or is there a third character, the shepherd boy. If so, there would be a conflict between the love of the Shulamite for the shepherd boy and the love which Solomon has for the Shulamite. The difficulty in resolving this question (two characters or three?) is that the characters are not clearly separated or identified in the text. The three-character reading is difficult because there is no specific person named, except by inference, as the third character.
The language of love and the celebration of those who attend the wedding and the preparation is beautiful. They exchange words of love between the couple, interrupted only by the “daughters of Jerusalem” singing songs, join in with the celebration and glory of human love. The couple has troubles (as the Song recounts, see 5:2-6:2), but they affirmed their love for one another in spite of the difficulties (see 8:5-14).
