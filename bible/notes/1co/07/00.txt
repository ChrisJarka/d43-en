====== 1 Corinthians 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Paul begins to answer their questions. The first question involves marriage. The second question is on changing ones status: a slave trying to become free, a Gentile becoming a Jew or a Jew becoming a Gentile. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

 He says that husbands and wives should continue to have sex together so as not to be tempted. Believers should not divorce. Believers married to unbelievers should not leave their husband or wife but if the husband or wife wants to leave that is all right. Paul advises that because of the difficult times and the nearness to the end of the world, unmarried people are better off not marrying but if they want to marry that is all right as well.  A single person is concerned to please Christ but a married person needs to be concerned for his spouse. But everyone should put the Lord first before all other responsibilities. 

Believers should not try to change their position in society. The slave should not try to become free, the Jew should not try to stop being Jewish and the non-Jew should not try to become a Jew.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===
