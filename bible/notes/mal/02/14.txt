\v 14 You cry out, saying "Why does Yahweh not like our offerings?" The answer is that Yahweh heard what each of you men solemnly promised to your wives when you were young. But you men have not done what you promised your wives; you sent them away, the ones with whom you made that agreement.
\p
\v 15 It is certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Yahweh who joined you together. Your spirits and your bodies belong to him. So what he wants \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* from you are godly children. So make sure that each of you men remain with\f + \ft Or: loyal to \f* the woman that you married when you were young.
\p
\v 16 Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong, says, "I hate divorce!" So if you men divorce your wives, you are overwhelming them by acting cruelly toward them. So be sure that you are not disloyal\f + \ft Or: remain united \f* to your wives. That is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says.

\v 14 Yet you say, Wherefore? Because Jehovah has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have
dealt treacherously, though she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant.
\v 15 And did he not make one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? And wherefore one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore
take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
\v 16 For I hate putting away, says Jehovah, the God of Israel, and him that covers his garment with violence, says Jehovah
of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that you deal not treacherously.
