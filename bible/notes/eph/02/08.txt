\v 8 It is \add only\add* by \add God\add* acting \f + \ft personification \f* \add toward you\add* in a way that you did not deserve that you have been saved \f + \ft Or:that he has saved you \f* as a result of your trusting \add in Christ\add*. You did not save yourselves. His saving you was his gift to you.
\v 9 He did not save any of you because of anything you yourselves did. The result is that no one can be proud of what they have done \add to save themselves\add*.
\v 10 It is God who has made us what we are now. Because of our relationship with Christ Jesus, he has enabled us to receive \add spiritual\f + \ft Or: eternal \f*\add* life in order that we should conduct our lives habitually doing the good deeds that God previously planned for us to do.

\v 8 For God has saved you from his punishment by his extreme kindness because you trust Jesus. We have not saved ourselves; this is a gift from God—
\v 9 a gift that no one can earn, so no one can boast and say that he has saved himself.
\v 10 So God has created us as new people joined to Christ Jesus, so we can do good things—things that God planned long ago for us to.
