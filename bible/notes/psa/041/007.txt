<usfm>
\q
\v 7 All that hate me whisper together against me;
\q Against me do they devise my hurt.
\q
\v 8 An evil disease, say they, clings fast to him;
\q And now that he lies he shall rise up no more.
\q
\v 9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,
\q Who did eat of my bread,
\q Hath lifted up his heel against me.
</usfm>
