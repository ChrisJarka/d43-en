\v 12 Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the
prophet Jeremiah, saying,
\v 13 Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah: You have broken the bars of wood; but you have made in their stead
bars of iron.
\v 14 For thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that
they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
