===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues His declaration to Ezekiel.

  * **"set my face against them" - **  This phrase is Yahweh telling Ezekiel that Yahweh has rejected (UDB) the people. The "them" are the people from earlier in this chapter.
  * **they have committed tresspass - **  The word "committed" means "done" or "did".
  * **this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration**  - The word "declaration" is similar to a "decree" or a "statement" that will be completed in the future.
