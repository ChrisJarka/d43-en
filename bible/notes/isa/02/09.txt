===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The common man bows down and the great man bows low before them** - The phrases "common man" and "great man" used together means "all people." Alternate translation: "From the common person to the great person, everyone bows down before idols." (See: [[en:ta:translate:merism]])
  * **therefore do not forgive them** - Here Isaiah is talking to Yahweh.
  * **Enter into the rocky places** - Here Isaiah is again talking to the people of Judah.
  * **hide in the dust** - "hide in the holes in the ground"
  * **The lofty gaze of man will be brought low, and the pride of men will be brought down,** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. This could be translated with an active verb:  “He will make humble every prideful person." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]] and [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **and Yahweh alone will be exalted** - This can be translated with an active verb: "and people will only praise Yahweh."
