\v 5 I would like you all to have the ability to speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add you have not learned\add*. But I would like even more for you to have the ability to speak messages that come directly from God. If people speak messages in a language that they have not learned, if there is no one there who can explain the meaning, that situation is not as helpful to the congregation as speaking messages that come directly from God \add in the language that the congregation knows\add*.
\p
\v 6 My fellow believers, suppose that I came to you and spoke to you in a language that none of you knows \add and I did not explain the meaning of what I told you\add*. Even if I told you something that God had revealed to me, or told you some message that had come directly from him, or taught you something that you needed to know, that certainly would not help you!\f + \ft Or: how would that help you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 5 Now I would have you all speak with other languages, but I prefer that you should prophesy. And greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks in other languages, except he interprets, so that the church may be edified.
\v 6 But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with other languages, how will it profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?
