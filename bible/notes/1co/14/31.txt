\v 32 Those who speak messages that come directly from God are in control of their own spirits, \add so they can wait for their turn to speak\add*.

<usfm>
\v 31 For each of those who proclaim the word of God with application to the entire church and have the prophetic gift, should use that gift in the church. But we insist on order. They must speak one after the other, so that even the prophets may learn from the one another and that the entire church can be encouraged.
\v 32 For the spirit of the prophets are under the control of the prophets.
\v 33 For God does not create confusion, but he makes peace. 


\p This is like the practice followed in all the other churches that God set apart for himself--
