\v 13 But if you change your behavior and stop sinning, and start to obey Yahweh our God, he will change his mind, and not send to you the disasters that he said that he would send.
\v 14 As for me, I am not able to free myself from your grasp. So you can do to me whatever you want to do.
\v 15 But you need to know that if you kill me, you will be killing a man \f + \ft synecdoche \f* who is innocent\f + \ft Or: has not done anything wrong \f*. And you and everyone else in this city will be guilty, because the truth is that it was Yahweh who sent me to speak every word that you have heard me say."

\v 13 Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of Jehovah your God; and Jehovah will repent him of the
evil that he has pronounced against you.
\v 14 But as for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as is good and right in your eyes.
\v 15 Only know you for certain that, if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city,
and upon the inhabitants thereof; for of a truth Jehovah has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.
