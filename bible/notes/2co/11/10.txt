===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 The truth of Christ is in me, and I cannot lie about this: this boasting of all I have done and how I have served and kept from being a burden to you, will be told to others throughout the regions of Achaia, because they need to know what I have done and how I have served you.
\v 11 And why would I tell others how I served you and how I would not let you help me when I was in need? Is it because I do not love you? Far from it! God knows I love you.
