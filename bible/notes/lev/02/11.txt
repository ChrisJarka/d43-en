\v 11 No grain offering, which you shall offer to Jehovah, shall be made with leaven; for you shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire to Jehovah.
\v 12 As an oblation of first fruits you shall offer them to Jehovah: but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar.
