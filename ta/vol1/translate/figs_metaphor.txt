==== Description ====

A metaphor occurs when someone speaks of one thing as if it were a different thing. The speaker does this in order to effectively describe the first thing by implying that in some important way it is similar to the other.  The thing he speaks of is called the **topic**. The thing he calls it is the **image**. The way that they are similar is the **point of comparison**.

In the metaphor below, the speaker describes the woman he loves as a rose. Both are beautiful and delicate. 
  * My love is a red, red rose. 

1. Sometimes the **topic** and the **image** are both stated clearly. 

>Jesus said to them. "__I am the bread of life__. He who comes to me will not hunger, and he who believes on me will never thirst." (John 6:35 ULB)

Jesus called himself the bread of life. The topic is "I" and the image is "bread." Bread is a food that people ate all the time. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to trust in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.

2. Sometimes only the **image** is stated clearly.

>Produce __fruits__ that are worthy of repentance (Luke 3:8 ULB)

The image here is "fruits". The topic is not stated, but it is actions or behavior. Trees can produce good fruit or bad fruit, and people can produce good behavior or bad behavior. Fruits that are worthy of repentance are good behavior that is appropriate for people who have repented.


=== Purposes of Metaphor ===

  * One purpose of metaphor is to teach people about something that they do not know (the **topic**) by showing that it is like something that they already know (the **image**).
  * Another purpose  is to emphasize that something has a particular quality or to show that it has that quality in an extreme way.
  * Another purpose is to lead people to feel the same way about one thing as they would feel toward another.
  * Often metaphors are the favorite way for speakers of a language to talk about something. In this case, the speakers are usually not aware that they are using metaphors. For example, when English speakers talk about the amount of something changing, they often say that it is going up or down. ("The literacy rate is going up." "The price of bread has gone up.") Or, when English speakers say, "This road goes to the next town," they are unaware that they are speaking as if the road were in motion. Other languages require their speakers to use other expressions, for example, "Bread is eating more of our money," "This road connects us to the next town."

=== Reasons this is a translation issue  ===

  * People may not realize that a word is being used as an image in a metaphor.
  * People may not be familiar with the thing that is used as an image. 
  * If the topic is not stated, people may not know what the topic is.
  * People may not know how the topic and the image are alike.

=== Translation Principles  ===

  * Make the meaning of a metaphor as clear to the target audience as it was to the original audience.
  * Do not make the meaning of a metaphor more clear to the target audience than it was to the original audience.


==== Examples from the Bible ====

>And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the __clay__. You are our __potter__; and we all are the work of your hand. (Isaiah 64:8 ULB)

The example above has two metaphors. The topics are "we" and "you" and the images are "clay and "potter." Just as a potter takes clay and forms a jar or dish out of it, God makes us into what he wants us to be.

>Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of __the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees__." The disciples reasoned among themselves and said, "It is because we took no bread." (Matthew 16:6-7 ULB)

Jesus used a metaphor, but his disciples did not realize it. When he said "yeast," they thought he was talking about bread, but "yeast" was the image in his metaphor about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Since the disciples did not understand what Jesus meant, it would not be good to state clearly here what Jesus meant.

==== Translation Strategies ====

If people would understand the metaphor in the same way that the original readers would have understood it, go ahead and use it. If not, here are some other strategies.
  - If the target audience would think that the phrase should be understood literally, change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding words such as "like" or "as."
  - If the target audience would not know the **image**, see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] for ideas on how to translate that image.
  - If the target audience would not use that **image** for that meaning, use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. 
  - Or, if the target audience would not use that **image** for that meaning, simply state the truth plainly that the metaphor was used to communicate.
  - If the target audience would not know what the **topic** is, then state the topic clearly. (However, do not do this if the original audience did not know what the topic was.)
  - If the target audience would not know how the topic is like the image, state it clearly.
  - If the metaphor seems to be a normal way to say something in the biblical language, a translation note often points this out. In this case, express the main idea in the simplest way preferred by your language. 

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. If the target audience would think that the phrase should be understood literally, change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding "like" or "as."
  * **And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the __clay__. You are our __potter__; and we all are the work of your hand.** (Isaiah 64:8 ULB)
    *  "And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are __like__ clay. You are __like__ a potter; and we all are the work of your hand."

2. If the target audience would not know the **image**, see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] for ideas on how to translate that image.
  * **Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you __to kick a goad__.** (Acts 26:14 ULB)
    * "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against a pointed stick."

3. If the target audience would not use that **image** for that meaning, use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. 
  * **And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the __clay__. You are our __potter__; and we all are the work of your hand.** (Isaiah 64:8 ULB)
    * "And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the __wood__. You are our __carver__; and we all are the work of your hand."
    * "And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the __string__. You are the __weaver__; and we all are the work of your hand."

4. Or, if the target audience would not use that **image** for that meaning, simply state the truth that the metaphor was used to communicate.
  * **I will make you become __fishers of men__.** (Mark 1:17 [[ULB]] )
    * "I will make you become __people who gather men__."
    * "Now you gather fish. I will make you __gather people__."

5. If the target audience would not know what the **topic** is, then state the topic clearly. (However, do not do this if the original audience did not know what the topic was.)
  * **Yahweh lives; may __my rock__ be praised. May the God of my salvation be exalted.** (Psalm 18:46 ULB)
  * "Yahweh lives; __He is my rock__. May he be praised. May the God of my salvation be exalted.

6. If the target audience would not know how the topic is like the image, state it clearly.
  * **Yahweh lives; may __my rock__ be praised. May the God of my salvation be exalted.** (Psalm 18:46 ULB)
    * "Yahweh lives; may he be praised because like a huge rock, __he shields me from my enemies__. May the God of my salvation be exalted." 

  * **Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you __to kick a goad__.** (Acts 26:14 ULB)
    * "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? You __fight against me and hurt yourself__ like an ox that kicks against its owner's pointed stick." 

7. If the metaphor seems to be a normal way to say something in the biblical language, a translation note often points this out. In this case, express the main idea in the simplest way preferred by your language. 
  * **For after David had in his own generation served the desires of God, __he fell asleep__, was laid with his fathers, and experienced decay,**  (Acts 13:36 ULB)
    * "For after David had in his own generation served the desires of God, __he died__, was laid with his fathers, and experienced decay,"
