\c 85
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
\q
\v 1 Jehovah, you have been favorable to your land;
\q You have brought back the captivity of Jacob.
\q
\v 2 You have forgiven the iniquity of your people;
\q You have covered all their sin. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 3 You have taken away all your wrath;
\q You have turned yourself from the fierceness of your anger.
\q
\v 4 Turn us, O God of our salvation,
\q And cause your indignation toward us to cease.
\q
\v 5 Wilt you be angry with us for ever?
\q Wilt you draw out your anger to all generations?
\q
\v 6 Wilt you not quicken us again,
\q That your people may rejoice in thee?
\q
\v 7 Show us your lovingkindness, O Jehovah,
\q And grant us your salvation.
\q
\v 8 I will hear what God Jehovah will speak;
\q For he will speak peace to his people, and to his saints:
\q But let them not turn again to folly.
\q
\v 9 Surely his salvation is near them that fear him,
\q That glory may dwell in our land.
\q
\v 10 Mercy and truth are met together;
\q Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
\q
\v 11 Truth springeth out of the earth;
\q And righteousness has looked down from heaven.
\q
\v 12 Yea, Jehovah will give that which is good;
\q And our land shall yield its increase.
\q
\v 13 Righteousness shall go before him,
\q And shall make his footsteps a way to walk in.
