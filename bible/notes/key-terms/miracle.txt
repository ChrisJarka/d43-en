====== miracle, wonder, sign ======

===== Definition: =====

Miracles are things that could never happen unless God caused them. For example, healing a blind person is a miracle.

  * Miracles are sometimes called "wonders" because they cause people to be filled with wonder or amazement.
  * Other times they are called "signs" because they prove that God is the one performing the miracle.
  * The expression "signs and wonders" is common in the Bible and could also be translated as "proofs and miracles" or "miraculous works" or "amazing miracles."
  * A possible translation of "miracle" might be, <font 14px line-height: 15.6800003051758px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>"impossible things that God does."</font>
