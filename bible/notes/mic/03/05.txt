\p
\v 5 Thus says Jehovah concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and
whoso puts not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:
\v 6 Therefore it shall be night to you, that you shall have no vision; and it shall be dark to you, that you shall not
divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.
\v 7 And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no
answer of God.
