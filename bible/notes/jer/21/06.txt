left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall strike them with the edge of
the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
