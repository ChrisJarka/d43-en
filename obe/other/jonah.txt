====== Jonah ======


===== Definition: =====


Jonah was a Hebrew prophet in the Old Testament.

  * The book of Jonah tells the story of when God sent Jonah to preach to the people of Nineveh.
  * Jonah refused to go to Nineveh and instead got on a ship headed for a different city.
  * God caused a huge storm to overwhelm that ship. When the men sailing the ship found out that Jonah was disobeying God, they threw him into the sea and the storm stopped.
  * God provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah and he was inside that fish for three days and nights.
  * After that, Jonah went to Nineveh and preached to the people there, and they turned from their sins.
