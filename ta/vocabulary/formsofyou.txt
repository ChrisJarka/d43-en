The word ‘singular’ means ‘one of’ or ‘single’. The word ‘dual’ means ‘two’. The word ‘plural’ means ‘many of’ or ‘multiple’.


==== Languages Differ on the Use of the Forms of You ====


Some languages, like English, have only one word for ‘you’ regardless of how many people are being spoken to. English speakers can refer to one person as ‘you’ or to many people as ‘you’. Often the context will make it clear as to whether the word ‘you’ refers to one person or more than one.


Some languages have more than one word for ‘you’ depending on how many people are being spoken to. If they are speaking to one person, they use the ‘singular’ form of ‘you’. If they are speaking to more than one person, they use the ‘plural’ form of ‘you.’


Some languages even have a ‘dual’ form for speaking to two people and some even have other forms for speaking to three or four people.


    * Note that for many languages, the decision about what form of the pronoun to use will also affect the form of the verb associated with it, even in cases where the word “you” is not expressed (for example when a command is given).


The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. These languages both have a singular form of you and a plural form of you. When reading the Bible in a language that does not have distinct singular and plural forms of ‘you’, the context will often make it clear whether the word “you” is intended to refer to one person, to two people, or to more than two people.


==== Examples from the Bible - Singular ====


Here are some examples of ‘you’ in the **Singular**  form from the Bible. When these verses were first written in the Greek language, the singular form of ‘you’ was used because it was only referring to one person.


    * Luke 18:21, 22 //He said, “I have observed all these things from my youth up.” When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”// 


Note that even though English does not have singular and plural forms of ‘you’, the context indicates that this word ‘you’ here only refers to one person. The man had just told Jesus “I have observed these things” and Jesus responded with “you”, referring only to that one man.


    * Acts 12:8 //Then the angel said to him, “Put on your clothes and sandals.” And Peter did so. “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me,” the angel told him.// 


The context makes it clear that the angel is addressing one person, so the singular form of “you” would be used here in languages that make that distinction. The verbs “put on“ and “wrap,” would also need the singular form of ‘you’.


==== Examples from the Bible - Dual ====


Here are some examples from the Bible where the word ‘you’ refers to two people. Languages that have a **D****ual**  form for the word ‘you’ would use the dual form in these verses.


    * Mark 10:35-36 //And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And [Jesus] said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”// 


Jesus is asking the **two**, James and John, what they want him to do for them.


    * Mark 11:1-2 //…Jesus sent two of his disciples, saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.// 


The context makes it clear that Jesus is addressing two persons, so the dual form of “you” would be used here in languages that make that distinction. Here the verbs “go” and “untie” would need the dual form of “you”.


==== Examples from the Bible - Instructional Text ====


In instructional text the “you” is often **Plural**  since it is addressing a wide audience. Here is an example:


    * 1 Peter 1:17 //Since you call on a Father who judges each man’s work impartially, live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear.// 


However, sometimes the instruction is addressed to one person, so the singular form of “you“ would be used. The context will make that clear. This often happens in a letter. For example:


    * Titus 1:2,5; 2:1 //To Titus, my true son in our common faith…The reason I left you in Crete was that you might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you….You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine.”//
    * Also 1 Timothy 1:28 is an example of instruction that is addressed to one person. //Timothy, my son, I give you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by following them you may fight the good fight.// 


Sometimes instructional text can be either Singular or Plural, especially when a general principle is being taught.


In the following passages, when Jesus spoke to a group of people he taught general principles that apply to individual people, so the “you” or “your” could be singular. Try it both ways and choose what sounds most natural in your language. Let us look at a couple of examples.


    * Luke 11:34 //Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body also is full of darkness.// 


Some languages that distinguish between singular and plural forms of you would use the singular form because each person has his own eyes and body and does not share his eyes and bodies with others. But other languages might use the plural form of ‘you’ because Jesus was speaking to more than one person.


    * Luke 6:21 //Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.// 


This could be translated, “Blessed are each of you…” or “Blessed are all of you…” Either one would be the correct meaning.

===== Formal / Informal =====

The Formal 'You' is used when addressing someone in authority. The Informal 'You' is used when talking with a peer or someone with less authority.  Most languages that make this distinction will use the formal form for strangers or people one does not know very well and to show respect to people of higher status. 


==== Languages Differ on the Use of the Forms of You ====

Some of you will be translating from a language like English that does not use formal and informal forms of “you.” If your language has formal and informal forms, you may sometimes wonder what the relationship is between two people in the Bible. You need to know this in order to know which form to use. The people who are writing the translation notes will try to give you the information you need in order to help you make your decision.

Some of you will be translating from a language that has formal and informal forms of “you”, such as Spanish and French. Even though these languages mark formal and informal “you”, you still need to know the relationship between the people talking in order to know which form of “‘you”’ they would have used. This is because the rules in your language may not be exactly the same as the language you are translating from.  So for you too, the people who are writing the translation notes will try to give you the information you need in order to help you make your decision. 

==== Examples from the Bible - Formal ====

Here are some examples from the Bible of where languages that make this distinction would use the **formal** form of “‘you”.

  * Luke 1:3-4 //Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
//
It is thought that Theophilus was probably a high official, judging from the way Luke addresses him as “most excellent.” If so, in many languages, the formal form of “you” (here and in the surrounding verses) would be used.
