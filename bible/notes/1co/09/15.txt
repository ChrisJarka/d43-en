\v 15 However, I have not requested that you \add give me\add* those things that I have a right \add to receive from you\add*. Furthermore, I am writing this to you, not in order to request you to begin \add giving me financial help now\add*. I would rather die than to \add receive help from you\add*. I do not want anyone to prevent me from boasting \add about my proclaiming God's message to you without receiving financial help from you\add*.
\v 16 When I proclaim the message about Christ, I cannot boast \add about doing it\add*, because \add Christ\add* has commanded me \add to do it\add*. I would be very miserable \f + \ft Or: \add I am afraid that\add* God would punish me \f* if I did not proclaim that message.

\v 15 But I have used none of these things. And I do not write these things so that it may be done for me. Rather it would be better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
\v 16 For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of because I do it out of necessity. But woe is to me, if I do not I preach the gospel.
