\v 17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son,
saying,
\v 18 Is not Jehovah your God with you? and has he not given you rest on every side? for he has delivered the inhabitants of
the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and before his people.
\v 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Jehovah your God; arise therefore, and build you the sanctuary of Jehovah
God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name
of Jehovah.
