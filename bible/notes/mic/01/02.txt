===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Listen, all you peoples. ****Listen, earth, and all that is in you **-This begins Micah's prophecy. Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are used for emphasis. Micah is as if all the people of the earth were there listening to him. (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe|Apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]] )
  * **Look, Yahweh comes out of his place; he will come down and tread on the pagan shrines on the earth**- Here Micah is stating that while God main focus is Samaria and Jerusalem, he has not overlooked what is happening in the wider world.(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The mountains will melt under him; the valleys will break apart like wax before fire, like waters that are poured down a steep place.****- ** This means God's presence will destroy the mountains and valleys.** (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]] and [[** en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] **)**
