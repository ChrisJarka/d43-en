====== Jonah 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Jonah continues in narrative while bringing the book to what seems like an inconclusive end but this book is, after all, not really about Jonah. It is about God's desire to be merciful on anyone, whether Jew or pagan.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Jonah's anger ==
It is important to see the relationship a prophet of Yahweh had with his God. The prophet was to prophecy for Yahweh and those words were to come true. It did not happen often that a prophet prophesied something that didn't end up happening. So when Jonah told the city of Nineveh that it was going to be destroyed in 40 days. Jonah was certain it was going to happen but it didn't! So now Jonah is angry because his prophecy didn't come true. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical questions ==
As in other places, Jonah asks [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|rhetorical questions]] of God to show how angry he was at Him. 

== Parallel to Mount Sinai ==
In verse 2, Jonah attributes a string of characteristics to God. A Jewish reader of this book would recognize this as a formula that Moses used of God when he was meeting God on Mount Sinai as written in Exodus. So it would be important to maintain that same phraseology in this current translation, if at all possible. 




=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

When Jonah went outside the city, he got very hot and God provided some relief through the plant. God was trying to teach Jonah through an object lesson. It is important for the reader to see this clearly.
