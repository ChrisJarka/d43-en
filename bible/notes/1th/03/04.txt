\v 4 Truly, when we were with you, we told you in advance that we were about to suffer affliction, and it came to pass, just as you know.
\v 5 For this cause also, when I could no longer stand it, I sent that I might know about your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our labor would be in vain.
