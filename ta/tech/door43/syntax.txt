====== Formatting Content ======

**DokuWiki** supports some simple markup language, which tries to make the files to be as readable as possible. This page contains the possible syntax you may use when editing the pages. The syntax for the described formatting is in the box below the examples. If you want to try something, just use the [[:playground:playground|playground]] page.

===== Basic Text Formatting =====

**Headings** - every page has a heading. The title of the page determines the displayed name in page lists and directories. The number of equal signs determine the formatting. It is important for the formatting of specific headers to be the same in all pages.

<code>
====== Page Header ====== is 6 equal signs, space, title, space, 6 equal signs

===== Section Header ===== is 5 equal signs, space, title, space, 5 equal signs
</code>


DokuWiki supports **bold**, //italic//, __underlined__ and ''monospaced'' texts. Of course you can **__//''combine'' //__**all these.

You can add Bullet lists -

and Numbered lists -

  - Item 1
  - Item 2

**Paragraphs**  are created from blank lines. If you want to **force a newline**  without a paragraph, you can use two backslashes followed by a whitespace or the end of line.

This is some text with some linebreaks \\ Note that the two backslashes are only recognized at the end of a line \\or followed by \\ a whitespace \\ this happens without it.

You should use forced newlines only if really needed.

==== Pasting Content from Word, LibreOffice, or Web Browsers ====

Use the Graphical Editor (CKG Editor, the default) for formatted content in a document or web page. Look for the “Paste from Word” button on the toolbar. (It looks like a clipboard with a W on it.)

A dialog window opens, paste in the formatted content (with **bold**, //italics//, etc.) and then click “OK.” The text is pasted into the page on Door43 with the formatting.

==== That is about all you will need to know to type in your translated story. ====
