\v 18-19 Because you have disregarded what I said in my agreement with you, I will do to you just like you did to the calves that you cut in half to show that you would surely do what you solemnly promised that you would do. I will \add enable your enemies to\add* cut you into pieces, you officials of Judah and you officials of Jerusalem, and you officials in the palace, and you priests and all you common people. I will do that because you have disregarded what you solemnly promised \add about freeing your slaves\add*.

\v 17 Therefore thus says Jehovah: You have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man
to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim to you a liberty, says Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and
I will make you to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth.
\v 18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, that have not performed the words of the covenant which they
made before me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof;
\v 19 the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, that
passed between the parts of the calf;
