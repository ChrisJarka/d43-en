\q
\v 3 They will not live in Yahwehâ€™s land,
\q but Ephraim will return to Egypt,
\q and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.
\q
\v 4 They will not pour out wine offerings to Yahweh,
\q neither will they be pleasing to him.
\q Their sacrifices will be to them as the bread of mourners,
\q all who eat it will be defiled.

\q it will not come into the house of Yahweh.
