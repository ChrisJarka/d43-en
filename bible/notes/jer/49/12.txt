\v 12 For Yahweh says this, "See, those who did not deserve it must certainly drink some of the cup. Do you yourself think you will go without punishment? You will not, for you will certainly drink.
\v 13 For I have sworn by myself—this is Yahweh's declaration—that Bozrah will become a horror, a disgrace, a devastation, and an object for cursing. All of its cities will become devastations forever.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking about what will happen to Edom.

  * **See** - "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I say"
  * **must certainly drink some of the cup ... for you will certainly drink** - Here "the cup" is a metonym that represents the contents in the cup that the people must drink. The people experiencing Yahweh's punishment is spoken of as if Yahweh's punishment were liquid in a cup and the people must drink it. AT: "must certainly experience my punishment ... for you will certainly experience my punishment" or "I will certainly still punish ... for I will certainly punish you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do you yourself think you will go without punishment?** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize the people of Edom have sinned and will certainly be punished. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Certainly, you must be aware that you will personally experience my punishment for your sins." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you yourself** - The words "you" and "yourself" refer to Edom which represents the people of Edom. The word "yourself" is used to draw attention to the people of Edom. AT: "you yourselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Bozrah will become a horror, a disgrace, a devastation, and an object for cursing** - This can be reworded to remove the abstract nouns "a horror," "a disgrace," and "a devastation." AT: "People will be terrified when they see that the city of Bozrah is devastated. And they will mock the city and use its name when they curse others" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * **Bozrah** - This is the name of a city in Edom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **All of its cities** - "All of Edom's cities"
