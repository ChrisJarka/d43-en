\v 34 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country; for they would not suffer them to come down to the
valley;
\v 35 but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed,
so that they became subject to taskwork.
\v 36 And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
