====== inherit, inheritance ======

===== Definition: =====

To inherit means to receive something valuable from another person because of a special relationship with that person. Often an inheritance is something that is passed down from a parent to his children.

  * The inheritance that is received may be money, land or other kinds of property.
  * In the Old Testament, God promised to Abraham and his descendants that they would inherit the land of Canaan. He promised that this land would belong to them forever.
  * There is also a figurative or spiritual sense in which people who belong to God are said to "inherit the land" (Psalm 37). This means that they will prosper and be blessed by God in both physical and spiritual ways, such as with peace, joy and other spiritual fruits.
  * In the New Testament, God promises that those who trust in Jesus will "inherit salvation" and "inherit eternal life." This is a spiritual inheritance that lasts forever. As Peter wrote, this inheritance will always be there; it is kept safe in heaven for all those who believe.
  * Another way that this is expressed in the New Testament is in the phrase "inherit the kingdom of God." There are many warnings that those who act in a way that shows they do not believe in Jesus will not inherit his kingdom.
  * There are other figurative meanings for these terms:
      * The Bible says that wise people will "inherit glory" and righteous people will "inherit good things."
      * It also says that the Israelites would "inherit" the nations that they conquered. This was a promise that they would receive the good things that would come from living on that land.
      * To "inherit the promises" means to receive the good things that God has promised to give his people.
      * This term is also used in a negative sense to refer to foolish or disobedient people who "inherit the wind" or "inherit folly." This means they receive the consequences of their sinful actions, including punishment and worthless living.
  * In many contexts, the term "inherit" could be translated as "receive" or "possess." Other ways to translate "inheritance" could be, "promised gift" or "secure possession."
