\p
\v 1 Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.
\p
\v 2 I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.
\v 3 Yea, I beseech you also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also,
and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.
\p
\v 4 Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.
\v 5 Let your forbearance be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.
\v 6 In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to
God.
\v 7 And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
\b
\p
\v 8 Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever
things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be
any praise, think on these things.
\v 9 The things which you both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with
you.
\p
\v 10 But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me; wherein you did indeed take
thought, but you lacked opportunity.
\v 11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatever state I am, therein to be content.
\v 12 I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to
be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.
\v 13 I can do all things in him that strengthens me.
\v 14 Howbeit you did well that you had fellowship with my affliction.
\v 15 And you yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no
church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only;
\v 16 for even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.
\v 17 Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account.
\v 18 But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things
that came from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.
\v 19 And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
\v 20 Now to our God and Father be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
\b
\p
\v 21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.
\v 22 All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesarâ€™s household.
\p
\v 23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
