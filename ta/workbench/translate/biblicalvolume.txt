===== Description =====

The following terms are the most common units of volume used in the Bible to state how much a certain container could hold. The containers and measurements are given for both liquids (such as wine) and dry solids (such as grain). 

^  Type ^  Original Measure ^   Liters |
|  Dry |  omer |  2 liters |
|  Dry |  ephah |  22 liters |
|  Dry |  homer |  220 liters |
|  Dry |  kor |  220 liters |
|  Dry |  seah |  7.7 liters |
|  Liquid |  metrete |  40 liters |
|  Liquid |  bath |  22 liters |
|  Liquid |  hin |  3.7 liters |
|  Liquid |  kab |  1.23 liters |

=== Translation Principles === 

  - The people in the Bible did not use modern measures such as meters, liters, and kilograms. Using the original measures can help readers know that the Bible really was written long ago in a time when people used those measures.
  - Using modern measures can help readers understand the text more easily.
  - Whatever measure you use, it would be good, if possible, to tell about the other kind of measure in the text or a footnote.

==== Translation Strategies =====

  - Use the measurements from the ULB. These are the same kinds of measurements that the original writers used. Spell them in a way that is similar to the way they sound or are spelled in the ULB. (See: Copy or Borrow Words)
  - Use the metric measurements given in the UDB. The translators of the UDB have already figured how to represent the amounts in the metric system.
  - Use measurements that are already used in your language. In order to do this you would need to know how your measurements relate to the metric system and figure out each measurement.
  - Use the measurement from the ULB and include the measurement that your people know in the text or a note.
  - Use a measure that your people know, and include the measurements from the ULB in the text or in a note.


=== When the unit of measure is implied ===  
Sometimes the Hebrew does not specify a particular unit of volume but only uses a number. In these cases, many English versions, and the ULB and UDB, add the word "measure." For example in Haggai 2:16 it has, "twenty (measures) of grain" and "fifty (measures) of wine."

=== Translation Strategies.
  - Translate literally by using the number without giving a unit.\\
  - Use a generic word like "measure" or "quantity" or "portion." \\ 
  - Use the name of an appropriate container, such as "basket" for grain or "jar" for wine. \\ 
  - Use a unit of measure that you are already using in your translation.
