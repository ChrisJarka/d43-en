\v 8 How can I give you up, Ephraim?
\q How can I hand you over, Israel?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel?**  - Yahweh loves his people so much that he will not totally destroy them.
  * **How can I make you like Admah? **How can I make you like Zeboiim?****
 - //How can I make you like Admah? How can I make you like Zebolim? // can be made explicit : "I do not want to act toward you as I acted toward Admah or make you like Zeboiim—
  *

cities that I destroyed along with [[:en:obe:other:sodom]]."  (UDB) (see: Explicit and Implicit information)

  * **Verse 8**  - God tries to resolve his compassion for Israel and the punishment demanded by their sin; puts divine love into words that a human can undertand (see: Metaphor)
  * **I will not come in wrath **- does not mean Israel will escape punishment, but that Yahweh will not fully vent his anger (like he did on Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities of the plain)
