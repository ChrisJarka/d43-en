\v 1 Therefore since we have this ministry, even as we received mercy, we do not get discouraged.
\v 2 But we have renounced the shameful things that are hidden, not walking in craftiness or deliberately mishandling the word of God; but
by showing the truth, we recommend ourselves to everyoneâ€™s conscience in the sight of God.
