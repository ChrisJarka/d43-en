\v 26 The king became very distressed \add when he heard what she asked for\add* because he knew John was a very righteous man \f + \ft Or: because he now knew that he should not have made that promise to her \f*. But he could not refuse \add what she requested because\add* he had promised \add that he would give her anything she asked for\add*, and because his guests \add had heard him promise that\add*.
\v 27 So the king at once ordered the man who executes prisoners to go and \add cut off\add* John's head and bring it \add to the girl\add*. That man went to the prison and cut off John's head.
\v 28 He \add put it on\add* a platter, brought it back, and gave it to the girl. The girl took it to her mother.
\v 29 After John's disciples heard \add what happened\add*, they went \add to the prison\add* and took John's body and then they buried \add it in a burial cave\add*.


\p
\v 30 The \add twelve\add* apostles returned to Jesus \add from the places to which they had gone\add*. They reported to him what they had done and what they had taught \add to people\add*.
\v 31 He said to them, "Come \add with me\add* to a place where no people are living, in order that we can be alone and rest a little while!" \add He said this\add* because many people were continually coming to them and going \add away again\add*, with the result that \add Jesus and\add* his disciples did not have time to eat \add or do anything else\add*.
\v 32 So they went away by themselves in a boat to a place where no people were living.

\v 26 The king became exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths and for his dinner guests, he did not have the resolve to refuse her.
\v 27 And so the king sent a soldier of his guard and commanded to bring his head. And he went and beheaded him in the prison,
\v 28 and he brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
\v 29 And hearing this, his disciples came and took up his body and laid it in a tomb.
\p
\v 30 The apostles gather themselves together around Jesus, and they told him all that they had done and all they had taught.
\v 31 And he said unto them, "Come away by yourselves into a desert place and rest a while." For many were coming and going and they took no time apart for leisure even to eat.
\v 32 They went away in the boat to a desert place by themselves.
