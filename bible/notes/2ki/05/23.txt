\v 23 And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two
changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.
\v 24 And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and
they departed.
\v 25 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, Whence come thou, Gehazi? And he said, Your
servant went no whither.
