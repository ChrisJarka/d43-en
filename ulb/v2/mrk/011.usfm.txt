\c 11
\p
\v 1 And when they draw near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sends two of his
disciples,
\v 2 and says to them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as you enter into it, you shall
find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him.
\v 3 And if any one say to you, Why do you this? say you, The Lord has need of him; and straightway he will send him back
hither.
\v 4 And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him.
\v 5 And certain of them that stood there said to them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
\v 6 And they said to them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go.
\v 7 And they bring the colt to Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him.
\v 8 And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields.
\v 9 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed
is he that comes in the name of the Lord:
\v 10 Blessed is the kingdom that cometh, the kingdom
of our father David: Hosanna in the highest.
\p
\v 11 And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now
eventide, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
\p
\v 12 And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered.
\v 13 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it,
he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs.
\v 14 And he answered and said to it, No man eat fruit from you henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it.
\p
\v 15 And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in
the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;
\v 16 and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.
\v 17 And he taught, and said to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but
you have made it a den of robbers.
\v 18 And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the
multitude was astonished at his teaching.
\p
\v 19 And every evening he went forth out of the city.
\p
\v 20 And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.
\v 21 And Peter calling to remembrance says to him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which you cursed is withered away.
\v 22 And Jesus answering says to them, Have faith in God.
\v 23 Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be you taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not
doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he says comes to pass; he shall have it.
\v 24 Therefore I say to you, All things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you receive them, and you shall have
them.
\v 25 And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against any one; that your Father also who is in heaven may
forgive you your trespasses.
\v 26 \f + Many ancient authorities add v. 26 \fqa But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive
your trespasses.\f*
\p
\v 27 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the
scribes, and the elders;
\v 28 and they said to him, By what authority do you these things? or who gave you this authority to do these things?
\v 29 And Jesus said to them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these
things.
\v 30 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.
\v 31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?
\v 32 But should we say, From menâ€”they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.
\v 33 And they answered Jesus and say, We know not. And Jesus says to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
things.
