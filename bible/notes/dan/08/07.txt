\v 7 The goat struck the ram furiously and broke off its two horns, with the result that the ram had no power \add to defend itself\add*. So the goat knocked the ram down and trampled on it. No one could rescue the ram from the goat's power.
\v 8 The goat became very powerful. But when its power was very great, its horn was broken off. But four other large horns took its place. They each pointed in a different direction.

\v 7 And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and brake his two
horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and
there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
\v 8 And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there
came up four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven.
