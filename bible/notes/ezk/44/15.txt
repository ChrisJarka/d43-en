<usfm>
\v 15 But most of the priests who are descended from Levi and from the clan of Zadok faithfully worked in my temple when the other Israelites deserted me. So they must come near to me to work for me. They must stand in my presence to offer sacrifices of animals' fat and blood.
\v 16 They are the only ones who are permitted to enter my temple. They are the only ones who are permitted to come near my altar to serve me and do what I tell them to do.

\v 15 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went
astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me; and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the
blood, says the Lord Jehovah:
\v 16 they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my
charge.
