\v 16 But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
\v 17 Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent to you?
\v 18 I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?
