===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to deliver his message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:09|23:9]] and completes in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:37|23:40]].
  * **General Information:** - In verses 33-40 there is a wordplay with the word "burden." Sometimes it means "a message" and other times it means "a heavy load to carry." This wordplay should be retained if possible. 

  * **asks you ... you will say** - These two instances of "you" are singular and refer to Jeremiah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **What is the burden of Yahweh?** - Here "burden" means a message or prophecy from Yahweh.
  * **You are the burden ... cast you off** - These two instances of "you" are plural and refer to the false prophets and the priests. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **You are the burden** - Here "burden" means a heavy load. This is a metaphor that means they annoy Yahweh and he no longer wants to put up with them. AT: "You are a burden that I am tired of carrying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **This is the burden of Yahweh** - Here "burden" means a message or prophecy from Yahweh.
  * **and his house** - Here "house" is a metonym for the family that lives inside it. AT: "and his family" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
