\v 33 No one can accuse us before God of doing wrong, for he has chosen us to belong to him. He is the one who has put us right with himself.
\v 34 It is Christ Jesus himself who pleads with God for us. It is Christ who died for us and was also raised from the dead. It is Christ who is now at the place of honor, where he rules with God. He will certainly not condemn us!

\v 34 Who is the one who condemns? Is it Christ Jesus,  the one who died, and who even more importantly was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, and who also intercedes in our behalf?
