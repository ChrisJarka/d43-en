\v 4 If we go into the city, we will die there, because there is no food there. If we remain sitting here, we will die here. So let's go to where the army of Syria has set up their tents. If they kill us, we will die. But if they allow us to remain alive, we will not die."

\v 3 Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate, and they said one to another, "Why do we sit here until we die?
\v 4 If we say we will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. But if we still sit here, we still die. Now therefore come and let us go to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live, and if they kill us, we will only die.
