==== Description ====

Pronouns are words that people use instead of a noun to refer to someone or something. There are six different types of pronouns.\\ 

==== Personal Pronouns ====
Personal pronouns refer to people or things and show if the speaker is referring to himself, the person he is speaking to, or someone or something else. The following are kinds of information that personal pronouns may give.
 
=== Person ===
  * First Person - The speaker and possibly others  (I, we)
    * [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]]
    * [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]]
  * Second Person - The person or people that the speaker is talking to and possibly others  (you) 
    * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]
  * Third Person - Someone or something other than the speaker and those he is talking to (he, she, it, they)

=== Number ===
  * Singular - one  (I, you, he, she, it) 
  * Plural - more than one  (we, you, they)
   
=== Gender ===
  * Masculine - he
  * Feminine - she
  * Neuter - it

=== Relationship to other words in the sentence === 
  * Subject of the verb: I, you, he, she, it, we, they
  * Object of the verb or preposition: me, you, him, her, it, us, them
  * Possessor with a noun: my, your, his, her, its, our, their
  * Possessor without a noun: mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, theirs

==== Other Types of pronouns ====

**Reflexive Pronouns** refer to another noun or pronoun in the same sentence: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves  (See:  [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])  
  * **John saw __himself__ in the mirror.** - The word "himself" refers to John.

**Interrogative Pronouns** are used to make a question that needs more than just a yes or no for an answer: who, whom, whose, what, where, when, why, how
  * **__Who__ built the house?**

**Relative Pronouns** mark a relative clause: that, which, who, whom, where, when \\ 
  * **I saw the house __that__ John built.** The clause "that John built" tells which house I saw.
  * **I saw the man __who__ built the house.** The clause "who built the house" tells which man I saw.

**Demonstrative Pronouns** are used to draw attention to someone or something and to show distance from the speaker or something else: this, these, that, those. \\ 
  * **Have you seen __this__ here?**
  * **Who is __that__ over there?**

**Indefinite pronouns** are used when no particular noun is being referred to: any, anyone, someone, anything, something, some. Sometimes a personal pronoun is used: you, they, he or it.
  * **He does not want to talk to __anyone__.** 
  * **__Someone__ fixed it, but I do not know who.**
