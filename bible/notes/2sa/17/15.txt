\v 15 Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, "Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of
Israel to do 'this and that', but I have  counseled 'thus and so.' " 
\v 16 Now therefore go quickly and tell David, saying, "Do not camp tonight at the fords of the Arabah, but by all means cross over, or the king will be swallowed up along with all the people who are with him."
