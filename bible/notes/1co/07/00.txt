====== 1 Corinthians 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Paul begins to answer a series of questions. The first question involves marriage. The second question is on changing ones status: a slave trying to become free, a Gentile becoming a Jew or a Jew becoming a Gentile. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Divorce ==
Paul says that husbands and wives should continue to have sex together so as not to be tempted by others. Believers should try not divorce. Believers married to unbelievers should not leave their husband or wife but if the husband or wife wants to leave that is all right. Paul advises that because of the difficult times and the nearness to the return of Jesus, unmarried people are better off not marrying but if they want to marry that is all right as well. A single person is concerned to please Christ but a married person needs to be concerned for his spouse. Everyone should put the Lord first before all other responsibilities. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Euphemisms ==
There are many [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism|euphemisms]] used to describe sexual relations because this is often a taboo topic to speak about openly.
