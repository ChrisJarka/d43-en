===== The Equipment Setup =====

//This page answers the question:// //What kind of equipment is needed for an audio project?//

For every project, a certain amount of equipment will be required and must be setup at the recording site. This is a responsibility that should be done by the recordist.

The recordist should make all equipment selections, perform setup of the equipment, test everything to ensure it is working correctly before the project begins, and make sure the workspace is laid out for maximum effectiveness of the entire recording team.

In the Recommended Equipment section of this manual, equipment has been recommended for their simplicity, durability and suitability for sub-optimal project conditions.

In general, key considerations in setting up equipment include:

  * selecting a digital recording device
  * selecting audio equipment for capture and playback of sound for the team
  * cables for signal path routing
  * effective workspace for the team
  * sufficient provision for electrical power/recharging
