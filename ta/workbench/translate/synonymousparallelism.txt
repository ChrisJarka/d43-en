===== Description =====
 
Parallelism with the same meaning is a poetic device in which one complex idea is expressed in two or more different ways.  This is also called "synonymous parallelism." \\ 
Note: We use the term parallelism with the same meaning for long phrases or clauses that have the same meaning.  We use the term doublets for words or very short phrases that mean basically the same thing and are used together. 
 
**Yahweh __sees everything a person__ does and __watches all the paths he takes__.** (Proverbs 5:21)   \\ 
The first underlined phrase and the underlined phrase mean the same thing. There are three ideas that are the same between these to phrases. "Sees" corresponds with "watches," "everything … does" corresponds with "all the paths … takes," and "a person" corresponds with "he." 

Synonymous parallelism in poetry has several effects: 
  * It shows that something is very important by saying it more than once and in more than one way. 
  * It helps the hearer to think more deeply about the idea by saying it in different ways. 
  * It makes the language more beautiful and above the ordinary way of speaking. 
 

=== Reason this is a Translation Issue ===
In some languages people do not expect someone to say the same thing twice, even if it is said in two different ways. They expect that if there are two phrases or two sentences, they must have different meanings. So they  do not understand that the repetition of ideas serves to emphasize the idea. Rather they start looking for differences in meaning that the author did not intend.  
 
=== Translation Principles (optional) ===

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.** (Psalm 119:105) \\ 
If this were written as two sentences it would be: Your word is a lamp to my feet. Your word is a light for my path. You can see that both sentences are metaphors about God's word. The words 'lamp' and 'light' are parallel to each other because they refer to light. The words 'my feet' and 'my path' are also parallel, because they refer to where a person walks. So both sentences are talking about how God's word shows the person the way to walk. The sentences mean the same thing, but they say it with different words. 

**Praise Yahweh, all you nations; exalt him, all you peoples!** (Psalm 117:1) \\ 
Both parts of this verse are telling people everywhere to praise Yahweh. You can see the parallel words that have similar meaning: 'Praise' and 'exalt,' 'Yahweh' and 'him,' 'all you nations' and 'all you peoples.' The verse is not talking to two different groups; they are the same group. The verse is saying the same thing twice in different words. 

**For Yahweh has a lawsuit with his people, and he will contend with Israel.** (Micah 6:2) \\  
In some verses of poetry the parallel words might be more difficult to identify, such as in Micah 6:2. But even here we can see that 'Yahweh' and 'he' are parallel, and also 'his people' and 'Israel,' as well as 'has a lawsuit' and 'will contend.' The two parts of the verse are both saying that Yahweh has a serious disagreement with his people, Israel. These are not two different disagreements or two different groups of people. If people misunderstand verses with parallelism and think that they are making two different statements, then you could translate them as one statement. For example, you could translate Micah 6:2 as, “For Yahweh has a lawsuit with his people, Israel.” 
 

===== Translation Strategies =====
If your language uses parallelism and it would be appropriate consider using it. These strategies are for if it would be better not to use it.
 
  - Combine the ideas of both clauses into one. 
  - If it appears that the clauses are used together to show that what they say is really true, you could include words that emphasize the truth such as “truly” or “certainly.” 
  - If it appears that the clauses are used together to intensify an idea in them, you could use words like “very,” “completely” or “all.” 
 
=====Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
 
1. Combine the ideas of both clauses into one. 
  * **you have deceived me and told me lies.** (Judges 16:13-14) - Delilah expressed this idea twice to emphasize that she was very upset. \\ 
    * "You have deceived me with your lies."
  * **Yahweh sees everything a person does and watches all the paths he takes.** (Proverbs 5:21) - The phrase "all the paths he takes" is a metaphor for "all he does." 
    * "Yahweh pays attention to everything a person does."
2. If it appears that the clauses are used together to show that what they say is really true, you could include words that emphasize the truth such as “truly” or “certainly.” 
  * **you have deceived me and told me lies.** (Judges 16:13-14)
    * (No example because this does not seem to be its purpose) 
  * **Yahweh sees everything a person does and watches all the paths he takes.** (Proverbs 5:21)
    *  "Yahweh truly sees everything a person does."
3. If it appears that the clauses are used together to intensify an idea in them, you could use words like “very,” “completely” or “all.” 
  * **you have deceived me and told me lies.** (Judges 16:13-14)
    * "All you have done is lie to me."
  * **Yahweh sees everything a person does and watches all the paths he takes.** (Proverbs 5:21)
    * "Yahweh sees absolutely everything that a person does."
