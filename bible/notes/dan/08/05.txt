\v 5 And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the
ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
\v 6 And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his
power.
