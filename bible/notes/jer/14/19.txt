\v 19 Hast you utterly rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion? why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us?
We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!
\v 20 We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.
