===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the expanse of the sky**
  * **God created**  - This is logically connected to the previous verse and could be translated "So God created."
  * **swarm with swarms **- Another way to translate this is, "let the crawling things crawl". "Swarm" can mean "crawl," or "move," or "creep". It is the way a snake or a lizard moves on the ground.
  * **swarms of living creatures **- This is a general term for animals like reptiles and insects that crawl.
  * **bird **- This is used generally for "animals that fly" and includes all types of birds.
  * **great sea creature **- These are large animals that live in the sea, or "sea monsters".
  * **every living creatureâ€¦**- God made all living animals.
  * **after their kind**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:11|1:11,12]].
  * **every winged bird**  - Since all birds have wings, it may be more natural in some languages to say "every bird."
  * **God saw that it was good**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:09|1:10]].
