\c 21
\p
\v 1 And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
\v 2 saying to them, Go into the village that is over against you, and straightway you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with
her: loose them, and bring them to me.
\v 3 And if any one say anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them; and straightway he will send them.
\v 4 Now this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
\q
\v 5 Tell you the daughter of Zion,
\q Behold, your King comes to thee,
\q Meek, and riding upon an ass,
\q And upon a colt the foal of an ass.
\m
\v 6 And the disciples went, and did even as Jesus appointed them,
\v 7 and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their garments; and he sat thereon.
\v 8 And the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut branches from the trees, and spread
them in the way.
\v 9 And the multitudes that went before him, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed
is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
\v 10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this?
\v 11 And the multitudes said, This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.
\p
\v 12 And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the
tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;
\v 13 and he says to them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayour: but you make it a den of robbers.
\v 14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
\v 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children that were crying in the
temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were moved with indignation,
\v 16 and said to him, Hearest you what these are saying? And Jesus says to them, Yea: did you never read, Out of the
mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise?
\v 17 And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
\p
\v 18 Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he hungered.
\v 19 And seeing a fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he says to it,
Let there be no fruit from you henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.
\v 20 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away?
\v 21 And Jesus answered and said to them, Verily I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do what
is done to the fig tree, but even if you shall say to this mountain, Be you taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done.
\v 22 And all things, whatever you shall ask in prayour, believing, you shall receive.
\p
\v 23 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching,
and said, By what authority do you these things? and who gave you this authority?
\v 24 And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by
what authority I do these things.
\v 25 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?
\v 26 But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.
\v 27 And they answered Jesus, and said, We know not. He also said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
things.
\v 28 But what think ye? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work today in the vineyard.
\v 29 And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented himself, and went.
\v 30 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I
go, sir: and went not.
\v 31 Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus says to them, Verily I say to you, that the
publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
\v 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed
him: and you, when you saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, that you might believe him.
\p
\v 33 Hear another parable: There was a man that was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and
digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.
\v 34 And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits.
\v 35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
\v 36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did to them in like manner.
\v 37 But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
\v 38 But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his
inheritance.
\v 39 And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.
\v 40 When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to those husbandmen?
\v 41 They say to him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard to other husbandmen,
who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
\v 42 Jesus says to them, Did you never read in the scriptures,
\q The stone which the builders rejected,
\q The same was made the head of the corner;
\q This was from the Lord,
\q And it is marvelous in our eyes?
\m
\v 43 Therefore say I to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth
the fruits thereof.
\v 44 And he that falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces: but on whoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as
dust.
\v 45 And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.
\v 46 And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet.
