====== breathed ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible the term "breathed" is used figuratively to refer to giving life or having life.

  * The Bible teaches that God "breathed into" Adam the breath of life. It was at that point that Adam became a living soul.
  * In the time of the great flood, the Bible says that every creature that breathed air was drowned in the water.
  * Jesus breathed on the disciples and said "Receive the Spirit". This probably refers to literally breathing out air onto them.
  * Sometimes the term "breathing" or "breathing out" can refer to speaking.
  * The phrase "breathed his last" is a figurative way of saying "he died." It could also be translated as, "he took his last breath" or "he stopped breathing and died."
