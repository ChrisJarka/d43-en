\v 17 The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the decison by the word of the holy ones; so that  the those who are alive may know that the Most High rules over the kingdom of men, and gives it to whom he will, and sets over it the lowliest of men.'"
\v 18 "This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, saw. And you, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, because all the
men of wisdom of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation. But you are able because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.
