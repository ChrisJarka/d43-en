\v 3 Therefore, this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "I will cause you people to experience disasters,
\q2 and you will not be able to escape \f + \ft metonymy \f* from them.
\q1 You will no longer walk around proudly,
\q2 because when that happens, it will be a time of much trouble for you.
\q1
\v 4 At that time, \add your enemies\add* will make fun of you;
\q2 they will ridicule you by singing this sad song:
\q1 'We are completely ruined;
\q2 Yahweh is taking our land\f + \ft Or: fields \f* from us,
\q1 and he will give it to those who will capture us.'~"
\q1
\v 5 So \add when it is the time for the land to be given back to you\add* people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 there will be no one \f + \ft metonymy \f* who will be able to cast lots\f + \ft Or: throw marked stones \f* to determine which land belongs to whom.

\v 3 Therefore, Yahweh says,
\q "Look, I plan a disaster against this family,
\q from which you will not save your necks,
\q neither will you walk arrogantly,
\q for it is an evil time.
\q
\v 4 In that day they will use a parable against you,
\q and lament with a wailing lamentation,
\q and say, 'We are completely ruined,
\q he changes the territory of my people.
\q How can he remove it from me?
\q He divides our fields to traitors!'"
\q
\v 5 Therefore, you will have none who divides the territory by lot
\q in the assembly of Yahweh.
