===== Important Terms: =====

  * Jacob
  * Israel
  * [[:en:obe:kt:fruit|fruit]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **In the coming day **- "There is a time in the future" (See how you translated "that day")
  * **Jacob will take root; Israel will blossom and bud **- "Jacob" and "Israel" here refer to the descendants of Jacob. The people of Israel are being compared to a vine or vineyard that is taking root.  They will be in a strong relationship with Yahweh which will cause them to produce fruit. Alternate translation "The people of Israel will be well established in a relationship with Yahweh and prosperous in all they do"
  * **they will fill the surface of the ground with fruit **- "they will bless other nations with their good works"
