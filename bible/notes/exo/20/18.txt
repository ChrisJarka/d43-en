\v 18 All the people saw the thundering, the lightning, the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled and stood far off.
\v 19 They said to Moses, "Speak to us and we will listen, but do not let God speak to us, or we will die."
\v 20 Moses said to the people, "Do not fear, for God has come to test you, so that the fear of him may be in you, so that you do not sin."
\v 21 So the people stood far off, and Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.
