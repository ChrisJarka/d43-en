\v 8 Yahweh also said to Aaron, "I myself have appointed you to take care of all the sacred offerings that the Israelite people bring to me. I have given all these sacred offerings to you and to your sons. You and your descendants will get a share of these offerings permanently.
\v 9 The parts of the offerings that are not completely burned on the altar belong to you. Those parts of the sacred offerings, including the grain offerings, the offerings to make atonement for sins and to remove the guilt of sins, are set apart, and are to be given to you and your sons.

\v 8 And Jehovah spoke to Aaron, And I, behold, I have given you the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, as a portion for ever.
\v 9 This shall be your of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every grain offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render to
me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.
