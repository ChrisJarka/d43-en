\c 6
\p
\v 1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
\v 2 Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise),
\v 3 that it may be well with thee, and you may live long on the earth.
\v 4 And, you fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord.
\p
\v 5 Servants, be obedient to them that according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of
your heart, as to Christ;
\v 6 not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
\v 7 with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:
\v 8 knowing that whatever good thing each one doeth, the same shall he receive again from the Lord, whether
he be bond or free.
\v 9 And, you masters, do the same things to them, and forbear threatening: knowing that he who is both their Master and yours
is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.
\p
\v 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.
\v 11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
\v 12 For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the
world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly
places.
\v 13 Wherefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to
stand.
\v 14 Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
\v 15 and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
\v 16 withal taking up the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil
one.
\v 17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
\v 18 with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereto in all perseverance and
supplication for all the saints,
\v 19 and on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the
gospel,
\v 20 for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
\b
\p
\v 21 But that you also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall
make known to you all things:
\v 22 whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.
\b
\p
\v 23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 24 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ with
a love incorruptible.
