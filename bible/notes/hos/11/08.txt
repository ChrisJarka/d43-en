\v 8 How shall I give you up, Ephraim? how shall I cast you off, Israel? how shall I make you as Admah? how shall I set you as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together.
\v 9 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath.
