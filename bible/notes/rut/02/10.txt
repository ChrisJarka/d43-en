\v 10 When he said that, she knelt before him, with her face touching the ground. She exclaimed, "Why are you being so kind to me? I didn't think you would pay any attention to me since I am a foreigner!"
\v 11 Boaz replied, "People have told me about what you have done for your mother-in-law. They told me that you left your parents and your homeland, and you came here to live among people whom you did not know.
\v 12 I hope that Yahweh will repay you for what you have done. May your acts of kindness be rewarded fully by the God of Israel, whom you have come to for protection!""

\v 10 Then she  bowed down before Boaz, falling face down on the ground.  And said to him, "Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should be concerned about me, a foreinger?"
\v 11 And Boaz answered and said to her, "It has been reported to me, all that you have done since the death of your husband. You have left your father, mother, and the land of your birth to follow your mother-in-law and come to a people you do not know.
\v 12 Yahweh will honor your work, and reward you fully.   He is Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you are seeking refuge".
