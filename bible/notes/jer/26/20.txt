===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jeremiah stops telling about his own life and begins telling about what happened to another prophet.

  * **Meanwhile** - "While what I was just telling you about was happening"
  * **in the name of Yahweh** - The person's name is a metonym for his authority. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:26:16|26:16]]. AT: "with the authority of Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **prophesied against this city and this land** - The words "city" and "land" are metonyms for the people who live there. AT: "prophesied that bad things would happen to the people who lived in this city and this land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **heard his word** - "heard what he said"
