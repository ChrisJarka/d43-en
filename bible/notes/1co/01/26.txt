<usfm>
\v 26 My fellow believers, remember what \add kind of people you\add* were when God chose you. \add Not many of you\add* whom he chose are people whom \add unbelievers considered to be\add* wise. Very few of you were considered to be important. Very few of you came from families with a high social standing.
\v 27 Instead, it was \add usually\add* those whom \add unbelievers considered to be\add* foolish whom God chose. He did that in order to shame\f + \ft Or: discredit \f* those whom \add unbelievers consider\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise. It was \add usually\add* those \add whom unbelievers\add* considered \f + \ft irony \f* unimportant whom God chose, in order to shame\f + \ft Or: discredit \f* those whom unbelievers consider important.

\v 26 Brothers and sisters, look at the kind of person you were when God called you. See how unimportant you were. You were not the wisest of people. You were not important enough for people to obey you. You had no important ancestors.
\v 27 Instead, God chose the things that made no sense to unbelievers, in order to stop them from praising themselves. God chose to use things that were weak, to put to shame the things they believed were so strong.

\p
\v 26 Look at God's call on you, brothers and sisters. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many of you were powerful; not many of you were of noble birth.
\v 27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise. God chose what is weak in the world to shame what is strong.
