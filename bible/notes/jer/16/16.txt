\v 17 I am watching them carefully. I see every sin \add that they commit\add*. They will not be able to hide from me \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 18 Because of all the wicked things that they have done \f + \ft doublet \f*, I will punish them twice as much \add as I would punish other people\add*.

\v 16 Behold, I will send for many fishers, says Jehovah, and they shall fish them up; and afterward I will send for many
hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.
\v 17 For mine eyes are upon all their ways; they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from mine eyes.
\v 18 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of
their detestable things, and have filled mine inheritance with their abominations.
