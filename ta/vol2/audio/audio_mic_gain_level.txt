===== Setting the Mic Gain Level =====

//This page answers the question:// //How is the mic gain level set properly?//

Properly setting the gain level is an extremely important step that will have profound positive impacts on the recording. Improper gain level setting creates editing and production challenges that in many cases are not repairable.

Fortunately, setting a proper gain level is one of the easiest things to do and only takes a couple minutes. The proper level is always a careful balance of three variables:

  * mic preamp level
  * loudness of narrator's voice
  * distance of the narrator from the mic

==== About the Mic Preamp Level ====

Every mic is paired with a preamp, which may be in the form of a dedicated external preamp device, an audio interface, a mixing console channel preamp, a computer sound card or built into the mic. On a practical level, adjusting the gain level will be done either with an analog control knob on a device, by adjusting the sound settings in the computer control panel settings, or both. It is generally good advice to never set any preamp level to 100%, as it can add electronic noise into the recorded signal. If it seems that setting at 100% is necessary, it may be an indicator that one of the other three variables is not set right or that you are using equipment not designed for voice recording applications.

By contrast, if you find the need to set a level at 10% or “slightly on”, you are probably using a setup with multiple gain staging and at a different stage in the signal path the gain is set too high. 
Operating at either of these extreme volume settings is not a good idea, with risk of added noise or a recorded signal that is thin and does not replicate the quality produced in the live environment. Multi-gain level systems should be avoided if possible due to the added complexity, the exception being a mic such as the Zoom H2n (please read module on setting up the Zoom H2n).

Our recommendation is to operate within the range of 25%-75% on equipment level settings.

==== About the Loudness of the Narrator's Voice ====

The loudness of a narrator's voice will vary from person to person. Furthermore, a narrator's voice may vary at different times of the day and at different energy levels (the characteristic sound of a person's voice can also vary throughout the day). What is more important than targeting a specific volume is that the narrator's voice must sound natural. Asking a narrator to speak louder than they are comfortable doing will produce a noticeably unnatural feel to the recording. By contrast, asking a loud narrator to read quietly could yield a result that sounds lifeless or weak.

While making sure the voice sounds natural and comfortable is very important, people with extremely soft or extremely loud voices can present challenges to recording well. An excessively quiet voice will probably necessitate very high gain settings on the equipment, which increases ambient and electronic noise levels in the recording. An excessively loud voice can easily sound like shouting and even create additional echoes and other acoustical challenges to deal with.

The best idea is to encourage the narrator to use a steady, natural voice that is comfortable for them and can be sustained throughout recording sessions.

==== About the Distance of the Narrator From the Mic ====

The specific type of mic and the natural loudness level of the narrator's voice are variables that are unique to each recording, thus preventing our ability in this manual to specify an exact distance for placement of the mic. However, we recommend using the width or length of a hand (10 - 20 cm) as a general distance to begin with when setting the gain level.

==== The Process of Setting the Level ====

Our goal is for the signal level of the narrator's voice to register at approximately -6dB of amplitude on the level meter and/or waveform editor, depending on the measurement tools available in your software. We will need to adjust the gain sensitivity level to accomplish this.

Create a new file and begin recording. Have the narrator practice speaking at their natural volume level a hand-length away from the mic, with the mic volume set to about 50%. Observe the amplitude level of the recording, In rare cases, the volume will be consistently higher than -6dB. If so, keep decreasing the gain level setting until you have reached a proper recording volume. In many cases, the test recording volume level will be inadequate. If that is the case, follow these steps in the following order of priority.

  - Make sure the narrator is positioned comfortably and is projecting their voice to the best of their ability while still sounding natural. Sometimes beginning narrators might be reading softly for lack of confidence in a new and unfamiliar role. Other times they may not realize that they can project their voice a little louder while still sounding natural and feeling very comfortable. Be very kind and encouraging throughout the process of reaching the optimal volume output of the narrator's voice. If the test recording volume level is still low, proceed to step 2.
  - Make sure the narrator is maintaining a hand-length distance from the mic. Many beginning narrators might gauge their distance initially, but within seconds move their posture for comfort or to be able to view the text more easily. Suddenly, they are no longer a hand-length away but may be even up to a forearm length away. Make sure they are in a comfortable position and can view the text easily. Then watch to make sure the narrator is keeping the correct distance consistently. If these things are being done correctly and the test volume level is still low on the recording, proceed to step 3.
  - As explained earlier in this module, we can often turn the mic preamp gain up to about 75% without adding too much background or electronic noise. Begin increasing the mic preamp gain level up towards 75% until you have reached the target level in the test recording.
