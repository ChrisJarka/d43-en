\v 1 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
\v 2 And the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is your petition, queen Esther? and it
shall be granted thee: and what is your request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
\v 3 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my
life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:
\v 4 for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and
bondwomen, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king’s damage.
\v 5 Then spoke the king Ahasuerus and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that dared presume in his heart
to do so?
\v 6 And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
\v 7 And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went
into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was
evil determined against him by the king.
\v 8 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch
whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s
mouth, they covered Haman’s face.
\v 9 Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which
Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, stands in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him thereon.
\v 10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.
