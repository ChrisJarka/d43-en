====== Luke 1:21-23 ======


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\p 
\v 21 While Zechariah and the angel were talking in the temple, the people in the courtyard were waiting for Zechariah to come out. They wondered why he was staying in the temple for such a long time. 
\v 22 When he came out, he was not able to speak to them. Because he could not talk, he made motions with his hands to try to explain what had happened. Then they realized that he had seen a vision from God while he was in the temple. 
\p 
\v 23 When Zechariah's time to work as a priest in the temple was finished, he left Jerusalem and went to his home.
