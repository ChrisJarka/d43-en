\v 17 But in Mount Zion there will be those that escape and it will be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions.
\v 18 The house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau will be stubble, and they will burn them, and consume them. There will be no survivors to the house of Esau, for Yahweh has spoken it."

  * **it will be holy** - The word "it" refers to "mount Zion."
  * **house of Jacob will be a fire ... Joseph a flame** - Yahweh speaks of the houses of Jacob and Joseph as if they were fire because they will destroy Esau like a fire that quickly and completely burns up straw. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the house of Jacob** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to Jacob's descendants. AT: "descendants of Jacob" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
