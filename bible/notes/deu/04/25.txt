<usfm>
\v 25 When you have been in the land \add of Canaan\add* for a long time and you have children and grandchildren, do not sin by making an idol that represents anything at all, because Yahweh says that is evil, and if you do that, you will cause him to become angry with you \add and punish you\add*.
\v 26 Today I am requesting everyone who is in heaven and everyone who is on the earth \f + \ft metonymy \f* to watch what you are doing. \add If you disobey what I am telling you\add*, you will soon all die in the land that you will be crossing the Jordan \add River\add* to occupy. You will not live very long there; Yahweh will completely get rid of many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* of you.

\v 25 When you shall beget children, and childrenâ€™s children, and you shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah your God, to provoke him to anger;
\v 26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto you go over the Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyoud.
