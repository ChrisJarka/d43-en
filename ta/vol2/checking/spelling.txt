In order for the reader to be able to read and understand the translation easily, it is important that you spell the words consistently. This can be difficult if there is not a tradition of writing or spelling in the target language. It is even more difficult when several people are working on different parts of the translation, and they have different ideas about how to spell words. For that reason, it is important for the translation team to meet together before they start translating to talk about the writing system that they will use, and how they plan to spell words. 

There will be some words that are easy to spell, and other words that are difficult. Discuss the difficult words as a team. If you find that the difficulty is because the words have sounds in them that are difficult to represent, then you may need to discuss a change in the writing system that you are using. It may be that you need to modify one or more symbols to represent the difficult sound. If the difficulty is because there are different ways that the sounds can be represented and the members of the team have different ideas about how to represent the sounds, then you will need to discuss this and come to an agreement. Then it can be helpful to make a list, such as on a spreadsheet, of these difficult words. Put these words in the list in alphabetical order, spelled in the way that you have decided to spell them. Make sure that each member of the translation team has a copy of the list, so that they can consult it when translating. Add to the list as you come across more difficult words, and make sure that each team member has a current list. It usually works best if one person keeps the master list and regularly distributes it to the others. 

Some of the most difficult words to spell consistently in any language are the names of people and places in the Bible. This is because many of them are strange and unusual in most target languages. Be sure to include names on your list of difficult words.

Computers can be a great help for checking spelling. If you are using MS Word for a Gateway Language, it will probably have a dictionary already loaded and will check the spelling for you. If you are translating into an Other Language, you can use the find/replace feature to find words that are spelled wrong and replace them with the correct spelling. If you are using Sovee, it will suggest words as they were spelled the first time that they were used. You can accept that spelling, or correct it. If you correct it, Sovee will learn the new spelling and suggest that to you in the future. If you are using translationStudio, we recommend that you export your translation and import it into ParaTExt. Then run the spell checking feature in ParaTExt, and it will find all variant spellings of words. It will present these to you and then you can choose which spellings you have decided to use.
