====== Galatians 04:17-18 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Those \add who are insisting on obeying Jewish rules\add* are eagerly \add showing interest in\add* you, but \add what they are doing is\add* not good. They even want you not to associate with \add me and other true\add* believers, because they want you to eagerly show \add interest in\add* them, \add not in us\add*.
\v 18 But \add just like\add* it always feels good to have others show that they appreciate you, \add I would like you\add* always \add to appreciate me\add*, and not only when I am with you.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Those who are insisting on obeying Jewish rules are seeking to get you to follow them, but not for your good. They want to keep you away from me and other true believers, because they want you to passionately follow them, not me.
\v 18 It is good to have passion for good reasons, as I always desire you to have passion for Christ, and even for myself, but all the time and not only when I am present with you.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 They passionately seek you, but for no good. They want to separate you from me so you will follow them.
\v 18 It is good to have others passionately seek you, if it is for the right reason, but all the time and not only when I am present with you.
</usfm>
