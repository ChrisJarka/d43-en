\v 15 Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods and all the women who stood in the great assembly, and all the people who were living in the land of Egypt in Pathros answered Jeremiah and said,
\v 16 â€œThe word that you have declared to us in the name of Yahweh: We will not listen to you!
\v 17 For we will certainly do all the things that came out from our mouth, to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and devote drink offerings to her just as we, our fathers, our kings, and our princes have done in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, then we will be filled with bread and be well. We will not see calamity!
