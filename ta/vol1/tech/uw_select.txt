===== Select a Language =====

This module answers the question: How do I select a language?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: ['uW_install']

To change the language of the stories in unfoldingWord, tap the arrow in the upper left corner of the screen. At the list of languages, tap the language you would like to view.
**Note: ** To update the list of languages, tap the cloud icon in the green bar at the top of the screen.

Go back to the __[[:en:ta:tech:uw|unfoldingWord]]__ page.



Next we recommend you learn about: ['uW_install', 'uW_first', 'uW_checking', 'uW_language', 'uW_audio']
