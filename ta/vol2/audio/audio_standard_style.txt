===== Style =====

This module answers the question: //What is the style standard for unfoldingWord audio?//\\
==  ==

Style is perhaps one of the most challenging characteristics to create a standard for because we live in a world with diverse cultures. Style is also a characteristic that is gauged subjectively based on personal perceptions.

A similar challenge observed regarding style is that like many other standards addressed here, many recordists do not give much careful consideration to the topic at any point in the project. By contrast, we suggest that the topic of style is extremely important to consider carefully and handle with wisdom.

The style standards for unfoldingWord are shaped by the input of the global Church, including pastors, ministry workers and missionaries engaged in evangelism, teaching and discipleship in oral societies. The style standards below identify the best practices for creating audio content with the highest degree of current usefulness, future versatility and consistency with the predominate style preferences expressed and requested for audio content.
