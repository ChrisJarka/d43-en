===== Description =====

In all languages, most metaphors fall into broad patterns of associations between ideas. The patterns of associations found in the Bible are often unique to the Hebrew and Greek languages. It is useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems on how to translate them. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere.

After becoming familiar with these patterns, translators will see that many **similes** in the Bible are built on these same associations of ideas. 

These patterns of associating one idea with another present three challenges to anyone who wants to identify them:

(1) When looking at particular metaphors in the Bible, it is not always obvious what two ideas are associated with each other. For example, it may not be immediately obvious that the expression //It is God who puts strength on me like a belt// Ps. 18:32 (ULB) is based on the association of clothing with moral quality. (See: "Clothing represents a moral quality" in [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_manmade]])

(2) When looking at a particular expression, the translator needs to know whether or not it represents something else. This can only be done by considering the surrounding text. The surrounding text shows us for example, whether “lamp” refers concretely to a container with oil and a wick for giving light or to life. (See: "FIRE or LAMP represents life" in [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_phenom]]).

(3) Expressions that are based on these associations of ideas frequently combine together in complex ways. Moreover, they frequently combine with—and in some cases are based on—common metonymies and cultural models.  (See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part2]] and [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part3]].)
