====== prince ======

===== Definition: =====

A prince is the son of a king.

  * In the Bible, Jesus is called the Prince of Peace.
  * n Acts 2:36, Peter says God has made Jesus “both Lord and Christ.” Acts 5:31 says God made Jesus “Prince and Savior” so it appears that in the context Prince is a synonym for Lord.

In Scripture, prince can refer to Satan or an evil spiritual figure, such as the prince of Persia, a satanic being who resisted the Archangel Michael in bringing God's message to Daniel.
