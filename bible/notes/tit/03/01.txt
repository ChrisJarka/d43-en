\v 1 Titus, be sure to remind our people that, as much as possible, we should comply with the rules and laws that govern our society. We need to be obedient and ready to do good at every opportunity.
\v 2 We should not say disrespectful things about any one or argue with people. It is good to let other people have their preferences instead of pushing to get our own way, and to treat everyone with gentleness.
