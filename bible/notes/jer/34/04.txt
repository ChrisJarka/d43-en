\v 4 Surely listen to the word of Yahweh, Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says Yahweh concerning you: You will not die by the sword.
\v 5 You will die in peace and like the funerary burning of your fathers, the first kings who were before you; in that manner they will burn you and woe, lord! 
They will lament for you since I have declared this word.—this is Yahweh’s declaration.’”
