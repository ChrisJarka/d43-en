\v 5 Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets
\qWho make my people err.
\qFor those who feed them
\qThey cry, "Peace,"
\qBut for those who put nothing in their mouths,
\qThey prepare war against him.
\q
\v 6 Therefore, it will be night to you with no vision,
\qIt will be dark so you will not divine.
\qThe sun will go down on the prophets,
\qAnd the day will be dark on them.
\q
\v 7 The seers will be put to shame,
\qand the diviners confounded.
\qAll of them will cover their lips,
\qFor there is no answer from God.
