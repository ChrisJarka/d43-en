\v 15 When therefore you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy
place (let him that readeth understand),
\v 16 then let them that are in Judaea flee to the mountains:
\v 17 let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house:
\v 18 and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak.
