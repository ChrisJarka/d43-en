===== Checking Level One â€“ Internal Check =====

==== Definition of Checking Level One ====

<font 14px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Level One checking will be done primarily by the translation team, with some help from others in the language community. The translator or translation team should check their translation before they translate very many stories or chapters of the Bible, so that they can correct mistakes as early as possible in the translation process. Many of the steps in this process will need to be done several times before the translation is finished.</font>

For the purposes of the unfoldingWord project, translations of Bible texts are only published once they achieve Level Two. Other biblical content is made available at Level One. This enables the broadest reach of the content as an active project, with an open invitation (implied or direct) to help improve the translation.

==== Steps for checking under Level One (Internal): ====

These are the steps that the translation team must follow in order to achieve Checking Level One.

  - The translator (or team) makes contact with at least one element of the unfoldingWord network, notifying unfoldingWord that they intend to begin translation. One way to do that is by clicking [here].
  - Review the [[:en:statement-of-faith|Statement of Faith]] and the [[:en:translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines]].
  - The translator (or team) asserts that the Statement of Faith is an accurate reflection of their own beliefs and that they intend to translate the content in harmony with it [here].
  - The translator (or team) asserts that they intend to translate the content in accordance with the Translation Guidelines [here].
  - Draft some portions of the text. For instructions on how to make a draft translation, click [[:en:ta:check:draft|here.]]
  - Self Check. For instructions on how to do a Self Check of your draft translation, click [[:en:ta:check:selfcheck|here.]]
  - Peer Check. For instructions on how to do a Peer Check of your draft translation, click [[:en:ta:check:peercheck|here. ]]
  - Important Term Check. For instructions on how to do an Important Term Check of your draft translation, click [[:en:ta:check:importanttermcheck|here. ]]
  - Accuracy Check. For instructions on how to do an Accuracy Check of your draft translation, click [[:en:ta:check:accuracycheck|here. ]]
  - The translator (or team) affirms that they have made full use of the Translation Notes, the Important Terms, and the other exegetical and translation checking resources in the translation process, and that they have followed the steps for checking under Level One.

[[:en:ta:check:2|[2]]] [We should have a place for them to keep a master list on Door43, so the list will be easy to manage and they can avoid duplicating words and lists of words. Or do we already have a master list on Door43? Can we also have a way for them to do a search on the words in order to do a consistency check?]
