====== Proverbs 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapter 3 continues a collection of proverbs that ends in chapter nine. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Parallelism ==

Proverbs are often written without any surrounding context and in two lines of text. Each line will have a certain relationship to the other line. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Many of the proverbs are stated as promises or commands but they are intended to be advice. 

== Wisdom Call out ==

The addressee of this chapter is broader than "My Son" but is personal like the previous chapters' use of "My son". In this case, Wisdom is calling out for all to come and learn of her, in contrast to the adulteress mentioned in chapters 5-7.
