\v 12 You Kushites also will be pierced by my sword,
\v 13 and his hand will strike the north and destroy Assyria, so Nineveh will become a wasteland, dry like the desert.
\v 14 Then herds will lie down in the midst of her, every beast of the nations, and birds and owls will nest
in the tops of her pillars. There will be a chirping sound in the windows and desolation on their doorsteps, for he
has exposed the cedar-work. [[I almost want to add "of their roofs". Perhaps in the UDB?]]
