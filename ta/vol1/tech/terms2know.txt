//This answers the question:// //What terms should I know?//


==== Important Words to Know ====

//Note: These are terms that the Technology Manual will use. The translator will need to understand these terms in order to use the technology.//

**Chunk** - A chunk is a small part of the Bible text. In translationStudio, a chunk will have one or more verses. The content of the chunks is set and cannot be changed in the translationStudio program by the translator.

**End-user Bible** - This is a Bible that people have translated so that it speaks in a natural way in the target language. It is meant to be used in churches and homes. In contrast, the ULB and UDB are Bibles that are translation tools. They do not speak naturally in any language, because the ULB is a literal translation and the UDB avoids using idioms and figures of speech, which a natural translation would use. Using these translation tools, a translator can produce an end-user Bible.

**Frame** - A frame is a small part of the Open Bible Stories text. The content of the frames is set and cannot be changed in the translationStudio program by the translator.

**Gateway Language** - A Gateway Language (GL) is a language of wider communication that we have identified as being one of the languages into which we will translate all of our translation tools. The set of Gateway Languages is the smallest number of languages through which content can be delivered to every other language of the world, through translation by bilingual speakers.

**Language of Wider Communication** - A language that is spoken over a broad area and by many people. For most people, this is not their first language, but is the language that they use to speak to people outside of their language community. Some people call this a trade language. Most Bibles will be translated using a language of wider communication as the source language.

**Literal Translation** - A translation that focuses on reproducing the form of the source text in the target text, even if the meaning changes as a result.

**Meaning** - The underlying idea or concept that the text is trying to communicate to the reader or hearer. A speaker or writer can communicate the same meaning by using different forms of the language, and different people can understand different meanings from hearing or reading the same language form. In this way you can see that form and meaning are not the same thing.

**Meaning-based Translation (or Dynamic Translation)** - A translation that focuses on reproducing the meaning of the source text in the target text, even if the form changes as a result.

**Notes** - The translationNotes are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain the context in which the stories from Open Bible Stories and the Bible was written as well as inform the translator of translation options available to them.

**Original Language** - The language in which a Bible text was initially written. The Original Language of the New Testament is Greek. The Original Language of most of the Old Testament is Hebrew. However, the Original Language of some parts of Daniel and Ezra is Aramaic. The Original Language is always the most accurate language from which to translate a passage.

**Other Language** - The Other Languages (OLs) are all of the languages of the world that are not Gateway Languages. We translate our Bible translation tools into the Gateway Languages so that people can use those tools to translate the Bible into the Other Languages.

**Passage** - A section of the Bible text that is being talked about. This can be as small as one verse, but it is usually several verses that together have one topic or tell one story. 

**Questions** - The questions are about information as it appears in the story on in the ULB. Read the question and answer it according to the translated text. Click on the question for the expected answer. If the given answer and the expected answer are the same then the translation might be clear and accurate. 

**Source Language** - The language //from// which the translation is being made.

**Source Text**- The text //from// which the translation is being made.

**Target Language** - The language //into// which a translation is being made.

**Target Text**- The text being made by the translator as he or she translates the meaning from the source text.

**Text** - A text is something that a speaker or writer is communicating to a hearer or reader by means of language. The speaker or writer has a certain meaning in mind, and so he or she chooses a form of the language to express that meaning.

**Translation** - The act of expressing the meaning conveyed by the form of one language in the form of another language.

**translationAcademy** - The translationAcademy is intended to enable anyone, anywhere to equip themselves so that they will be able to make high-quality translations of Biblical content into their own language. translationAcademy is designed to be highly flexible. It can be used in a systematic, in-advance approach or it can be used for just-in-time learning (or both, as needed). It is modular in structure.

**Words** - The translationWords are important terms found in Open Bible Stories and the Bible. It is crucial that they be translated correctly. Each translationWord has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places that term is used in Open Bible Stories and the Bible to ensure that it has been translated correctly there, too.
