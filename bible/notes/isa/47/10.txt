         /q2 so you say in your heart, "I am, and there is no one else."
\v 11 /q1 Disaster will overcome you; you will not be able  to charm it away:  destruction will fall on you; you
              will not be able to ward it off:
        /q2 Calamity will strike you suddenly, before you know it.
