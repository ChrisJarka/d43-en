\v 20 \add I have written this way to you\add* because I worry that when I come \add to visit you\add*, I will see that \add some of\add* you are \add not conducting your lives the way\add* that I want you \add to\add*. If that is so, \add when I get there\add* you will see that I will have \add to act\add* in a \add very severe way toward you, and I am sure\add* that you do not want that. Specifically, I am afraid that \add some of you\add* may be quarreling, or that you are being jealous \add of each other\add*, or that you quickly \add show others that you are\add* very angry \add with them\add*, or that you are acting selfishly, or that \add some of\add* you are saying bad things about others, or that you are spreading false rumors\f + \ft Or: saying false things \f* about each other, or that you are acting proudly, or that you are \add doing things\add* in a disorderly manner.
\v 21 \add I\add* \add feel anxious\f + \ft Or: am concerned\add* \f* \add about you. I worry that\add* when I visit you again, God, the one whom I \add serve\add*, will make me feel ashamed of you \add when I see that\add* you \add still are not conducting your lives as believers should\add*. Then I will feel very sad about \add some of\add* you who were sinning previously and have not turned from your sinful behavior. \add Some of you\add* may still have impure \add thoughts. Some of you\add* may be having sexual intercourse with those to whom you are not married. \add And some of you\add* may be doing other shameful things.

\v 20 I have written this way to you because I worry that when I come to visit you, I will see that some of you are not conducting your lives the way that I want you to. If that is so, when I get there you will see that I will have to act in a very severe way toward you, and I am sure that you do not want that. Specifically, I am afraid that some of you may be quarreling, or that you are being jealous of each other, or that you quickly show others that you are very angry with them, or that you are acting selfishly, or that some of you are saying bad things about others, or that you are spreading false rumors about each other, or that you are acting proudly, or that you are doing things in a disorderly manner.
\v 21 I feel anxious about you. I worry that when I visit you again, God, the one whom I serve, will make me feel ashamed of you when I see that you still are not conducting your lives as believers should. Then I will feel very sad about some of you who were sinning previously and have not turned from your sinful behavior. Some of you may still have impure thoughts. Some of you may be having sexual intercourse with those to whom you are not married. And some of you may be doing other shameful things.

\v 20 For I am afraid that when I come, I may not find you as I wish, and that you might not find me as you wish. I am afraid that there may be arguments, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, pride, and disorder.
\v 21 I am aftaid that when I come, my God might humble me before you, and I might mourn for many of them that have sinned before now, and did not repented from the impurity and sexual immorality and indecency which they practiced.
