\v 7 But someone might answer me, "The fact that God truly keeps his promises becomes very clear because I did not do what God commanded. But the result is that people praise God because he has mercy! So God should no longer say that I should be punished on account of my having sinned, since people are praising him!
\v 8 If what you, Paul, say is true, then we might as well do evil things in order that good things like that will result! Then people will praise God!" Some people speak evil about me because they accuse me of speaking like this. God will punish people who say such things about me, and they will deserve for him to punish them!

\v 7 But if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his praise, why am I still judged as a sinner?
\v 8 And why not say—as we are falsely reported to say, and as some affirm that we say—"Let us do evil, that good may come?" The judgment on them is just.
