**Adobe Audition** – Best paid recording software for voice recording. New version (Adobe CC) can be expensive and user interface is far more complex than Ocenaudio. However, for advanced level editing Adobe Audition's included tools are impressive and can accomplish things free programs cannot begin to do. If a discontinued copy of Audition 3.0 is obtainable, users will find it to be the ideal balance of a simple, intuitive user interface and well-equipped tool set.

**Audacity** – Well known free recording/editing software, yet cumbersome and lacking in design and UI features that enable productivity and efficiency when compared to Ocenaudio and Adobe Audition. However, it possesses many editing and audio restoration tools that advanced level recordists using free software would likely For users needing to do occasional audio restoration with free software, Audacity provides tools not found in Ocenaudio's basic editing toolset, although not of comparable quality to Adobe Audition.

Notes: The conventional save commands will save your recorded audio files in their proprietary format which is not useful. Be sure to use the “Export Audio” command to save files in compatible formats such as WAV (best quality) or MP3 (low quality). If you plan to edit or save files in mp3 format you will need to download and install the mp3 encoding firmware linked below.
