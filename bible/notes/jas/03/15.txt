\v 15 Those who think like this are not wise in the way that God wants them to be. Instead, they are only thinking and acting like people who do not honor God. They think and act according to their own evil desires. They do what the demons want them to do.
\v 16 Keep in mind that people who have such attitudes do not control themselves.They take from other people and act like what they are doing is right, but it is wrong, and they do every sort of evil.
\v 17 But when people are wise in the way that God wants them to be, they commit no fault, which God considers to be very important. They also help others to live in peace, they pay attention to what other people need, they are willing to yield to the wishes of others, they have mercy on others, and they do all kinds of good things for others. How they treat others does not depend on how important they are, and they speak and act in an honest manner.
\v 18 Those who act peaceably toward others cause the others to also act peaceably, with the result that they all live together acting righteously .

\v 15 This is not a wisdom that comes down from above, but instead is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
\v 16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is confusion and every vile practice.
\v 17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, warm-hearted, full of mercy and good fruit, without favoring certain people, and sincere.
\v 18 And the fruit of righteousness is planted in peace for those who make peace.
