===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is still talking about what he plans to do to Egypt.
  * **I will make the rivers dry ground** - "I will  dry up the rivers of Egypt"
  * **sell the land into the hand of wicked men** â€“ Yahweh will give the Babylonians control over Egypt just like a person who sells something gives the one who buys it control over that thing. Alternate translation: "I will give control of the land to wicked men." (See:[[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **"I will make the land and its fullness desolate by the hand of strangers** - "I will have people from another nation destroy the land"
  * **its fullness** - "everything in the land"
  * **I, Yahweh, have declared it**  - I, Yahweh, have said that this is what will happen.
