===== Translation Notes: =====

Joel description of the coming army continues

  * **it**  - This refers to the locust army of Yahweh.
  * **A fire is consuming everything in front of it, And behind it a flame is burning.**  - This describes the complete destruction that this army brings; "the coming army is like a fire." (See:[[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **land is like the garden of Eden**  - The "land" is compared to the "garden of Eden." The "garden of Eden" is the place that Yahweh placed the first people, Adam and Eve. They had no want of anything and where told that there were things they could not do, yet they did those things and had the "garden of Eden" taken away from them and were made to live in a barren unforgiving land. Alternate translation: "The land Yahweh provided is paradise, you had want of nothing." (See:[[:en:ta:translate:simile|Simile]])
