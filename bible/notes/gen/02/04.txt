\v 4 That is how God created the heavens and the earth.

\p God, whose name is Yahweh, made the heavens and the earth.
\v 5 At first there were no plants growing, because Yahweh God had not yet caused rain to fall on the ground. Furthermore, there was no one to till the ground for planting crops.
\v 6 Instead, mist rose up from the ground, so that there was water all over the surface of the ground.

\p
\v 4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens.
\v 5 No bush of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to work the ground.
\v 6 But a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (The rest of chapter two tells about how God created people on the sixth day.)
  * **These are the generations of**  - This is a special use of the word "generations." It can be translated as "This is the account of" or "This is the story about." There are two understandings of the purpose of this sentence: 1) it refers to the events described in Gen 1:1-2:3 or 2) it introduces the events described in chapter 2. If possible, translate this so that it could be understood either way.
  * **in the day that Yahweh God created**  - The word "day" seems to refer to the time span of the creation (all six days) and not just to the sixth day. One could translate this phrase as "when the Lord God made."
  * **bush of the fieldâ€¦plant of the field**  - The "bush" generally describes a shrub growing in the wild, from which animals eat. The "plant" indicates foliage like vegetables or greens from which both animals and humans can eat.
  * **mist**  - This is like the dew or fog of the early morning. This could be translated as "underground stream."
  * **surface of the ground**  - the entire earth.
  * **bold words**  - explanation
