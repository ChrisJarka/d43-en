===== Template =====

Create notes as follows:

  - **(Required)**  Write the ULB phrase that needs explanation in bold
  - **(Optional)**  Give a simple clarifying translation
      - with synonyms
      - with minor changes in syntax
  - **(Optional)**  Explain the meaning of the phrase or word. This may involve
      - figures of speech
      - discourse issues
      - grammar issues
  - **(Optional)**  Suggest alternate ways to translate the text. These involve more complex changes than the clarifying translation. Some examples are:
      - restating a metaphor as a simile
      - restating a passive construction as active
      - restating the phrase and making implicit information explicit
  - **(Optional)**  Add TA Link
  * **(1) ULB Text**  - **(2)**  Clarifying translation. **(3)**  Text meaning. **(4)**  Alternate translation suggestion. **(5)**  (See: Translation Academy Topic)
==== Comments ====

  * All Notes require **(1)** a phrase from the ULB Text. Try to avoid single word entries. Please include the context. (Ex. for pronouns like "he", "he has promised" is better than "he")
  * The order of the appearance of these note fields is fixed.
  * The topic of the note determines which fields are optional or required.
  * If there is no **(2)** Clarifying translation and no **(3)** Text meaning, the preface **(4)**  "Alternate translation:" can be omitted.

===== Bible Examples =====

=== James 4:1 ===

Where does the quarreling and disputing among yourselves come from? Does it not arise out of your evil desires that war among your fellow believers?
