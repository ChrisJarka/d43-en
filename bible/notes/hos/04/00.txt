====== Hosea 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

As you noticed in the outline of Hosea in the Introduction, chapter 4 starts a new section of the book. This chapter is written in poetic form. The author is no longer using the metaphor of a husband wife relationship. But he is employing a new word picture using lawsuits. God is suing the people of Israel because of all the wrong they have done. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Lawsuits ==
