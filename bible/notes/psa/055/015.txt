  * **let them go down alive to sheol** - Dying suddenly is spoken of as if people were to go to sheol so fast that they do not even die first. AT: "let them suddenly go down to sheol" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for wickedness is where they live, right among them** - Their habitually doing wicked things is spoken of as if wickedness were a thing that could be with them. AT: "for they always do wicked things where they live,
