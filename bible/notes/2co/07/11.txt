\v 11 But \add think about what happened when you read my letter\add*. God caused you to be truly sorry \add for what you had done\add*. You eagerly \add wanted to do what was right\add*, and you wanted to show \add God\add* (OR\add , me\add*) that you had done the right thing. You were angry \add about what had happened\add*, and you were worried \add that God would punish you if the situation continued\add*. You also wanted me \add to visit you to encourage and help you\add*. You wanted me to know \add that you really do accept me as your apostle, and that you punished the man who had sinned as I told you to do. By doing\add* all of those things, you have shown \add me\add* that you have done what is right in this matter.
\v 12 So, even though I wrote that \add severe\add* letter to you, I did not \add write it just\add* so that \add you would punish\add* the man who had done what was wrong. Also, I \add did not write it\add* for the benefit of the person whom \add he\add* had wronged. Instead, \add I wrote it\add* so that, when you \add read the letter\add*, God would enable you to realize how much you really do respect \add my authority\add*.
\v 13 So, \add because you listened to me and did what I asked you to do\add*, I was\f + \ft Or: we\add ( exclusive )\add* were all \f* encouraged. Not only was I\f + \ft Or: were we \f* encouraged, but I was\f + \ft Or: we\add ( exclusive )\add* were \f* \add also\add* very happy to see how happy Titus was \add when he arrived here. He told me, Or: us that\add* he did not need to worry anymore, because \add he saw\add* that you all \add had a good attitude toward me\add*.

\v 11 See what strong desire this godly sorrow worked in you to prove your innocence. You showed such indignation as the charge, such alarm at the process, such great longing to have a good result, what zeal to see it through to the end and to have justice served at last! You proved you were innocent of all charges against you.
\v 12 What I wrote to you was not intended for the wrongdoer, and it was not written either for the one who suffered the wrong, but it was written for you. I wrote so show your affection for us and to show how deep it is before God.
\v 13 By all of this we are so encouraged!


\p And so we receive not only our own encouragement and comfort, we rejoice also because of the joy that Titus brought to us. He was filled with joy because all of you served him and you gave him rest and you helped him.

\v 11 See what great resolve this godly sorrow produced in you. What great resolve in you to prove you are innocent, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, and what justice was accomplished! In everything you proved yourselves to be innocent in the matter.
\v 12 Although I wrote to you, I did not write for the sake of the wrongdoer, nor for the one who suffered the wrong, but so that your earnestness for us was made known in the sight of God.
\v 13 By this we are encouraged.
