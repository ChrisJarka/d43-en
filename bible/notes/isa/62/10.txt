===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Come through, come through the gates!** - The phrase "come through" is repeated to show urgency.
  * **Build it, build the highway** - The word "build" is repeated to emphasize that God urgently wants the road prepared. "Highway" represents the way the people can return. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:bible:notes:isa:57:14|Isaiah 57:14-15]].
  * **Gather out the stones** - "Take the stones out of the road to make it smooth." Stones represent all the obstacles to quick travel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Raise up a signal flag for the nations** - Signal flag represents something to draw the attention of others. This means God is calling the people of the other nations to take notice of the land of Israel to see what God has accomplished as he said he would. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
