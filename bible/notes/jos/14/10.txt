\v 10 Now Yahweh has done for me what he promised. Forty-five years have passed since Moses said that to me during the time that we were wandering around in the desert. And just like Yahweh promised, he has kept me alive and well all during that time. Now I am eighty-five years old.
\v 11 I am as strong today as I was on the day that Moses sent me \add to explore this land\add*. I am as ready to fight now as I was then.

\v 10 And now, behold, Jehovah has kept me alive, as he spoke, these forty and five years, from the time that Jehovah spoke
this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.
\v 11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength
now, for war, and to go out and to come in.
