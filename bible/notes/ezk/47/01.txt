\v 1 And he brought me back to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house
eastward (for the forefront of the house was toward the east); and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the
house, on the south of the altar.
\v 2 Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way without to the outer gate, by the
way of the gate that looks toward the east; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
