\v 16 This is also what Yahweh said \add to the Israelite people:\add*
\q1 "Stand at the crossroads and look \add at the people who pass by\add*.
\q2 Ask them what was the good behavior \add that their ancestors had\add* long ago.
\q1 \add And when they tell you\add*, behave that way.
\q2 If you do that, you will find rest for your souls.
\q1 But you replied, 'We do not want to do that!'
\q1
\v 17 I sent \add my prophets who were like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* watchmen.
\q2 They said, 'Listen carefully when we blow the trumpets \add to warn you that your enemies are approaching\add*,'
\q2 but you said, 'No, we do not want to listen.'

\q1
\v 19 Listen, all of you!
\q2 I am going to cause disasters to happen to the Israelite people.
\q2 That is what will happen to them because they have refused to listen to what I told them.
\q2 They have refused to obey my laws.

\v 16 Thus says Jehovah, Stand you in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and
you shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk
therein.
\v 17 And I set watchmen over you, saying, Listen to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not hearken.
\v 18 Therefore hear, you nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.
\v 19 Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not
listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.
