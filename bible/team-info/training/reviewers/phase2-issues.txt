====== Phase 2 Issues ======

This is a list of general issues that we want to deal with in Phase 2.

  * **Doublets** - Do we really want to encourage translators to simply use one of them? How do we decide when that is acceptable o when too much information would be lost?

    * **Tense in prophecy** - What do we do when English versions translate it with the past tense, but it refers to things in the future?
