\c 24
\q
\v 1 Be not you envious against evil men;
\q Neither desire to be with them:
\q
\v 2 For their heart studieth oppression,
\q And their lips talk of mischief.
\q
\v 3 Through wisdom is a house builded;
\q And by understanding it is established;
\q
\v 4 And by knowledge are the chambers filled
\q With all precious and pleasant riches.
\q
\v 5 A wise man is strong;
\q Yea, a man of knowledge increases might.
\q
\v 6 For by wise guidance you shall make your war;
\q And in the multitude of counselors there is safety.
\q
\v 7 Wisdom is too high for a fool:
\q He opens not his mouth in the gate.
\q
\v 8 He that devises to do evil,
\q Men shall call him a mischief-maker.
\q
\v 9 The thought of foolishness is sin;
\q And the scoffer is an abomination to men.
\q
\v 10 If you faint in the day of adversity,
\q Your strength is small.
\q
\v 11 Deliver them that are carried away to death,
\q And those that are ready to be slain see that you hold back.
\q
\v 12 If you sayest, Behold, we knew not this;
\q Doth not he that weighs the hearts consider it?
\q And he that keeps your soul, does not he know it?
\q And shall not he render to every man according to his work?
\q
\v 13 My son, eat you honey, for it is good;
\q And the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:
\q
\v 14 So shall you know wisdom to be to your soul;
\q If you have found it, then shall there be a reward,
\q And your hope shall not be cut off.
\q
\v 15 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous;
\q Destroy not his resting-place:
\q
\v 16 For a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again;
\q But the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
\q
\v 17 Rejoice not when your enemy falleth,
\q And let not your heart be glad when he is overthrown;
\q
\v 18 Lest Jehovah see it, and it displease him,
\q And he turn away his wrath from him.
\q
\v 19 Fret not yourself because of evil-doers;
\q Neither be you envious at the wicked:
\q
\v 20 For there shall be no reward to the evil man;
\q The lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
\q
\v 21 My son, fear you Jehovah and the king;
\q And company not with them that are given to change:
\q
\v 22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly;
\q And the destruction from them both, who knows it?
\b
\p
\v 23 These also are sayings of the wise.
\b
\q To have respect of persons in judgment is not good.
\q
\v 24 He that says to the wicked, You are righteous,
\q Peoples shall curse him, nations shall abhor him;
\q
\v 25 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight,
\q And a good blessing shall come upon them.
\q
\v 26 He kisseth the lips
\q Who gives a right answer.
\q
\v 27 Prepare your work without,
\q And make it ready for you in the field;
\q And afterwards build your house.
\q
\v 28 Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause;
\q And deceive not with your lips.
\q
\v 29 Say not, I will do so to him as he has done to me;
\q I will render to the man according to his work.
\q
\v 30 I went by the field of the sluggard,
\q And by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
\q
\v 31 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns,
\q The face thereof was covered with nettles,
\q And the stone wall thereof was broken down.
\q
\v 32 Then I beheld, and considered well;
\q I saw, and received instruction:
\q
\v 33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
\q A little folding of the hands to sleep;
\q
\v 34 So shall your poverty come as a robber,
\q And your lack as an armed man.
