\v 4 And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought
them to him into the house of Jehovah; and he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Jehovah, and
showed them the king’s son.
\v 5 And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that you shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, shall
be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;
\v 6 And a third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall you keep the watch of
the house, and be a barrier.
