<usfm>
\v 7 Nevertheless, some people do not understand \add that idols are not really alive\add*. In the past, some among you who are believers now were accustomed to believing that idols \add were really alive\add*. As a result, when they eat such meat \add now\add*, they still think that it was sacrificed to an idol \add that is alive\add*. They are not sure \add that God allows believers to eat meat that has been offered to idols\add*. So, \add when they eat such meat\add*, they think that they have sinned.
\v 8 But God will not think more highly about us \add if we eat certain\add* foods, or if we do not eat \add certain foods\add*. That is, we are not more acceptable to God if we do not eat certain foods, nor are we more acceptable to him if we eat those foods.

\v 7 Howbeit not everyone has that knowledge. But some, being accustomed to idol worship until now, eat food as if it was a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
\v 8 But food will not commend us to God. Neither, if we do not eat it, are we the worse. Nor, if we do eat it, are we the better.
