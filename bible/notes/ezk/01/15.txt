\v 15 Then I looked at the living creatures; and I saw one wheel on the ground beside each of living creatures with its four faces.
\v 16 This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: Each wheel was like beryl, and the four had the same likeness; their appearance and structure was like a wheel intersecting another wheel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Ezekiel continues to tell about his vision.

  * **This was the appearance and structure of the wheels** - "This is what the wheels looked like and how they were made"
  * **like beryl** - Beryl is a kind of clear, valuable stone, often of yellow or golden color. "clear and yellow like a beryl stone" or "clear and yellow like a precious stone"
  * **the four had the same likeness** - Here the abstract noun "likeness" refers to what the four wheels looked like. The word can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "all four of the wheels looked the same" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **their appearance and structure was like a wheel intersecting another wheel** - The abstract nouns "appearance" and "structure" can be translated as verbs. AT: "they appeared to be made with one wheel going through another wheel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
