\c 15
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Jehovah, who shall sojourn in your tabernacle?
\q Who shall dwell in your holy hill?
\q
\v 2 He that walks uprightly, and works righteousness,
\q And speaks truth in his heart;
\q
\v 3 He that slandereth not with his tongue,
\q Nor does evil to his friend,
\q Nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor;
\q
\v 4 In whose eyes a reprobate is despised,
\q But who honoreth them that fear Jehovah;
\q He that swears to his own hurt, and changes not;
\q
\v 5 He that puts not out his money to interest,
\q Nor takes reward against the innocent.
\q He that does these things shall never be moved.
