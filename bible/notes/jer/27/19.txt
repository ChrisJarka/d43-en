===== Translation Notes: =====

Jeremiah continues to speak the words of Yahweh.

  * **bold words**  - The “pillars”  were probably the two bronze columns  on each side of the porch of the Temple . The “sea,” was a molton bronze basin. The ten “bases” for the ten lavers, with their engraved work of cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, are described in [[http://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/7-27.htm|1Kings 7:27-37]].
