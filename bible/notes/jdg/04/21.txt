\v 21 Sisera was very exhausted, so he soon was asleep. While he was sleeping, Jael crept quietly to him, holding a hammer and a tent peg. She pounded the peg into his skull, and all the way through his head into the ground, and he died.
\p
\v 22 When Barak came to Jael's tent to look for Sisera, she went out to greet him. She said, "Come in, and I will show you the man you are searching for!" So he followed her into the tent, and he saw Sisera lying there, dead, with the tent peg through his head.

\v 21 Then Jael Heberâ€™s wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into
his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.
\v 22 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show you the man
whom you seekest. And he came to her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.
