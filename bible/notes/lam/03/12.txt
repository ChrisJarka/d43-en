\q
\v 12 He has bent his bow and marked me as a target for an arrow.
Yes, interesting; even more literally, "He has trod on his bow [to bend it], and he has made me stand as a target for his arrow."--but maybe we don't need to go there.]
\q
\v 13 He has sent the arrows of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.
[Again, interestingly, "He has brought into my kidneys the sons of his quiver."]
\q
\v 14 I have become a laughingstock to all my people, the subject of their song day by day.
[Changed "mockery" to "subject of their [mocking] song"--i.e., taunt song, a genre well known in those days but not among us today.]
\q
\v 15 He has filled me with bitterness and forced me to drink wormwood.
