You blind guides, you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!

If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters–yes, and his own life also–he cannot be my disciple.

  * **(1) does not hate his own father**  - **(3)**  This is an exaggeration to show how important it is to love Jesus much more than anyone else. **(4)**  If it would be misunderstood, it can be translated as "does not love me much more than he loves his own father" **(5)**  (See: Hyperbole).
=== Judges 20:16 ===

Among all these people there were seven hundred chosen left-handed men; each of them could sling stones at something no wider than a hair and not miss.

  * **(1) could sling stones at something no wider than a hair and not miss**  - **(3)**  This exaggeration is used to show how amazingly accurately these men could aim and throw a stone a something. **(4)**  AT: "could sling stones at very small targets and not miss" **(5)**  (See: Hyperbole)
