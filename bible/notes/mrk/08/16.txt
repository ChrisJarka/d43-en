===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It is because we have no bread** - In this statement, it may be helpful to explain what "it" refers to. AT: "He must have said that because we have no bread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **no bread** - The disciples had only one loaf of bread, which was not much different than having no bread at all. AT: "very little bread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Why are you reasoning about not having bread?** - Here Jesus is mildly rebuking his disciples because they should have understood what he had been talking about. This can be written as a statement. AT: "You should not be thinking that I am talking about actual bread!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Do you not yet perceive?...Have your hearts become so dull?** - Jesus continues mildly rebuking his disciples. These questions can be written as statements. AT: "You should perceive and you understand what I say by now! Your hearts have become so dull!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
