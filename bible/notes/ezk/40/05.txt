\p
\v 5 There was a wall surrounding the temple complex.  and there was a measuring stick in the man’s hand, six cubits in length—each "long" cubit equaling a cubit and a handwidth. The man measured the width of the building—one stick—and the height—one stick.
\v 6 Then he went to the temple gate that faced east and up its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate—one stick in depth.
\v7 The guards' niches were each one stick long and one stick wide; there were five cubits between any two of the niches, and the threshold of the temple gate by the temple portico was one stick deep.
