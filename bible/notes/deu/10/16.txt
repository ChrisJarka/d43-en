===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **circumcise the foreskin of your heart**  - In this instance, Moses makes a parallel between circumcising the flesh of their bodies with circumcising the flesh of their hearts. He uses a physical image to convey a spiritual image. (See: Metaphor) Refers figuratively to the “cutting away” or removal of sin from a person.
  * **God of gods and Lord of lords** - If this phrase would make people think that there really are more than one god, then it might be necessary to translate it differently. AT: “the supreme God” or “the only true God." Moses is reminding the people of Israel that Yahweh is above any false god or angel that the other nations may worship and above any kings or princes of the earth.
  * ** favors no one  ** - "who shows no partiality"
  * ** takes no bribes  ** - After Moses reminds how powerful and big Yahweh is, he uses this figure of speech to exemplify that possessions, treasures or money cannot "dishonestly buy" Yahweh's favor. (See: Metaphor)
