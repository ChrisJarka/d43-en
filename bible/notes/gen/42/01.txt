===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **bold words**  - explanation
    * **Why do you look at one another?"**  - Jacob sees his sons' inaction and, by skipping over details, is trying to shame or scold them into action. If translating Jacob's words directly gives that meaning, use it. If your language needs more detail, you may select from the following: "Why are you all sitting around? Must I spell it out?" Or, "Isn't it obvious what needs doing? Lets go! Do I need to tell you everything?" Or, you may simply see that Jacob's explanation to them in the next verse works for your language.
