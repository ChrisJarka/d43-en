\q
\v 13 Surely acknowledge your iniquity, for you have transgressed against Yahweh your God;
\q And you have shared your ways with the strangers under every leafy tree!
\q For you have not listened to my voice!—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q
\v 14 Return, apostate children!—this is Yawheh’s declaration—for I have married you!
\q And I will take you, one from the city, and two from a family, and bring you to Zion!
\v 15 And I will give you shepherds after my heart, and they will shepherd you with knowledge and insight.
