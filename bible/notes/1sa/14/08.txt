\v 8 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will disclose ourselves to them.
\v 9 If they say thus to us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.
\v 10 But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up; for Jehovah has delivered them into our hand: and this shall
be the sign to us.
