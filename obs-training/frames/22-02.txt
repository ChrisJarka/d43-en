**The [[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:angel|angel]]** said to **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:zechariah-nt|Zechariah]]**, “Your wife will have a son. You will name him **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:john-baptist|John]]**. He will be **filled with the [[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:holy-spirit|Holy Spirit]]**, and will **prepare the people for the [[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]**!” Zechariah responded, “My wife and I are too old to have children! How will I know this will happen?”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The angel** - This refers to the angel that came to Zechariah in **[[:en:obs-training:frames:22-01|[22-01]]]**.
  * **filled with the Holy Spirit** - That is, "controlled by the Holy Spirit" or, "given wisdom and power by the Holy Spirit."
  * **How will I know this will happen?** - Another way to translate this would be, “How can I be sure that this will truly happen?”
