====== Adding translationAcademy Links ======

Before adding a tA link to a page, check here to see if it already exists in [[:en:ta:ta-topics]]

=== If the topic is on the translationAcademy Topics Page: ===
  * Add the link to the page using the correct link syntax.
  * If the topic exists, add the link to the page using the correct link syntax.
    * Right click on the link and choose open in a new window.
    * Click-and-Drag to select the letters on the tab of the topicâ€™s window.

  * Return to the Translation Notes editor window.
  * Replace the talink topic with the link syntax.


=== If the topic is **not** on the translationAcademy Topics Page: ===
  * Type in "(See talink TOPIC)" at the end of the Translation Note.
  * Add a tag syntax on the Bible chunk page above the Discussion syntax:

<code>
{{tag>talink}}
</code>

  * If there is already a tag listed, leave a space and add to it like this:

<code>
{{tag>ktlink talink}}
</code>

  * The tA team will see the list of chunks that need tA page/video/module here: [[:en:ta:ta-needed]]
  * Once they have created the page, they will delete the tag.
