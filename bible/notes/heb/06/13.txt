\v 14 He said \add to Abraham\add*, "I will certainly bless you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add*, and I will certainly increase \add the number of\add* your \add descendants\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*."

\v 13 For when God made his promise to Abraham, since he could not swear by anyone greater, he swore by himself,
\v 14 saying, "Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you."
\v 15 And thus, having patiently endured, Abraham obtained the promise.
