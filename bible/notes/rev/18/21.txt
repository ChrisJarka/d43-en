\v 21 A strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "In this way
will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence and will not be found any more.
\v 22 The voice of harpers, musicians, flute players, and trumpeters will not be heard any more in you. No craftsman of every craft, will not be found any more at all in you. The sound of a mill will not be heard any more in you.
