====== 1 Corinthians 01:22-23 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 The Jews want \add people to prove, by performing\add* miracles, \add that their message is true\add*. The non-Jews want to hear only messages consisting of talk that they consider to be very wise.
\v 23 As for us, we proclaim \add the message about what\add* Christ \add accomplished for us when\add* he was nailed \f + \ft Or:\add when they\add* nailed him \f* to the cross. That message offends Jews \add because they do not think that the Messiah will die, and\add* non-Jews think it is \f + \ft irony \f* a foolish message.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 The Jews wanted public displays of miraculous power before they would follow anyone. The Greeks are looking for wisdom through different ways of thinking and believing.
\v 23 But we proclaim a message about Christ, who died on a cross. For the Jews it is something that they do not want to believe. To the Greeks it is seems too foolish.

\v 22 For the Jews ask for miraculous signs and the Greeks seek wisdom.
