===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 22 Obey the word, do not only hear it, deceiving your own selves. \v 23 For if anyone hears the word and does not do it, he is like a man examining his natural face in a mirror. \v 24 He examines his face, and goes away and soon forgets what he looked like. \v 25 But the person who looks carefully into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and continues obeying it, not just being a hearer who forgets, this man will be blessed as he does it. </usfm>
