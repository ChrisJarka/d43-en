\v 12 Therefore the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
\v 13 Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of
the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
\v 14 At the end of seven youars you shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that has been sold to thee, and has
served you six years, you shall let him go free from you: but your fathers listened not to me, neither inclined their
ear.
