===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \q1 \v 9 It is better to be satisfied with what the eyes see \q2 than to desire what a wandering appetite craves, \q1 which is also vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind. \q1 \v 10 Whatever has existed has already been given its name, and what mankind is like has already been known. So it has become useless to dispute with the one who is the mighty judge of all. </usfm>
