\c 8
\p
\v 1 And when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
\v 2 And behold, there came to him a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if you wilt, you can make me clean.
\v 3 And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be you made clean. And straightway his leprosy was
cleansed.
\v 4 And Jesus says to him, See you tell no man; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses
commanded, for a testimony to them.
\p
\v 5 And when he was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,
\v 6 and saying, Lord, my servant lies in the house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
\v 7 And he says to him, I will come and heal him.
\v 8 And the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof; but only say the word,
and my servant shall be healed.
\v 9 For I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to
another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
\v 10 And when Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say to you, I have not found so great
faith, no, not in Israel.
\v 11 And I say to you, that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:
\v 12 but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of
teeth.
\v 13 And Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way; as you have believed,
so be it done to thee. And the servant was healed in that hour.
\p
\v 14 And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick of a fever.
\v 15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and ministered to him.
\v 16 And when even was come, they brought to him many possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with a word, and
healed all that were sick:
\v 17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare
our diseases.
\p
\v 18 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart to the other side.
\v 19 And there came a scribe, and said to him, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you goest.
\v 20 And Jesus says to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven
have nests; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.
\v 21 And another of the disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
\v 22 But Jesus says to him, Follow me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead.
\p
\v 23 And when he was entered into a boat, his disciples followed him.
\v 24 And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.
\v 25 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Save, Lord; we perish.
\v 26 And he says to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and
there was a great calm.
\v 27 And the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?
\p
\v 28 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming
forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by that way.
\v 29 And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, you Son of God? are you come hither to torment us
before the time?
\v 30 Now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding.
\v 31 And the demons implored him, saying, If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.
\v 32 And he said to them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine: and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep
into the sea, and perished in the waters.
\v 33 And they that fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to them that were
possessed with demons.
\v 34 And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they implored
him that he would depart from their borders.
