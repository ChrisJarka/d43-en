\v 15 And you will leave your name as a curse to my chosen ones; and the Lord Yahwah will slay you; and he will call his
servants by another name:
\v 16 Whoever pronounces a blessing on the earth will bless by the God of truth; and he who takes an oath on the earth
will swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles will be forgotten, and because I will no longer think about them..
