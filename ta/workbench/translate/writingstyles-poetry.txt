===== Description =====

Poetry is one of various way in which to use words to make it more beautiful and shows the feeling. It is used to express a stronger emotional feeling than simple non-poetic forms would express. Poetry is easier to remember and tends to last longer than ordinary speech.


**Some things commonly found in poetry**\\ 
  - Lots of figures of speech particularly metaphors, similes  and metonymys.   (See: Metaphor [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) Example of metaphor: All of them are bronze and iron, acting corruptly. (Jeremiah 6:28b)  Example of simile (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]: You cover yourself with light as with a garment; you spread out the heavens like a tent curtain. (Psalm 104:2) Example off metonymy (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]): But he saves the poor person from the sword in their mouths and the needy person from the hand of mighty people. (Job 5:15)
  - 	Parallel lines (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) Example: For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant planting;
  -	Repetition of some or all of a line. Example: Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his angel armies. Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars. (Psalm 148:2&3)
  -	An idea and the negative of that idea. Example: My son, do not forget my commands, and keep my teachings in your heart
  -	Speaking of objects or even abstract ideas as if they were living creatures (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) Example: The roads of Zion mourn (Lamentation 1:4a) or \v 20 Wisdom cries aloud in the street, (Proverbs 1:20a)
  -	Speaking to objects or even abstract ideas as if they were living creatures (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]]) Example: Lift up your heads, you gates; (Psalm 24:7a)
  -	The same sound used at the end or at the beginning of two or more lines. Example: Twinkle, twinkle little star. How I wonder what you are.
  -	The same sound repeated many times. Example: Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater.  
  -	Leaving part of the idea implicit. 
  -	The uses of old words or old expressions.
  -	Lines of very similar length. Example: Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. (1 Corinthians 13:4)

=== Some places to look for poetry in your language === 
  - Songs particularly old songs or ones used in children’s games
  - Religious ceremony or chants of a priests or witch doctors
  - Prayers, blessings and curses
  - Old legends

=== Elegant or fancy speech ===
Elegant or fancy speech is similar to poetry in that it uses beautiful language but not all the features of poetry in the language and not as much of the ones it does use. Popular orators in the language use elegant speech and is the probably the easiest source of text to study to find out what makes speech elegant in your language.


**Reasons this could be a translation issue:** \\ 
Different languages use poetry for different things. If a poetic form would not communicate the same meaning in your language you may need to write it without the poetry. \\ 
In some languages, using poetry for a particular passage would make the passage much more powerful.

=== Translation Principles (optional) ===
===== Examples from the Bible =====

The Bible uses poetry for songs, teaching and prophecy. Almost all of the books of the Old Testament have poetry in them and many of the books are completely poetry. 
  - Hebrew poetry usually has parallel lines (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]). Example: For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant planting; (Isiah 5:7a 
  - It has lots of figures of speech particularly metaphors, (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]. Example: When your eyes light upon the money, it is gone, and suddenly it takes up wings and flies off to the sky like an eagle. (proverbs 23:5)
  - similes Example: I will make her like the wilderness, like a parched land, (Hosea 2:3b)  (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  - metonymys Example: All this is because of the rebellion of Jacob, and because of the sins of the house of Israel. What was the reason for Jacob's rebellion? Was it not Samaria? (Micah 1:5a) See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  - Repetition of some or all of a line. Example: Oh, give thanks to Yahweh; for he is good, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever. Oh, give thanks to the God of gods, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever. Oh, give thanks to the Lord of lords, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever. (Psalm 136:1-3)
  - An idea and the negative of that idea. Example: A wicked man makes himself seem strong, but an upright person is careful about his actions. (Proverbs 21:29)
  - Speaking of objects or even abstract ideas as if they were living creatures (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) Example: Zion has spread her hands wide; (Lamentation 1:17)
  - Speaking to objects or even abstract ideas as if they were living creatures (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]]) Example: Awake, awake, put on your strength, Zion; put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, holy city; (Isaiah 52:1a)
  - It also often uses of old words or old expressions.

===== Translation Strategies =====
If your language can use poetry for a particular passage consider using it. These strategies are for if it is not good for your language to use poetry there.

  - Translate the poetry using your style of poetry.
  - Translate the poetry using your style of elegant speech.
  - Translate the poetry using  your style of ordinary speech. 

If you use poetry it may be more beautiful. \\ 
If you use ordinary speech it may be more clear and understandable.


===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied to Psalm 1:1,2=====

1. Translate the poetry using your style of poetry.\\

\q1 Happy is the person not encouraged to sin
\q1 Disrespect for God he will not begin
\q1 To those who laugh at God, he is no kin.\\

\q1 God is his constant delight
\q1 He does what God says is right
\q1He thinks of it all day and night\\

2. Translate the poetry using your style of elegant speech.\\

Do you want to be truly happy? Then don’t listen to the people who do not love God. Don’t join with people who plan to do evil things. And by all means, stay far away from those who laugh at God. Instead revel in God, constantly bathing yourself in His will.

3. Translate the poetry using your style of ordinary speech.
*
The people who do not listen to the advice of those who do obey God are really happy. They do not spend time with people who continually do evil things or those who do not respect   God. They think all the time about how they can please and obey him.
