===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Ho**  - This term is an interjection/exclamation used by prophets. “Ho” is the pronunciation in the original Hebrew. This word indicates strong emotion and warning. It could mean “ah”, “alas”, or “woe”, but in this case is probably used to draw attention to what is being said. Most English translations leave it out in this verse.
    * **daughter of Zion**  - This refers to the people of Jerusalem.  Since Jerusalem was the capital of Judah, it could refer to the people of Judah by extension.
    * **I/myself/He/my**  - These pronouns refer to Yahweh.
    * **encamp**  - This word literally means "to set up and use a camp."  It refers figuratively to  Yahweh's presence in the Tent of Meeting which was set up in the middle of Israel's camp during the exodus, and later to his presence in Solomon's temple.  Similarly, he is coming back to Jerusalem.
    * **you**  - People of Jerusalem.
    * **join**  - This word means to come into contact or union with.
    * **themselves**  - This pronoun refers to the nations.
    * **in that day** - This refers to the day in which these events occur.  Zechariah's prophecy may begin to be fulfilled in his own time, but this is ultimately referring to the Messiah dwelling in Jerusalem.  "In that day" often references end times. Prophecy can refer to multiple periods of time.
    * **midst**  - This word means "in the middle."
    * **me**  - This section is outside of the quotes and does not refer to Yahweh, but to the Messiah (Jesus) or to Zechariah.  See pronouns in 2:6-8.
