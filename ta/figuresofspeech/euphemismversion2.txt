====== Euphemism [ˈyo͞ofəˌmizəm] ======
A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant or embarrassing.

=====Purposes of Euphemism=====


=====Examples from English=====
“Adult beverages” refers to “beer or liquor.”\\ 
“He passed away” and “He departed” means “He died.”\\ 
“He slept with her” usually means “They had sexual relations with each other.”\\ 
“Bathroom” and “restroom” refer to a room that has a toilet in it.


=====Examples from the Bible=====
//Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,// Luke 1:26a (WEB)\\ 
Luke simply wrote __in the sixth month__ to refer to the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy. This euphemism avoids the word "pregnancy".

//and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying “You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased.”// Luke 3:22 (WEB)\\ 
Luke wrote that __a voice__ came from heaven. The word "voice" refers to God. (See Synecdoche). People often avoided saying God's name, not because he is unpleasant or embarrassing, but because he is holy.

//Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.//  Luke 7:37 (WEB)\\ 
When Luke wrote this, he referred to the woman as __a sinner__. Since all people are sinners, it did not mean simply that she was a sinner, but that she was notably immoral. He may have used the word "sinner" as a euphemism for a prostitute.


//who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.// Luke 9:31 (WEB)\\ 
Luke wrote of Jesus' "departure" as a euphemism for his death. It can be unpleasant to talk about death, so sometimes people use euphemisms that are not so harsh sounding.

//that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,// 1 Thes 4:4 (WEB)\\ 
When Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, he wrote about them controlling their own “bodies”. But what he probably meant is for them to control their sexual desires. Sometimes people feel embarrassed talking about sexual desires. For Paul, the word “bodies” was less embarrassing or offensive than a phrase like “sexual desires.” The TFT uses direct speech rather than the euphemism.

//But we don’t want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you don’t grieve like the rest, who have no hope.// 1 Thes 4:13 (WEB)\\ 
When Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, he wrote about fellow believers who were “asleep”. But what he meant is that they were dead. Sometimes people don't like to speak directly about death because it is unpleasant. For Paul, “asleep” was a more gentle way to speak about being dead. The TFT uses direct speech rather than the euphemism.
