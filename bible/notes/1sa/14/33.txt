\v 33 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, you
have dealt treacherously: roll a great stone to me this day.
\v 34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man
his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every
man his ox with him that night, and killed them there.
