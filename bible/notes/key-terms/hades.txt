====== Hades ======


===== Definition: =====


Hades is the place where the dead go after departing this life. Hebrew people used the word "Sheol" to describe the same place.


    * Hades has a place of comfort for those who have their sin forgiven by Christ. It is a place of torment for those who reject Christ.
    * When God performs the final judgment of all mankind, those rejecting Christ will depart to the "lake of fire."
