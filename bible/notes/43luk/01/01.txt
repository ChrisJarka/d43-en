====== Luke 1:1-4 ======

===== UnfoldingWord: =====

<sup>1</sup> Many people have **undertaken** to write an orderly **account** about those matters **which have been fulfilled** among **us**. <sup>2</sup> These events were reported to **us** by those who **from the beginning** were **eyewitnesses** and became **servants of the word**. <sup>3</sup> So, since I also have accurately **researched** everything that happened from the beginning, I thought it would be good for me to write it down for you in an orderly way, **most excellent Theophilus**, <sup>4</sup> so that you might know that the things which you were taught are true.

 ===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **undertaken** - This can also be translated as, “tried” or, “worked hard” or, “done their best.” Luke did not indicate whether or not they were successful.
  * **account** - That is, "narrative" or, "report" or, "true story."
  * **which have been fulfilled** -  That is, "that God caused to happen."
  * **us** - The word "us" in this section probably excludes Theophilus. See [tA: inclusive/exclusive]
  * **from the beginning** - That is, "from the beginning of these events."
  * **eyewitnesses** - That is, "people who personally saw these events happen."
  * **servants of the word** - That is, "people who taught God's message" or, "people who proclaimed the message about Jesus."
  * **researched** - That is, "investigated" or, "examined thoroughly."
  * **most excellent Theophilus** - Luke addressed this book to Theophilus, which means, "friend of God." It may have been a man's name, or simply a description of the man. Luke showed respect by calling him "most excellent." This greeting may also be put at the beginning of the first sentence. See [tA: translate names]
