\c 23
\p
\v 1 He that is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah.
\p
\v 2 A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the
assembly of Jehovah.
\p
\v 3 An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging
to them enter into the assembly of Jehovah for ever:
\v 4 because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired
against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.
\v 5 Nevertheless Jehovah your God would not listen to Balaam; but Jehovah your God turned the curse into a blessing to
thee, because Jehovah your God loved thee.
\v 6 You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days for ever.
\p
\v 7 You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother: you shall not abhor an Egyptian; because you was a sojourner in
his land.
\v 8 The children of the third generation that are born to them shall enter into the assembly of Jehovah.
\p
\v 9 When you go forth in camp against your enemies, then you shall keep you from every evil thing.
\v 10 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of that which chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad
out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:
\v 11 but it shall be, when evening comes on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come within
the camp.
\v 12 You shall have a place also wiyout the camp, whither you shall go forth abroad:
\v 13 and you shall have a paddle among your weapons; and it shall be, when you sit down abroad, you shall dig therewith,
and shall turn back and cover that which comes from thee:
\v 14 for Jehovah your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver thee, and to give up your enemies before thee;
therefore shall your camp be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.
\p
\v 15 You shall not deliver to his master a servant that is escaped from his master to thee:
\v 16 he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee, in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates, where it
pleases him best: you shall not oppress him.
\p
\v 17 There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.
\v 18 You shall not bring the hire of a harlot, or the wages of a dog, into the house of Jehovah your God for any vow: for even
both these are an abomination to Jehovah your God.
\p
\v 19 You shall not lend upon interest to your brother; interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of anything that is
lent upon interest.
\v 20 To a foreigner you may lend upon interest; but to your brother you shall not lend upon interest, that Jehovah your
God may bless you in all that you put your hand unto, in the land whither you go in to possess it.
\p
\v 21 When you shall vow a vow to Jehovah your God, you shall not be slack to pay it: for Jehovah your God will surely
require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.
\v 22 But if you shall forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.
\v 23 That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according as you have vowed to Jehovah your God, a
freewill-offering, which you have promised with your mouth.
\p
\v 24 When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure; but you
shall not put any in your vessel.
\v 25 When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not
move a sickle to your neighbor’s standing grain.
