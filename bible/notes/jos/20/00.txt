== Cities of Refuge ==

If a person was killed it was the duty of his relatives to kill the killer. But if he did not intend to kill that would be unfair  So God told them to make cities of refuge for a person who did not intend to kill, where his case would be solved legally: "Do this so that one who unintentionally kills a person can go there. These cities will be a place of refuge from anyone who seeks to avenge the blood of a person who was killed."
