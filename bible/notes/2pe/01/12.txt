\v 12 Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and are established in the truth which is with you.
\v 13 And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
\v 14 knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle comes swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified to me.
\v 15 Yea, I will give diligence that at every time you may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.
