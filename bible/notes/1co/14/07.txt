\v 7 If even lifeless instruments make a sound like a flute or harp do not make distinctive sounds, how will anyone know what is being played?
\v 8 For if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound, how will anyone prepare for battle?
\v 9 So it is with you, if you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone understand what you have said? You will be speaking into the air.
