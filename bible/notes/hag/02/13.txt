\v 13 Then Haggai asked them, "If someone becomes unacceptable to God by touching a corpse, and then he touches any of those foods, will the food also become unacceptable to God?"

\v 13 Then Haggai said, "If someone who is unclean because of death touches any of these things, do they become unclean?" The
priests answered and said, "Yes, they become unclean."
\v 14 So Haggai answered and said, "So it is with this people and this nation before me!—this is Yahweh's declaration—and so it is with everything done by their hands: what they offer to me is unclean.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **because of death** - "because he has touched a dead body"
  * **So Haggai answered and said, "So it is ... is unclean** - Haggai answers the priests with the words that Yahweh told Haggai to tell the priests. AT: "So Haggai answered and told them Yahweh's words: 'So it is ... is unclean"
  * **So it is with this people and this nation before me** - "I look at this people and this nation the same way." Yahweh reminds the priests that a clean thing that touches an unclean thing becomes unclean. He then reminds them that he thinks of them as unclean because they have been worshiping idols, and so everything they touch and make becomes unclean.
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:hag:01:07|1:9]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
