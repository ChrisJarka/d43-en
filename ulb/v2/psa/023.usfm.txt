\c 23
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want.
\q
\v 2 He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
\q He leads me beside still waters.
\q
\v 3 He restoreth my soul:
\q He guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his nameâ€™s sake.
\q
\v 4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
\q I will fear no evil; for you are with me;
\q Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
\q
\v 5 You preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
\q You have anointed my head with oil;
\q My cup runs over.
\q
\v 6 Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life;
\q And I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for ever.
