\v 1 The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s.
\q
\v 2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;
\q For your love is better than wine.
\q
\v 3 Your oils have a goodly fragrance;
\q Your name is as oil poured forth;
\q Therefore do the virgins love thee.
\q
\v 4 Draw me; we will run after thee:
\q The king has brought me into his chambers;
\q We will be glad and rejoice in thee;
\q We will make mention of your love more than of wine:
\q Rightly do they love thee.
\q
\v 5 I am black, but comely,
\q Oh you daughters of Jerusalem,
\q As the tents of Kedar,
\q As the curtains of Solomon.
\q
\v 6 Look not upon me, because I am swarthy,
\q Because the sun has scorched me.
\q My mother’s sons were incensed against me;
\q They made me keeper of the vineyards;
\q But mine own vineyard have I not kept.
\q
\v 7 Tell me, O you whom my soul loveth,
\q Where you feedest your flock,
\q Where you make it to rest at noon:
\q For why should I be as one that is veiled
\q Beside the flocks of your companions?
\b
\q
\v 8 If you know not, O you fair among women,
\q Go your way forth by the footsteps of the flock,
\q And feed your kids beside the shepherds’ tents.
\b
\q
\v 9 I have compared thee, O my love,
\q To a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.
\q
\v 10 Your cheeks are comely with plaits of hair,
\q Your neck with strings of jewels.
\q
\v 11 We will make you plaits of gold
\q With studs of silver.
\q
\v 12 While the king sat at his table,
\q My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.
\q
\v 13 My beloved is to me as a bundle of myrrh,
\q That lies between my breasts.
\q
\v 14 My beloved is to me as a cluster of henna-flowers
\q In the vineyards of En-gedi.
\b
\q
\v 15 Behold, you are fair, my love;
\q Behold you are fair;
\q Your eyes are as doves.
\b
\q
\v 16 Behold, you are fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant:
\q Also our couch is green.
\q
\v 17 The beams of our house are cedars,
\q And our rafters are firs.
