===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They stood** - "The daughters of Zelophehad stood"
  * **Eleazar** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:num:03:01|3:2]].
  * **gathered together against Yahweh** - The people in the company of Korah gathered together and rebelled against Yahweh. Yahweh caused them to die, because of their sin. AT: "who died because they were among Korah's followers who rebelled against Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **He died in his own sin; instead, it was because of his own sin that he died** - The phrase "died in his own sin" means that he died because he was guilty of his own sins. This statement is repeated to emphasize that their father died in the wilderness along with his generation, but not because he rebelled with Korah. AT: "He died because of his own sin"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
