==== Translation Principles  (optional) ====

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**ULB Text.** (Book c:v ) - Explanation of how this is an example \\ 
**You cannot serve God and wealth.** (Matthew 6:24 ) - Jesus speaks of wealth as if it were a master whom people might serve. Loving money and basing our decisions on it is like serving it as a slave would serve his master.  \\ 
**Does not Wisdom call out? Does not Understanding raise her voice?** (Proverbs 8:1) -  The author speaks of wisdom and understanding as if they are a woman who calls out to teach people. They are not something hidden, but something obvious that people should pay attention to. \\  
**Discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you.** (Proverbs 2:11 ) -  The author speaks of discretion and understanding as if they could watch over and guard you. If you have discretion and understanding you will be safe because you will not do foolish things that could hurt you.

A numbered list of examples that match the strategies above. Each strategy should have an example - even if the first strategy is to maintain the  form or figure. Each strategy should have only one  example because of  challenges with the Door43 formatting. \\

**The ULB  Text in bold [underline words of issue]** (Bible Reference) Explanation of application of strategy 
"Sample of Bible after strategy is applied." [underline words of issue] 
for example: 

1. Simply put the adjective or relative clause in a separate sentence.  \\ 
**I hate those who serve __worthless idols__ ** (Psalm 31:6)  When David spoke of "worthless idols," he was acknowledging that idols are worthless. He was not distinguishing worthless idols from valuable idols.  \\ 
"I hate those who serve idols. Idols are worthless."   \\ 

2. Put the  adjective or relative clause in a separate phrase with words that show why the information is important. \\ 
**I will call on __Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised__**  (2 Samuel 22:4) There is only one Yahweh. The phrase "who is worthy to be praised" gives a reason for calling on Yahweh. This can be shown with the word "because."  \\ 
"I will call on Yahweh, because he is worthy to be praised"
