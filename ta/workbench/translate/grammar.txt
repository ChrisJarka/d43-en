====== Grammar Topics ======

I'm trying to make this a simple directory to the big grammar/syntax topics.

**Sentences**\\
When we speak, we organize our thoughts in sentences. A sentence usually has a complete thought about an event or a situation or state of being. (See: ([[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences]])\\ 
 
**Active and Passive Sentences**
Some languages have both active and passive sentences. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * ACTIVE: My father built the house in 2010. 
  * PASSIVE: The house was built in 2010. 

**Parts of Speech**\\ 
All words in a language belong to a category called a  part of speech.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech]])\\ 

**Possession** - (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genitivecase]])

**Quotations** \\ 
A quotation is a report of what someone else has said.  \\ 
Quotations normally have two parts: Information about who said something and what the person said. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_quotations]]) \\ 
Quotations can be either direct quotes and indirect quotes  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * He said, “I will come.” (Direct Quotation)
  * He said that he would come. (Indirect Quotation)
