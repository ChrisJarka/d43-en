\v 37 Neither does anyone put freshly-\add squeezed\add* grape juice into old skin bags \add to store it\add*. If anyone did that, the grape juice would burst the skin bags \add because they would not stretch when the\add* new \add wine ferments and expands. Then\add* the skin bags would be ruined, and\add the wine\add* would\add also\add* be spilled.
\v 38 On the contrary, new wine must be put into new wineskins.

\v 39 Furthermore, those who have drunk \add only\add* old wine \add are content with that\add*. They do not want to drink the new wine, because they say, 'The old wine is \f + \ft metaphor \f* good!'~"

\v 37 And no one puts newly-squeezed wine into old skin bags to store it. If anyone did that, the skin bags would tear open because they would not stretch when the new wine fermented and expanded. Then the skin bags would be ruined, and the wine would also be ruined because it would spill out..
\v 38 On the contrary, new wine must be put into new skin bags.
\p
\v 39 Furthermore, those who have drunk only old wine are content with that. They do not want to drink the new wine, because they say, 'The old wine is  good!'"
