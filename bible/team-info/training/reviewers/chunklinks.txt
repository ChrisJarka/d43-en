====== Verse Link Code ======

This page will guide you to creating links to verses in the Bible notes.

==== Template: ====

The generic code is as follows:

<code>
See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:bok:ch:vv|c:v]].
</code>

In the above example, the symbols to the left of the vertical bar (|) represent the URL of the target chunk. It must be entered exactly, including leading zeros:
  * bok = the three-letter code for the book
  * ch = the two-digit chapter number (except in Psalms, where it must be three digits)
  * vv = the two-digit verse number

The symbols to the right of the vertical bar (|) represent what appears in the visible green text in the note. I does not need leading zeros:
  * c = the chapter number
  * v = the verse number

**Note** The "vv" and "v" numbers will only match when the target verse is the first verse in the chunk (and therefore the URL of the chunk). If the verse is not the first verse of the chunk, the "vv" number __must be adjusted__ to the first verse of the chunk!
