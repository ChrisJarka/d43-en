===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will ... shake the heavens ... the earth ... the sea ... the dry land ... every nation** - The words "I will shake the earth" could be translated as "I will cause an earthquake," and that earthquake would shake "the sea" as well as "the dry land," a merism for the entire earth. Yahweh speaks of the heavens and every nation as if they also were solid objects that he could shake. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **shake** - Use the verb you usually use for pushing trees back and forth to get fruit or other objects to fall from them.
  * **I will fill this house with glory** - Yahweh speaks of glory as if it were a solid or liquid that could be put into a container, the temple. Possible meanings are 1) the temple will become very beautiful. AT: "I will make this house very beautiful" or 2) the "precious things" that "every nation will bring" include much silver and gold and other forms of wealth. AT: "I will have people bring many beautiful things into this house" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
