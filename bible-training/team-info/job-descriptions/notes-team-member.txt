====== Notes Team Member ======


==== Team Purpose ====

Each Notes team will systematically work through each verse of their assigned book of the Bible and identify the significant issues that may difficulty in translating that verse. The team will address these issues in the following ways:

  * Identify and list Important Terms
  * Write concise, helpful explanatory notes on each word or phrase that is unclear or difficult to translate
  * Identify and correct problems in the UDB and ULB text that hinder clear, accurate translation

All of the content developed will be released as open-source, unrestricted materials. No copyrighted materials should be included in their creation. It is also understood that the team agrees to have the product of their work freely distributed as open-source.


==== Team Member Responsibilities ==== 

Each member of a Notes team will faithfully interact with other team members in the discussion area of their assigned chapter several times per week. The following attitudes are important:

  * Be considerate and civil - we have a lot of work to do on an intense deadline
  * Be humble - the other people on your team are knowledgable
  * Be thorough - take the time to surface and discuss all important topics
  * Be willing to compromise - we will not always be unanimous in decisions, but will try to let consensus rule

Each member will agree to follow the instructions of and schedule set by their team leader.
