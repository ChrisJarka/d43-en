\v 7 Be you prepared, yea, prepare yourself, you, and all your companies that are assembled to thee, and be you a guard to
them.
\v 8 After many days you shall be visited: in the latter years you shall come into the land that is brought back from the
sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought
forth out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.
\v 9 And you shall ascend, you shall come like a storm, you shall be like a cloud to cover the land, you, and all your
hordes, and many peoples with thee.
