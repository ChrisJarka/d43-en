\v 33 "Think about this: You can know whether \add a person is good and what that person says is good, in the same way that you\add* can know whether a tree \f + \ft metaphor \f* and the fruit it produces \f + \ft metaphor \f* are good. \add You can also know whether a person and what that person says is evil in the same way that you can know\add* whether a tree \f + \ft metaphor \f* and its fruit \f + \ft metaphor \f* are blighted. You can know whether a tree is good by \add seeing\add* its fruit, and similarly \add people can know the evil character of you Pharisees by listening to your accusations against me\add*.
\v 34 \add What\add* you \add teach harms people spiritually like poisonous\add* snakes \add harm them physically\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! You are not able to speak good things because you are evil \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. Evil people \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add like you\add* speak what comes from all that is in their inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*.
\v 35 Good people \add speak good things. That is like\add* taking good things out of buildings where they are stored. But evil people \add speak evil things. That is like\add* taking evil things out of buildings where they are stored.

\v 33 "When you see some fruit from a tree, you decide whether the fruit is good or bad. If it is good, then you know that its tree is also good. If I am doing good things, then you should know whether or not I am good.
\v 34 You are like the children of poisonous snakes. You cannot say anything good, because what a person says shows what is in his heart.
\v 35 Good people speak good things. That is like taking good things out of buildings where people keep them. But evil people speak evil things. That is like taking evil things out of buildings where they are stored.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 33 Either make a tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt, for a tree is known by its fruit.
\v 34 You offspring of vipers, since you are evil, how can you say good things? For out of the content of the heart the mouth
speaks.
\v 35 The good man from the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man from the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil.
