\v 17 And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said to them,
\v 18 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes; and they shall
condemn him to death,
\v 19 and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall be raised up.
