===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 2 For the married woman is bound by the Law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is released from the law of the husband.
\v 3 So then if, while the husband lives, she becomes joined to another man, she will be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, though she is joined to another man.
