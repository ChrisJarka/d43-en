===== Bible Examples =====

=== Rut:02:12 ===

"May Yahweh reward you for your deed. May you receive full payment from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have found refuge."

  * **May you receive full payment from Yahweh**  - This is a poetic expression that is very similar to the previous sentence. It could be translated as "May Yahweh give back to you even more than you have given." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:parallelism|Parallelism]])

=== Rut:02:19 ===

"And her mother-in-law said to her, "Where have you gleaned today? And where did you go to work?"

  * **"Where have you gleaned today. And where did you go to work?**  - The Hebrews often repeated thing in different words as a way of emphasis. (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])

=== Luk:12:02 ===

"But there is nothing concealed, that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden, that will not be known."

  * **and nothing hidden, that will not be made known**  - This part of the sentence uses different words to say the same thing as the first part in order to emphasize its truth. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:parallelism|Parallelism]])
