\v 24 And it shall come to pass, if you diligently listen to me, says Jehovah, to bring in no burden through the gates of
this city on the sabbath day, but to hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;
\v 25 then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in
chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall remain
for ever.
