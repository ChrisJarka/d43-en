\v 9 Thus says Jehovah, Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart.
\v 10 For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men
among them, yet would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
