====== Active or Passive ======

The English language has the active and passive form of speech.

    * In the **ACTIVE**  form, the subject does the action.
    * In the **PASSIVE**  form, the action is done to the subject.


==== Examples ====

**Active** - Peter built the house.\\
**Passive** - The house was built by Peter.\\

**Active** - Worms ate the apple.\\
**Passive** - The apple was eaten by worms.\\


==== Who or What is the subject? ====

  * In the **ACTIVE** form, the subject that does the action is always mentioned.
  * In the **PASSIVE** form, the subject that does the action is //not always// mentioned.

To change a **PASSIVE** form to an **ACTIVE** form it is necessary to state who, or what, did the action.\\
For example:\\
**Active** - .... and when Jesus was baptized.\\
**Passive** - ... and when //John// baptized Jesus.\\
