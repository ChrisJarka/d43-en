\v 1 Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession-- Jesus.
\v 2 He was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.
\v 3 For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who builds the house has more honor than the house.
\v 4 For every house is built by someone; but he who built everything is God.
