\v 22 You want to go to Egypt and live there. So now, you can be sure of this: All of you will die there. Some of you will be killed by the swords \add of your enemies\add* and others will die from famines or from diseases."

\v 20 I know that you were lying when you requested me to pray to Yahweh our God and claimed to be willing to obey everything he said.
\v 21 So today I have told you exactly what he said, but I know that you will not obey Yahweh our God now, just as you have not obeyed him previously.
\v 22 You want to go to Egypt and live there. So now, you can be sure of this: All of you will die there. Some of you will be killed by the swords of your enemies and others will die from famines or from diseases."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 For you have erred within your souls since you yourselves sent me to Yahweh your God and said, ‘Intercede on our behalf to Yahweh our God and everything Yahweh our God says, report to us and we will do it!’
\v 21 For I have reported to you this day but you have not listened to the voice of Yahweh your God or to anything for which he sent me to you!
\v 22 So now you will certainly know that you will die by sword, famine, and plague in the place where you desired to go to sojourn there!”
</usfm>
