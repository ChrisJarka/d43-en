===== The Bible =====

==== Overview ====

The Bible is God's Holy Word. As such, it is the only inspired, inerrant, sufficient, authoritative Word of God. God speaks to His people through the Bible so it is very important that people be able to understand the Bible in the language their heart speaks. 

Bible translation has been happening for a long time, but there are still a very large number of languages that do not have a complete Bible translation and many more languages that do not have any of God's Word at all. Instead of waiting for missionaries to come and do Bible translations in all these languages, many churches around the world are tired of waiting and want to start Bible translation now. To help assist our brothers and sisters in Christ, we have developed these tools, helps, and checking levels to help them make accurate, high-quality translations that are free from copyright restrictions. By using these resources, we believe that Bible translations can be done very quickly and well. 

==== Translation Notes ====

The unfoldingWord team is in the process of creating a complete set of translation notes that will help translators do the best translation possible.
