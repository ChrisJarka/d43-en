\v 12 Similarly, Jesus suffered \add and died\add* outside the gate \add of Jerusalem\add* in order that he might make \add us\add*, his people, holy by \add offering\add* his own blood \add as a sacrifice to atone for our sins\add*.
\p
\v 13 So, we must abandon \add performing Jewish\add* sacrifices and rituals \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add in order to be saved\add*, and let us go to Jesus \add to be saved\add*. As we do that, we must \add be willing to\add* let others reproach us just like people reproached him.
\v 14 Here on earth, we believers do not have a city \add such as Jerusalem where we must\add* continually \add offer sacrifices\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Instead, we are waiting for a future \add heavenly\add* city \add that will last forever\add*.

\v 12 Similarly, Jesus suffered and died outside the gates of Jerusalem in order that he might make us, his people, special for God. He did this by offering his own blood as a sacrifice for our sins.
\p
\v 13 So we must go to Jesus to be saved; we must allow others to insult us just like people insulted him.
\v 14 Here on earth, we believers do not have a city such as Jerusalem. Instead, we are waiting for the heavenly city that will last forever.

\v 12 Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the city gate, in order to sanctify the people through his own blood.
\v 13 Let us therefore go to him outside the camp, bearing his disgrace.
\v 14 For we do not have any permanent city here. Instead we seek the city that is to come.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the city gate, in order to sanctify the people through his own blood**  - Jesus atoning sacrifice is compared here, as higher and better, with the Tabernacle and Temple sacrifices  [[en:bible:notes:heb:13:09]]. Jesus own blood is compared here with that of those sacrificial animals. The Holy Place where the High Priest takes the blood of sacrificial animals is compared to the Heavenly Holy Place where Jesus took his own atoning blood. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
