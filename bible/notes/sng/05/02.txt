<usfm>
\q
\v 2 I was asleep, but my heart was awake in a dream.
\q There is the sound of my beloved knocking and saying,
\q "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled one,
\q for my head is wet with dew,
\q my hair with the night's dampness."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Here begins Part Four of the book

  * **General Information:** - The young woman uses euphemisms to describe her dream so that it can be interpreted in two different ways: 1) the woman describes a dream about a night when the man came to visit her at her house; and 2) the woman describes a dream about starting to sleep with the man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])

  * **but my heart was awake** - The heart is the center of thought and feeling. AT: "but I could think clearly" or "but I knew what I was feeling" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **beloved** - Some versions understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman (see UDB), but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13]].
  * **Open to me** - Possible meanings are 1) literal, "Open the door for me," or 2) metaphorical, "Let me make love to you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my sister** - This is an idiom of affection. They are not actually brother and sister. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:04:09|4:9]]. AT: "my dear" or "my darling" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

  * **dew** - drops of water or mist that form as the night becomes cool
  * **my hair with the night's dampness** - You may need to supply the words omitted by the ellipsis. AT: "my hair is wet with the night's dampness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
