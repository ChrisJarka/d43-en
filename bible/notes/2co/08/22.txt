\v 22 And we sent our brother with them, whom we have often seen to be diligent in many things, but now even more diligent because of the level of confidence that he has in you.
\v 23 As for Titus, he is my partner and a co-worker for you; as for our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.
\v 24 So show proof of your love for them openly and of our reason for boasting about you in the churches.
