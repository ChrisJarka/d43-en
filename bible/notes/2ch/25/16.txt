\v 16 It came about that as the prophet was speaking with him, the king said to him, "Have we made you an advisor to the king? Stop! Why should you be killed?" Then the prophet stopped and said, "I know that God has decided to destroy you because you have done this deed and have not listened to my advice."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **It came about that** - This phrase is used here to mark the next important event in the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **Have we made you an advisor to the king? Stop! Why should you be killed?** - The king used these rhetorical questions to rebuke the prophet for speaking against him. The questions can be translated as statements. AT: "We certainly did not appoint you to be one of my advisors. So stop talking! If you say anything more, I will tell my soldiers to kill you!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you have done this deed** - This refers back to Amaziah worshiping the gods of the Edomites in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:25:14|25:14]].
