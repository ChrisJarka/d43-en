  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

A doublet is a pair of words used together that mean nearly the same nearly thing. In some languages people do not use doublets, or they may use them only in certain situations. Translators may need to find some other way to express the meaning.
  * **King David was __old__ and __advanced in years__.** (1 Kings 1:1)  \\ 
    * The underlined words mean the same thing. Together they mean "very old".
===== Description =====
We are using the word doublet to refer to two words or very short phrases that mean the same thing and that are used in the same phrase. Often they are joined with the word “and.” Often they are used to emphasize or intensify the idea expressed by the two words.  

**Reason this is a translation issue:** In some languages people do not use doublets. Or they may use doublets, but they may do it for a reason that would not fit in a particular verse. 
 
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**King David was old and advanced in years.** (1 Kings 1:1)  \\ 
This means that he was “very old.” 

**he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself** (1 Kings 2:32)  \\ 
This means that they were “much more righteous” than he was. 

**You have decided to prepare false and deceptive words** (Daniel 2:9) \\ 
This means that they had prepared “many false things to say”. 

**as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.** (1 Peter 1:19)  \\ 
This means that he was like a lamb that did not have any blemish--not even one. 
 
===== Translation Strategies ===== 
If a doublet would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using one. If not, consider these strategies. 
 
  - Translate only one of the words.
  - If the doublet is used to intensify the meaning, translate one of the words and add a word that intensifies it such as “very” or “great” or “many”. 
  - If the doublet is used to intensify or emphasize the meaning, use your culture's way of doing that. 
 
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ===== 
1. Translate only one of the phrases and add a word that intensifies it such as “very” or “great” or “many”. 
  * **You have decided to prepare false and deceptive words** (Daniel 2:9 ) 
    * "You have decided to prepare many false things to say”. 

2. Use your own culture's way of emphasizing or intensifying the concept. 
  * **a lamb without blemish and without spot.** (1 Peter 1:19) - English can emphasize this with "any" and "at all." 
    * "a lamb without any blemish at all"
