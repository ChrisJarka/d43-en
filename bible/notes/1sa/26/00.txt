====== 1 Samuel 26 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This begins a subsection (1 Samuel 27-29) of David living with the Philistines.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

David was afraid that Saul would someday catch him and kill him so he moved to the Philistine city of Gath. He and his men would raid the people living near Egypt and kill everyone but keep the animals and clothes. He would tell the king he had raided the south of Judah. So the king trusted him because he thought the Israeli people must hate David for raiding them.
