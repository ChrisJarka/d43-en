\v 4 Ben Hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim  , and all the storage cities of Naphtali.
\v 5 It came about that when Baasha heard this, he stopped building up Ramah, and let his work cease.
\v 6 Then Asa the king took all Judah with him. They carried away the stones and timbers of Ramah with which Baasha had been building up the city. Then King Asa used that building material to build up Geba and Mizpah.
