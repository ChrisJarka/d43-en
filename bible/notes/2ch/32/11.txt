\v 11 Is not Hezekiah persuading you, in order to hand you over to death by famine and by thirst. Is he not saying, ‘Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria’?
\v 12 Is it not this same Hezekiah who has taken away Yahweh's shrines and altars, and who has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem?'
