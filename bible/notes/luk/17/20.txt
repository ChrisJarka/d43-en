===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Being asked by the pharisees**  - This can be translated with an active verb. "The Pharisees asked Jesus." (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:active]])  This is the beginning of a new part of the story. Some translations start it with "One day" (UDB) or "Once." 
    * **when the kingdom of God would come**  - This can be translated with a direct quote: "When will the kingdom of God come?" (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:quotation]])
    * **The kingdom of God does not come with observation**  - Possible meanings are 1) "People will not be able to see the coming of the kingdom of God" or 2) "People will not be able to see the kingdom of God." We recommend the first. It can be translated as "People will not know when God begins to reign."
    * **The kingdom of God is within you** - Possible meanings are 1) "The kingdom of God is among you" or 2) "The kingdom of God is in your hearts." We recommend the first. It can be translated as "The kingdom of God is here" or "God has already begun to rule among you."
