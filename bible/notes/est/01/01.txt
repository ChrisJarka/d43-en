\v 1 Memucan answered before the king and the princes, "Vashti the queen has not only wronged  the king, but also to all the princes, and to all the people of all the provinces of  King Ahasuerus.
\v 17 For this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing  them to treat their husbands with contempt. It will be reported," King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be ushered in before him, but she refused.
\v 18 This very day the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of this incident with the queen will say the same thing to all the kingâ€™s princes. So there will  arise much contempt and anger.
