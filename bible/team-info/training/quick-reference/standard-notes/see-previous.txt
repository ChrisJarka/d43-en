====== See how you translated this ... ======

We often see a phrase repeated throughout a book. It would be good if the translators would translate that phrase consistently. So rather than write a note explaining the phrase each time it occurs, we prefer to direct the translators to see how they they translated it before. 

If the idea in the phrase is pretty simple, they may be able to keep translating it the way they translate it the first time. But if the idea is new to their readers, the translators might take more words to explain it the first time. The second time the phrase occurs, they should see how they translated it the first time, and then they might then shorten the phrase for the second occurrence. When the phrase occurs again, they should look at how they translated it the second time. So it would be good for jus to give links to the second time the phrase is used in the book.
