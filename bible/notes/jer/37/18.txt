\v 18 Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against your servants, or against this
people, that you have put me in prison?
\v 19 Where now are your prophets that prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against
this land?
\v 20 And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be presented before thee, that you
cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
