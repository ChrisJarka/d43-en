===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I am \add like\add* a good shepherd. \add Just like a good shepherd knows his\add* sheep \f + \ft metaphor \f*, I know those who belong to me, and they know me
\v 15 in the same way as \add my\add* Father knows me and I know \add my\add* Father. Furthermore, I am \add ready to\add* sacrifice myself for \add those who belong to me\add*.
\v 16 And I have other people \add who are not Jews\add* who \add will some day\add* belong to me. They will be \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* sheep from another sheep pen. I must bring them \add to God\f + \ft Or: myself \f*\add* also. They will pay attention to what I say, and eventually \add all those who belong to me\add* will be \add like\add* one flock, and \add I\add* will be \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* their one shepherd.

\v 14 I am the good shepherd. I know my own sheep and my own sheep know me,
\v 15 just as I know my Father and my Father knows me. Out of that connection between me and the Father, I willingly lay down my life for my sheep.

\v 14 I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me.
\v 15 The Father knows me, and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.
\v 16 And I have other  sheep which are not of this fold.  Those, also, I must bring, and they shall hear my voice so that there shall be one flock and one shepherd.
