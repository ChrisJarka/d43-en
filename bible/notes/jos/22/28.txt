<usfm>
\v 28 In the future, if your descendants say that, our descendants can say, 'Look at the altar that our ancestors made! It is exactly like Yahweh's altar \add at Shiloh\add*, but we do not burn sacrifices on it. It only shows that we are Israelites!'
\v 29 We certainly do not want to rebel against Yahweh or stop doing what he desires, by building an altar for completely burning some sacrifices and burning grain offerings and making \add other\add* sacrifices. \add We know that\add* there is only one true altar for Yahweh our God, and it is in front of the Sacred Tent \add at Shiloh\add*."

\v 29 We certainly do not want to rebel against Yahweh or stop doing what he desires, by building an altar for completely burning some sacrifices and burning flour offerings and making other sacrifices. We know that there is only one true altar for Yahweh our God, and it is in front of the Sacred Tent at Shiloh."

\v 28 So we said, 'If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come, we should say, 'Look! The copy of the altar of Yahweh, which our ancestors made, not for burned offerings, nor for sacrifices, but it is a witness between us and you."
\v 29 Be it far from us that we should rebel against Yahweh, and turn away this day from following Yahweh by building an altar for burnt offering, for grain offering, or for sacrifice, other than the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his Tabernacle.
