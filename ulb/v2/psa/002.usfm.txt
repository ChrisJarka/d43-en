\c 2
\p
\v 1 Why do the nations rage,
\q And the peoples meditate a vain thing?
\q
\v 2 The kings of the earth set themselves,
\q And the rulers take counsel together,
\q Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, saying,
\q
\v 3 Let us break their bonds asunder,
\q And cast away their cords from us.
\q
\v 4 He that sits in the heavens will laugh:
\q The Lord will have them in derision.
\q
\v 5 Then will he speak to them in his wrath,
\q And vex them in his sore displeasure:
\q
\v 6 Yet I have set my king
\q Upon my holy hill of Zion.
\q
\v 7 I will tell of the decree:
\q Jehovah said to me, You are my son;
\q This day have I begotten thee.
\q
\v 8 Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for your inheritance,
\q And the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
\q
\v 9 You shall break them with a rod of iron;
\q You shall dash them in pieces like a potterâ€™s vessel.
\b
\q
\v 10 Now therefore be wise, O you kings:
\q Be instructed, you judges of the earth.
\q
\v 11 Serve Jehovah with fear,
\q And rejoice with trembling.
\q
\v 12 Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way,
\q For his wrath will soon be kindled.
\q Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.
