\v 27 Gideon made an ephod out of the earrings and put it in his city, in Ophrah, and all Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there. It became a trap for Gideon and for those in his house.
\v 28 So Midian was subdued before the people of Israel and they did not raise their heads up again. And the land had peace for forty years in the days of Gideon.
