\v 34 \add Someone in\add* the crowd answered him, "We understand from the Scriptures that the Messiah will live forever.

What kind of man who came from heaven are you\add talking about\add*? \f + \ft Or: That's not the \add kind\add* of Messiah \add we are expecting\add*! \f*"

\v 34 The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains for ever: and how say thou,
The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
\v 35 Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness
overtake you not: and he that walks in the darkness knows not whither he goeth.
\v 36 While you have the light, believe on the light, that you may become sons of light.
\p These things spoke Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.
