\v 5 Out in the sea, the part of your city that is on an island will become a place where men spread their fishing nets to dry them. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh the Lord, have predicted it: People from many nations carry off everything of value in your city.
\v 6 The people in small villages on the coast near Tyre--your enemies will kill them with their swords. Then people will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **She will become** - Cities are often referred to as "she." Alternate translation: "Tyre will become" or "It will become."
  * **a place for nets to dry out in the midst of the sea** - People would use nets to catch fish. When they were done they would leave the nets in an empty place to dry in the sun. Yahweh is emphasizing that there will be nothing left in Tyre after he punishes them. Alternate translation: "an empty island" or "completely deserted island."

  * **she will become plunder for the nations** - Here "nations" refers to the armies from the nations. Alternate translation: "armies from the nations will take everything from Tyre." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **Her daughters who are in the field will be slaughtered by the swords** - Alternate translation: "The armies will even kill the women who are out in the field." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
