====== leprosy, leper ======


===== Definition: =====


In the Bible, "leprosy" is a term used for many different skin diseases. When a person had one of these skin diseases, he was considered unclean.


    * A "leper" is a person who has leprosy.
    * Lepers were isolated from other people in areas outside of the encampment or town.
    * Today there is another disease called leprosy, or Hansen's disease. It is a chronic, curable, infectious disease that affects the skin and nerves, and frequently causes deformity.
    * Leprosy in the Bible could be translated as "skin disease" or "dreaded skin disease." If possible use a word that is different from the name of the modern disease.
