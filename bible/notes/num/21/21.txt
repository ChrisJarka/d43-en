\v 21 And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
\v 22 Let me pass through your land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the kingâ€™s highway, until we have passed your border.
\v 23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel.
