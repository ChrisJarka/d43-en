\v 4 Like a woman who is unfaithful to her husband, you are being unfaithful to God and not obeying him anymore. Those who behave as evil people do belong to this world and are enemies against God. Perhaps you do not realize that.
\v 5 Surely you do not think that it is for no reason that God told us in the Scriptures that the Spirit he placed in us yearns for us  to live our lives in ways that please him.

\v 4 You adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility against God? Therefore, whoever decides to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
\v 5 Or do you think the scripture is without meaning when it says that the Spirit he placed within us is deeply jealous for us?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You adulteresses!** - This compares believers who do not obey God with a wife who sleeps with a man who is not her husband. AT: "You are not being loyal to God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Do you not know...God?** - James uses this question to teach his audience. AT: "You know...God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **friendship with the world** - This phrase "friendship with the world" refers to identifying with or participating in the world's value system and behavior. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]).
  * **friendship with the world is hostility against God** - To be part of the world's value system is to be against God. AT: "to act as those who dishonor God is to be someone who opposes God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Or do you think the scripture is useless** - This is a rhetorical question James uses to exhort his audience. AT: "Scripture is true."
  * **the spirit God placed in us is now filled with deep longing** - There are several issues that are not clear in this verse. Is "spirit" the Holy Spirit or a human spirit? Does God or the spirit have the "deep longing"? Is the "deep longing" good or evil? Does the question expect a "yes" or "no" answer? This uncertainty results in at least five possible meanings: 1) "yes, God deeply longs for the human spirit he put in us" or 2) "yes, God deeply longs for the Holy Spirit he place in us" or 3) "yes, the human spirit that God placed in us has evil desires" or 4) "yes, the Holy Spirit that God placed in us deeply longs for us" or 5) "no, the Holy Spirit that God placed in us is not jealous." We suggest that you use the meaning that is presented in other translations used by your readers.
