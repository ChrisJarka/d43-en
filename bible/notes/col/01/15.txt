\v 15 He is the image of the invisible God. He is the firstborn of all creation
\v 16 because all things were created in him, those in the heavens and those on the earth, the visible and the invisible. Whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities, all things were created through him and for him.
\v 17 He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
