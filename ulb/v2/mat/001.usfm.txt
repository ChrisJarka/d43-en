\v 1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
\p
\v 2 Abraham became the father of Isaac; and Isaac became the father of Jacob; and Jacob became the father of Judah and his brethren;
\v 3 and Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez became the father of Hezron; and Hezron became the father of Ram;
\v 4 and Ram became the father of Amminadab; and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon; and Nahshon became the father of Salmon;
\v 5 and Salmon became the father of Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz became the father of Obed of Ruth; and Obed became the father of Jesse;
\v 6 and Jesse became the father of David the king.
\p And David became the father of Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah;
\v 7 and Solomon became the father of Rehoboam; and Rehoboam became the father of Abijah; and Abijah became the father of Asa;
\v 8 and Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram; and Joram became the father of Uzziah;
\v 9 and Uzziah became the father of Jotham; and Jotham became the father of Ahaz; and Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah;
\v 10 and Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh; and Manasseh became the father of Amon; and Amon became the father of Josiah;
\v 11 and Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.
\p
\v 12 And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel; and Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel;
\v 13 and Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud; and Abiud became the father of Eliakim; and Eliakim became the father of Azor;
\v 14 and Azor became the father of Sadoc; and Sadoc became the father of Achim; and Achim became the father of Eliud;
\v 15 and Eliud became the father of Eleazar; and Eleazar became the father of Matthan; and Matthan became the father of Jacob;
\v 16 and Jacob became the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
\p
\v 17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the carrying away to Babylon
fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.
\p
\v 18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came
together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away
privily.
\v 20 But when he yought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, you son
of David, fear not to take to you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 And she shall bring forth a son; and you shall call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their
sins.
\v 22 Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
\q
\v 23 Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
\q And they shall call his name Immanuel;
\m which is, being interpreted, God with us.
\v 24 And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took to him his wife;
\v 25 and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.
