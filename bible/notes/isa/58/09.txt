===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Then you will call, and Yahwah will answer; you will cry out, and he will say, "Here I am."
\p If you take away from among you the yoke, the accusing finger, and the malicious speech;
\v 10 and if you provide for the hungry, and satisfy the need of the distressed; then your light will rise in the darkness,
like the noonday sun.
</usfm>
