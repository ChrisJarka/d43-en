\v 31 It was to Ahab a trivial thing to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, so he took as his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians; he went and worshiped Baal and bowed down to him.
\v 32 He built an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
\v 33 Ahab made an Asherah pole. Ahab did even more to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of
Israel who had been before him.
