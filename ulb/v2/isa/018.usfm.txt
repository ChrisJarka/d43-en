\c 18
\p
\v 1 Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;
\v 2 that sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters,
saying, Go, you swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people terrible from their beginning onward, a
nation that meteth out and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide!
\v 3 All you inhabitants of the world, and you dwellers on the earth, when an ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see you; and
when the trumpet is blown, hear ye.
\p
\v 4 For thus has Jehovah said to me, I will be still, and I will behold in my dwelling-place, like clear heat in sunshine,
like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
\v 5 For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs
with pruning-hooks, and the spreading branches will he take away
and cut down.
\v 6 They shall be left together to the ravenous birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth; and the ravenous
birds shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
\v 7 In that time shall a present be brought to Jehovah of hosts
from a people tall and smooth, even from a people terrible from their beginning onward, a nation that meteth out and
treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of Jehovah of hosts, the mount Zion.
