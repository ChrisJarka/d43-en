\v 22 Because of \add what will happen to\add* them, all you people who have been taken from Judah to Babylon will say this when they curse someone: 'I hope\f + \ft Or: wish \f* that Yahweh will do to you the same thing that he did to Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon caused to be \add killed by being\add* burned in a fire.'
\v 23 They have done terrible things to my Israelite people. They have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and they have spoken lies, saying that they were messages \f + \ft metonymy \f* from me. They have said things that I did not tell them to say, and I, Yahweh, have heard them \add say those things\add*."

\v 22 Then a curse will be spoken about these persons by all the captives of Judah in Babylon. The curse will say: May Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in fire.
\v 23 This will happen because of the shameful things they did in Israel when they committed adultery with their neighbor's wives and declared false words in my name, things that I never commanded them to say.
For I am the one who knows; I am the witnessâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **a curse will be spoken about these persons by all the captives of Judah in Babylon** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the captives of Judah in Babylon will say a curse about these persons" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **roasted** - This word usually refers to cooking food over an open fire or in a pan, not to burning completely. Possible meanings are 1) this is a euphemism. AT: "burned to death" or 2) the king's men attached them to poles over the fire close enough that the fire would slowly kill them but far enough away that it would not totally consume their bodies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **I am the one who knows; I am the witness** - These two clauses mean the same thing, and Yahweh repeats them for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
