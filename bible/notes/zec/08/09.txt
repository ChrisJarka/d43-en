\v 9 "Thus says Yahweh of hosts, 'Strengthen your hands, you who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the
prophets who laid the foundation for the house of Yahweh of hosts, to build the temple.
\v 10 For before those days there was no wage for any man, neither was there a wage for a beast. Whether going out or entering in, there was no peace from. I had cast out
every person, each was set against his neighbor.
