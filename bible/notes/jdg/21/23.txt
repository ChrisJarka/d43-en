\v 23 The people of Benjamin did so; they took the number of wives that they needed from the girls who danced, and they carried them off. They went and returned to their inheritance, rebuilt their cities, and lived in them.
\v 24 The people of Israel departed from there at that time, each man to his own tribe and family; each of them went back from there to his own inheritance.
