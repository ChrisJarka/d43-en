===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (UDB) **The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels -**  (This fits better at the beginning rather than in the middle of the verse.)
  * (UDB)** says to the priests, -**  "says to the priests that despise my name:"
  * **A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master:-**  "'A son honors his father, and a servant honors his master."
  * **if then I am a father, where is mine honor ****and if I am a master, where is my fear?' ****-**  "If I am your father and I am your master, where is the honor that I deserve?'".
  * **And you say, 'Wherein have we despised your name?' - **"You ask, 'How have we depised your name?'" (Rhetorical Question?)
  * **You offer polluted bread upon mine altar. -**  "You offer defiled (or 'unacceptable') sacrifices on my altar."
  * And you say, 'Wherein have we polluted thee?' - "Then you ask, 'How have we defiled your name?'" (Rhetorical Question
  * In that you say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible. - " You defile the altar by having no respect for the altar and offering unacceptible sacrifices." (This may be a Synecdoche in that the altar here does not mean the physical structure but the process of sacrifice and worship.)
