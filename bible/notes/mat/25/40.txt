\v 40 And the King will answer and say to them, "Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it to one of my brothers,
even the least of these, you did it to me."
\v 41 Then he will say to those on his left hand, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for
the devil and his angels:
\v 42 because I was hungry and you did not give me food; I was thirsty, and you did not give me drink;
\v 43 I was a stranger and you did not take me in; naked and you did not clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me."
