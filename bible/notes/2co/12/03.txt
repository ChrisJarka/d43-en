\v 3 And I know such a man--whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know; God knows--
\v 4 was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not permissable for a man to speak.
\v 5 On behalf of such a person I will boast; but I will not boast for myself, except in my weakness.
