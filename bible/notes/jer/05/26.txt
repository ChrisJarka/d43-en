<usfm>
\v 26 For among my people are found wicked men: they watch, as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch men.
\v 27 As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxed rich.
\v 28 They are waxed fat, they shine: yea, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they plead not the cause, the cause of the
fatherless, that they may prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
\v 29 Shall I not visit for these things? says Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
