====== deacon ======

===== Definition: =====

A deacon is a person who ministers to fellow believers in the area of practical needs, such as managing money and taking care of the needy.

  * The word "deacon" is taken directly from a Greek word meaning "servant" or "minister".
  * From the time of the early Christians, being a deacon has been a well-defined role and ministry in the Church body.
  * For example, in the New Testament, deacons would make sure that whatever money or food that the believers shared would be distributed fairly to the widows among them.
