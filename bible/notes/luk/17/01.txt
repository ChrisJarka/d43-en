\v 1 And he said to his disciples, "It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe to him, through whom they come!
\v 2 It were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he  should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
