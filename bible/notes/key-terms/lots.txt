====== casting lots ======

===== Definition: =====

A "lot" is a marked object that is thrown or picked from among other similar objects as an unbiased way of making a choice or decision. God's people used it as a way of finding out what God wanted them to do.

  * One example of drawing lots is when a straw is selected from a group of straws of unknown but different lengths; the person who selects the shortest (or longest) straw is the winner (or loser).
  * Another type of lot may have been marked stones or pottery that were tossed or rolled onto the ground. The person who rolled the specially marked piece would be chosen.
  * The phrase "casting lots" can be translated as "tossing lots" or "drawing lots" or "rolling lots". Make sure it doesn't sound like they were thrown a long way.
