\v 41 Later he said to them, "I will show you that people are wrong who say that the Messiah is merely a descendant of King David!
\v 42 Because David himself wrote in the book of Psalms about the Messiah,
\q God said to my Lord,
\q Sit here beside me on my right, where I will highly honor you.
\v 43 Sit here while I completely defeat your enemies.
\p
\v 44 King David calls the Messiah 'my Lord'! So the Messiah cannot be just someone descended from King David! What I just said proves that he is much greater than David, isn't that right?"

\v 41 And he said to them, "How say they that the Christ is Davidâ€™s son?
\v 42 For David himself says in the book of Psalms, 
\q The Lord said to my Lord,
\q Sit on my right hand,
\q
\v 43 Till I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.
\m
\v 44 David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?"
