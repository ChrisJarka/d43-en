While these titles often describe the author or audience of the biblical book, “Ruth” is a reference to the book's main character. Many title choose to summarize the contents of the book. It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or to follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]).

Ruth lived during the time when there were judges in Israel.  It is therefore concurrent with the book of Judges, but it was not recorded until after the time of King David.

**What type of writing is Ruth?**\\
This book does not place great importance on its historical aspects. Instead, it is written as a short novel or story. It has many dramatic parts and is structured similar to a play. The translator should attempt to keep the narrative quality of the book intact.

**Why does Scripture include a book about a woman from Moab, one of Israel's enemies?**\\
In a period when Israel is continually [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful|unfaithful]] to Yahweh, he finds a woman from Moab who displays great faith in Him. Their lack of faith in Yahweh is contrasted with the faith of one their enemies. While it is an Israelite, Boaz, who redeems Ruth, the Messiah is one of Ruth's descendants who will redeem Israel.

**What is a kinsman redeemer?**\\
As part of the Law of Moses, it was customary for a male relative to provide for a relative in need. In ancient Israel, it was a custom for the closest male relative to provide for a related widow by marrying her. This was due to the fact that women did not normally inherit any land or property. If the closest relative did not want to marry the woman, another relative could.

In Ruth, the provide a framework with which to understand the actions of Boaz, Ruth and Naomi which distinguish them from Israel as a whole.
