\v 22 And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that hears the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness
of riches, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
\v 23 And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that hears the word, and understands it; who verily bears
fruit, and brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
