===== Translation Notes: =====

While talking to his disciples, Jesus had just given two other illustrations about how important it is not to cause simple people or children not to believe.

  * **your foot causes you to stumble** - Here the writer talks about “the foot” as if it were a person who could cause one to stumble. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **and be thrown into hell** - "and God throws him into hell" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
