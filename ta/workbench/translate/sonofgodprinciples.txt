=== "Father" and "Son" are names which God calls himself in his word, the Bible. ===

The Bible shows that God called Jesus his Son.
>After he was baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water, and... a voice came out of the heavens saying, "__This is my beloved Son__. I am very pleased with him." (Matthew 3:16-17 ULB)
The Bible shows that Jesus called God his Father.
>Jesus said, "I praise you __Father__, Lord of heaven and earth,... no one knows the __Son__ except the __Father__, and no one knows the __Father__ except the __Son__" (Matthew 11:25-27 ULB) (See also: John 6:26-57 ULB)
Theologians have found the terms "Father" and "Son" to be irreplaceable, because any other terms end up suggesting incorrect things about God. No one should try to replace them in translation.

=== Father and Son eternally and intimately love each other. === 
>Jesus said, "Father, glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you... I glorified you on the earth,... Now Father, glorify me... with the glory that __I had with you before the world was created__." (John 17:1-5 ULB)

>The Father __loves__ the Son. (John 3:35-36; 5:19-20 ULB)

>no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son. (Luke 10:22 ULB)
Father, Son, and Spirit have eternally loved one another. They forever existed together in glory before creation. The Father has always been the Father, and the Son has always been the Son.   

=== Father and Son created humanity in their image to love as God loves. === 
>God said, "Let __us__ make man... after __our__ likeness..." God created man in his own image. (Genesis 1:26 ULB)

>"no one knows the __Son__ except the __Father__, and no one knows the __Father__ except the __Son__" (Matthew 11:27 ULB)

>Jesus said, "This is my commandment, that you should love one another as I have loved you." (John 15:12 ULB)

The Father and Son created human fathers and to know and love each other. God has chosen to reveal himself through normal family relationships. We cannot fully understand the depths of the relationship between God the Father and God the Son, but by translating with words that best represent the relationship between human fathers and sons, God speaks in the way he has chosen.

=== Human fathers and sons are fallen and imperfect, but God still desires them to be like him. === 

>the wickedness of mankind was great... the thoughts of their hearts was only evil (Genesis 6:5 ULB)

>[all are] under sin, as it is written, "There is none righteous, not one. There is none who understands. There is none who seeks after God. They have all turned away, they together have become useless. There is none who does good, ... all have sinned and come short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:9-23 ULB)

>God deals with you as with sons... Should we not... obey the Father of spirits and live? (Hebrews 12:7-9 ULB)

Normal human father-son relationships during Bible times were never as loving or perfect as between Jesus and his Father. But, the translator should not shy away from these God-selected terms because man is sinful. The words "Father" and "Son" allow God to speak to us and correct and guide our understanding of who God has always been. The Bible uses common, normal words for "Father" and "Son," like the English "father" and "son." Choose words in your language that are widely used and refer to a human "father" and "son." 

=== The eternal Son of God humbled himself 2000 years ago and was miraculously born of Mary. === 

God the Son came to earth as the "son of the Most High." The the Holy Spirit supernaturally placed him in Mary's womb, introducing his mission on earth to be born as a human and provide salvation for humanity.

>Then Mary said, "How will this happen, since I am a virgin?" The angel answered her, "The __Holy Spirit__ will come over you and the power of the __Most High__ will overshadow you. Therefore, the holy one who will be __born__ will be called the __Son of God__." (Luke 1:34-35 ULB)

>__Christ Jesus__... did not consider his __equality with God__ as something to hold on to. But instead he emptied himself... in the likeness of men he __humbled__ himself... to the death of the __cross__. (Philippians 2:5-8 ULB)\\  

=== God the Father adopts those who believe in his Son as his own children. ===
>God sent his Son... that we might receive __adoption as sons__. Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls, "Abba, Father." (Galatians 4:4-6 ULB)

>God so loved the world, he gave __his only unique Son__, that whoever __believes__ in him should not perish but have everlasting life. God did not send the __Son__... to condemn the world, but so that the world should be saved... He who __believes__ in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been condemned already because he has not believed __in the name of the unique Son of God__." (John 3:16-18 ULB)

>we were reconciled to God through the __death__ of his Son,... __saved__ by his __life__. (Romans 5:10 ULB) 

=== The terms "Father" and "Son" cannot be replaced by any other terms without suggesting incorrect things about God. No one should try to replace them in translation. ===

Jesus is called "the Son of God" and "the Son" many, many times in the New Testament, and God is called "the Father" many, many times in the New Testament. Jesus' statement in Matthew 28 names God's three Persons and is the way Jesus' followers have known God since the time of Jesus himself:

> Baptize them into __the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit__. (Matthew 28:19 ULB)

If words that mean something other than "father" and "son" are used to translate these words, then God's words about who God is have not been provided to readers. God is eternally Father, Son, and Spirit, and these words identify the God of the Bible, the one true God.

Therefore, it is necessary to chose the same terms for God "the Father" and "Son" that are revealed to humanity in God's word, the Bible. God himself is the source of these words, not man. These terms must be translated literally, which means the translator must use words in his language to translate Father and Son that are widely used and refer to a human "father" and his human "son." 
==== Translation Strategies ====

1. Think through all the possibilities that your language has to translate the words "son" and "father." Determine what word for each Person fits the meaning best in the context of God's Persons of "Son" and "Father."

2. If your language has more than one word for "son," use the word that has the closest meaning to "only son" (or "first son" if necessary).

3. If your language has more than one word for "father," use the word that has the closest meaning to "birth father," rather than "adoptive father."
