====== Luke 10 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament, poems or special prayers. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 11:2-4, which is a special prayer, commonly called the "Lord's Prayer." This prayer in Matthew 6 also has the phrase, "but deliver us from the evil one."

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
