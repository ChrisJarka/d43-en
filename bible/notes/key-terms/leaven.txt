====== leaven ======

===== Definition: =====

Leaven is a substance, like yeast, used in the process of making bread to fill the dough with gas bubbles, that is, to make dough rise.

  * Once the leaven is added to the dough, the baker must allow time for the dough to rise.
  * Metaphorically, leaven is like sin because sin spreads through a person's life in the same way leaven spreads throughout dough.
  * The tenth and final plague in the book of Exodus was the passover, and the tribes of Israel were commanded to make bread in haste without leaven because time would not be needed for the dough to rise.
  * The Passover is remembered annually by Jewish people by baking bread without leaven to remind them that they left Egypt in haste.
