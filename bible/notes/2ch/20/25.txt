\v 25 So Jehoshaphat and his soldiers went to take the possessions of their enemies, and they saw that there was a lot of equipment and clothing and other valuable things; there was more than they could carry away. There were very many things, with the result that it took three days for them to collect it all.
\v 26 The following day they gathered in Beracah Valley and praised Yahweh there. That is why that valley is still called Beracah, \add which means praise\add*.

\v 25 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and
dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three
days in taking the spoil, it was so much.
\v 26 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Jehovah: therefore the
name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day.
