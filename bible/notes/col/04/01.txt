===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul ends this section with instructions to masters. Then continues to give instructions to believers on how to live and speak.

  * **give to your servants** - The word "your" refers to Colossian believers who are slave owners.
  * **right and fair** - This is an expression for owners to do what is right and what is fair toward their slaves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **master in heaven** - God is their master, implying that 1) God will treat slave owners as they treated their earthy slaves or 2) As you treat your earthy slaves, God, your master, will treat you the same way.
