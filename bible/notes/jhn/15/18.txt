\v 18 "The people who are opposed to God will hate you. When that happens, remember that they hated me first.
\v 19 If you belonged to those who are opposed to God \f + \ft metonymy \f*, they would love \add you like they love\add* those who belong to them. But you do not belong to those who are opposed to God \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Instead, I chose you so that you would separate yourselves from \f + \ft metonymy \f* them. That is why those who are opposed to God \f + \ft metonymy \f* hate you.

\v 18 "If the world despises you, know that it hated me first.
\v 19 If you were of the world, the world would love you, and you would love what it loves and do what it does. But you do not belong to the world, but I chose you to come out of the world, and that is the reason the world despises you.

it hated you.
\v 19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own: but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the
