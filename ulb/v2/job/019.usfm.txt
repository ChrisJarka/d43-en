\c 19
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said,
\q
\v 2 How long will you vex my soul,
\q And break me in pieces with words?
\q
\v 3 These ten times have you reproached me:
\q You are not ashamed that you deal hardly with me.
\q
\v 4 And be it indeed that I have erred,
\q Mine error remains with myself.
\q
\v 5 If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me,
\q And plead against me my reproach;
\q
\v 6 Know now that God has subverted me in my cause,
\q And has compassed me with his net.
\b
\q
\v 7 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:
\q I cry for help, but there is no justice.
\q
\v 8 He has walled up my way that I cannot pass,
\q And has set darkness in my paths.
\q
\v 9 He has stripped me of my glory,
\q And taken the crown from my head.
\q
\v 10 He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone;
\q And my hope has he plucked up like a tree.
\q
\v 11 He has also kindled his wrath against me,
\q And he counts me to him as one of his adversaries.
\q
\v 12 His troops come on together,
\q And cast up their way against me,
\q And encamp round about my tent.
\b
\q
\v 13 He has put my brethren far from me,
\q And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.
\q
\v 14 My kinsfolk have failed,
\q And my familiar friends have forgotten me.
\q
\v 15 They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger:
\q I am an alien in their sight.
\q
\v 16 I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer,
\q Though I entreat him with my mouth.
\q
\v 17 My breath is strange to my wife,
\q And my supplication to the children of mine own mother.
\q
\v 18 Even young children despise me;
\q If I arise, they speak against me.
\q
\v 19 All my familiar friends abhor me,
\q And they whom I loved are turned against me.
\q
\v 20 My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh,
\q And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
\q
\v 21 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O you my friends;
\q For the hand of God has touched me.
\q
\v 22 Why do you persecute me as God,
\q And are not satisfied with my flesh?
\b
\q
\v 23 Oh that my words were now written!
\q Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
\q
\v 24 That with an iron pen and lead
\q They were graven in the rock for ever!
\q
\v 25 But as for me I know that my Redeemer liveth,
\q And at last he will stand up upon the earth:
\q
\v 26 And after my skin, even this body, is destroyed,
\q Then without my flesh shall I see God;
\q
\v 27 Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side,
\q And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger.
\q My heart is consumed within me.
\q
\v 28 If you say, How we will persecute him!
\q And that the root of the matter is found in me;
\q
\v 29 Be you afraid of the sword:
\q For wrath brings the punishments of the sword,
\q That you may know there is a judgment.
