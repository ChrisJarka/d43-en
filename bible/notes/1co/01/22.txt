====== 1 Corinthians 01:22-23 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 The Jews want \add people to prove, by performing\add* miracles, \add that their message is true\add*. The non-Jews want to hear only messages consisting of talk that they consider to be very wise.
\v 23 As for us, we proclaim \add the message about what\add* Christ \add accomplished for us when\add* he was nailed \f + \ft Or:\add when they\add* nailed him \f* to the cross. That message offends Jews \add because they do not think that the Messiah will die, and\add* non-Jews think it is \f + \ft irony \f* a foolish message.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 The Jews wanted public displays of miraculous power before they follow anyone. The Greeks are slaves to their philosphies and high-sounding speculations.
\v 23 But we proclaim the message -- a message in a person: Christ who was crucified. For the Jews a cause of stumbling and offensive to their law. To the Greeks not sophisticated enough and too simple to be true.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 However,  Jews ask for miraculous signs and the Greeks seek wisdom.
\v 23 But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.
