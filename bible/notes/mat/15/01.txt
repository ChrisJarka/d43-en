===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins an encounter between Jesus and the religious leaders.

  * **violate the tradition of the elders** - "do not respect the rules given by the older religious leaders."
  * **wash their hands**- "they do not wash as required." This is not referring only to washing for eating. The Jewish tradition required washing often and in specific ways. 
  * **Jesus answered and said to them** - "Jesus answered and said to the Pharisees and scribes"
  * **And you–why do you** - The word "you" refers to the Pharisees and scribes.
  * **why do you violate the commandment of God** - Jesus is using a rhetorical question to point out their disobedience. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **for the sake of your traditions** - "to follow what has been passed down to you." Their traditions have become more important than obeying God's word.
