===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:en:obe:other:israel|Israel]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **went out to**  - "approached"
  * **when they heard it**  - "as soon as they heard."
  * **he had disgraced Israel**  - "he had committed an outrageous act in Israel" or "he had committed an act of wickedness in Israel."
  * **he had disgraced Israel by forcing himself on Jacob’s daughter** - The author wants us to understand that "Israel" is more than just Jacob under another name. So in the same breath, the same sentence, the author identifies Jacob as the father of the girl. "Israel" then is something else. It is every member of his family, servants, the entire clan, the entire people-group that is disgraced. Israel as a people is disgraced. 
  * **should not have been done **- "should not be done."
  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **bold words**  - explanation
