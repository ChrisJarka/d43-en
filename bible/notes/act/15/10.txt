\v 10 You are wanting to force the non-Jewish believers to obey our Jewish rituals and laws—laws that God has shown that he does not require them to obey. Your doing that is like putting a heavy burden on their necks! So then, stop making God angry by doing that! Our ancestors and we Jews have never been able to bear the burden of obeying those laws!
\v 11 But we know that it is not because we try to obey those laws that God saves us Jews. On the contrary, we know that it is because of what the Lord Jesus did for us that we did not deserve that we are saved from the guilt of our sins. God saves us Jews exactly like he saves those non-Jews who believe in the Lord Jesus."
