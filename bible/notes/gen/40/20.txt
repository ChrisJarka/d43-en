On that day the king invited all his officials to celebrate his birthday. During the celebration, while they were all gathered there, the king summoned his chief drink-server and chief baker from the prison.
\v 21 He said that his chief drink-server could have his previous job again, so that again he took cups of wine to the king.
\v 22 But he commanded that the chief baker should be killed by being hanged, just as Joseph had said would happen when he told the two men the meaning of their dreams.

\v 23 But the chief drink-server did not think about Joseph. He forgot to do what Joseph asked him to do.

\v 20 It came about on the third day that it was Pharaoh's birthday. He made a feast for all his servants. He paid special attention to the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, more than to all his other servants.
\v 21 He restored the chief cupbearer to his responsibility, and he put the cup into Pharaoh's hand again.
\v 22 But he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.
\v 23 Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember to help Joseph. Instead, he forgot about him.
