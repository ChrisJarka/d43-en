===== Description =====

Some languages have more than one form of “we”: an **inclusive** form that means "I and you" and and **exclusive** form that means "I and someone else but not you."  Another way of saying this is that the exclusive "we" refers only to the speaker and at least one other person but not the person being spoken to. It excludes the person being spoken to.

See the pictures. The people on the right are the people that the speaker is talking to. The yellow highlight shows who the inclusive "we" and the exclusive "we" refer to.

**Reason this is a translation issue** - The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. Like English, these languages do not have separate exclusive pronouns. Translators whose language has separate exclusive pronouns will always need to be careful whenever they read words “we” “us” and “ours” in English, Hebrew, or Greek. They will need to know whether they should use the pronoun that includes the person being spoken to or the pronoun that excludes the person being spoken to. 
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Forgive __us__ __our__ sins** (Luke 11:4) \\ 
God has no sins to forgive; so languages that have exclusive forms of “we” and “us” would use the exclusive forms in this verse.

**__we__ have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us** (1 John 1:2) \\ 
John is telling people who have not seen Jesus what he and the other apostles have seen. So languages that have exclusive forms of “we” and “us” would use the exclusive forms in this verse.
