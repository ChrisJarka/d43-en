=== What is the Book of Philippians about? ===

The Book of Philippians is a letter that the Apostle Paul wrote to the Christians in the area of Philippi, a city in Macedonia. The Philippians had sent Epaphroditus, one of their beloved church members, to help Paul in Rome and bring Paul a gift from the Philippian church. Epaphroditus planned to stay in Rome with Paul and help him while he was in prison, but he became very ill. The Philippians had written Paul to ask about Epaphroditus; the Book of Philippians may have been Paul's reply. 

This also gave Paul the opportunity to write the Philippian church a letter about matters of importance to the apostle, and to send it to them by means of Epaphroditus, their beloved friend, as he returned home to Philippi.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
=== What is "christlikeness"? ===

Many scholars have described the instructions that Paul gives, especially in the Book of Philippians, as a command to pursue Christlikeness. Although this word is not in Scripture, it is a biblical concept. Christians are to view Christ's perfect life as a model to follow. True [[:en:obe:kt:holy|holiness]] "like Christ" in our character. It may be useful for translators to have a similar word or concept in their language.

=== What was the city of Philippi like?===

Philippi was founded by Philip, who was the father of Alexander the Great. The city was given honor and special privileges of citizenship within the Roman Empire. This is why citizenship play an important role in Paul's teaching to the church there. Christians are said to be "citizens of heaven."

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Who does Paul address as the "enemies of the cross" in this letter? ===

The identity of this opposition is uncertain. Many options have been suggested but it appears from verse 19 that they were probably people who taught that having freedom in Christ meant that one could live however they desire to as Christians without consequences.

=== Why are the words "joy" and "rejoice" frequently used in this letter? ===

Paul is in prison when he writes this letter. People in prison are not typically happy about their conditions because prison is supposed to be a type of punishment. Despite his difficulties, Paul repeated explains that he is joyous and has reasons for rejoicing because of the grace of God shown through Jesus. These words are intended to convey shock about Paul's attitude and emotions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Philippians? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of manuscripts that many believe are more accurate. The follow are the most significant issues in the Book of Philippians:

  * "rule, let us be of the same mind." (3:16) 

Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to the Book of Philippians.
