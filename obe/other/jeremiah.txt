===== Facts: =====

Jeremiah was a prophet of God in the kingdom of Judah. The Old Testament book of Jeremiah contains his prophecies.

  * Like most of the prophets, Jeremiah often had to warn the people of Israel that God was going to punish them for their sins.
  * Jeremiah prophesied that the Babylonians would capture Jerusalem, which made some of the people of Judah angry. So they put him in a deep, dry well and left him there to die. But the king of Judah ordered his servants to rescue Jeremiah from the well.
  * Jeremiah is known for his deep sadness over the sufferings of the Israelite people.
