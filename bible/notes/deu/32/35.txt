===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: Parallelism)

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 34-35, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **Vengeance is mine to give, and recompense - **  AT: "To me belong vengeance and recompense. " This means that Yahweh would certanly avenge them.
  * **At the time when their foot slips - ** AT: "In due time their feet will slip" This means that they would eventualy fail. The image of the foot sliping represents their fall. (See: Synecdoche)
  * **And the things that are to come on them will hurry to happen. **- AT: "And their doom is coming quickly."
