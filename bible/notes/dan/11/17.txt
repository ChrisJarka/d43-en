\v 17 And the king of the north was determined to come with the strength of his entire kingdom, and with him a fair agreement that he would put into effect with the king of the south. He would give the king of the south a daughter in marriage to destroy the kingdom of the south. But the plan did not succeed or help him. 
\v 18 After this shall the king of the north will give attention to the coastlands, and capture many of them. But a commander will put an end to his insolence, and cause his insolence to turn back upon him. 
\v 19 Then he will give attention to the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall, and will not be found.
