===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **feast of unleavened bread** - The feast was called by this name because during the feast, the Jews did not eat bread that was made with yeast. "Unleavened" means "without yeast."
  * **drew near** - "was almost ready to begin"
  * **Afraid of the people **- This can be translated as "scared of what the people might do." They were afraid that the people might riot, which would cause the Romans to punish the Jews in order to restore order.
