\v 5 I insist that murderers must be executed. Animals that kill people must also be executed. The reason that everyone who murders someone else must be executed is that
\v 6 I made people to be like myself \add in many ways\add*. So someone who murders another human being must be executed by others, \add because he killed someone who is like me\add*.
\p
\v 7 As for you, I want you to produce many children, in order that they and their descendants may live all over the earth."

\v 5 But for your blood, the blood that is your life, I will require payment. From every animal I will require it. From the hand of man, that is, from the hand of a man’s brother, I will require payment for the life of a man.
\v 6 Whoever sheds man’s blood, by man will his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.
\v 7 As for you, be fruitful and multiply, spread throughout the earth and multiply on it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues speaking to Noah and his sons.

  * **But for your blood, the blood that is your life**  - The blood represents life. This could also be translated as “If anyone spills your blood, if anyone kills you.”
  * **I will require payment**  - “I will require anyone who kills you to pay” or “I will punish anyone who kills you”
  * **from every animal, I will require it**  - “I will require any animal that takes your life to pay” or "I will require any animal that kills you to pay."
  * **from the hand of man… I will require payment for the life of a man**  - This can be translated as "I will require anyone who takes a person's life to pay with his own life."
  * **brother**  - "fellow man"
  * **whoever sheds man's blood, by man will his blood be shed**  - This can be translated as "If anyone sheds a man's blood, someone must shed that man's blood." This means that if a person murders someone, someone else must kill the murderer.
  * **for God made man in his own image**  - "because God made people to be like him." Since God was speaking, this can also be translated as "because I made people in my own image."
  * **be fruitful and multiply**  - See how you translated these commands in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:28|1:28]].
