===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **And he â€¦ to them**  - that is, Jesus spoke this parable to the Pharisees and scribes
    * **spoke this parable to them, saying**  - or, "by saying", or "he told them a parable, and said"
    * **which one of you . . will not leave the ninety nine . . and go after . . until he finds it? **- The expected answer to this question is yes. A shepherd will leave the ninety nine sheep and look for the one missing sheep. This is as if Jesus was saying, "none of you if you have one hundred sheep and lost one will just stay with the ninety nine and not try to find the missing one." 
    * **then loses one of them**- The word here for "lose" means that the thing which is "lost" has been "destroyed" or has "perished." In this case, it just means that the shepherd had 100 and was down by one without explanation. The shepherd doesn't know if the sheep is alive or dead, but goes looking for it expecting it to be dead, and instead finds it alive.
    * **will not leave**- That is, "will not leave behind," or "will not go away from."
    * **go after the lost one**- That is ,"look for the lost sheep from one place to another place."
    * **lay it across his shoulders**- That is "put the sheep around his shoulders" or "carried the sheep across his shoulders." 
    * **and rejoices **- That is, "while rejoicing," or "rejoices while the sheep is on his shoulders."
