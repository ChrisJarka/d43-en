====== Euphemism [ˈyo͞ofəˌmizəm] ======

A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant or embarrassing. Its purpose is to avoid offending the people who hear or read it.

===== Examples from English =====

**Adult beverages** \\
refers to “beer or liquor.”

**He passed away** and **He departed** \\
mean “He died.”

**He slept with her** \\
usually means “They had sexual relations with each other.”

**Bathroom** and **restroom** \\
refer to a room that has a toilet in it.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**When a woman in the city who was __a sinner__, learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.** Luke 7:37\\
Since all people are sinners, the word __sinner__ here did not mean simply that this woman was a sinner, but that she was notably immoral. Luke may have used the word "sinner" as a euphemism for "a prostitute".

**He came to the sheep pens by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to __cover his feet__.** 1 Samuel 24:3\\
"Cover his feet" is a euphemism for "defecate." English uses the euphemism "relieve himself." Sometimes people don't like to speak directly of things coming from the body.

**But we don’t want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have __fallen asleep__, so that you don’t grieve like the rest, who have no hope.** 1 Thes 4:13 (WEB)\\
"Fallen asleep" is a euphemism for "died." Sometimes people don't like to speak directly about death because it is unpleasant.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Use the euphemism that is used in the original if people would understand it.
  * Use a euphemism from your own culture.
  * State the information plainly without a euphemism if it would not be offensive.
