\v 17 The seventy people whom Jesus appointed went and did as he told them to. When they returned, they were very joyful. They said, "Lord, even the demons obeyed us when by your authority we commanded them to leave people!"
\v 18 He replied, "While you were away doing that, I saw Satan fall from heaven as suddenly and quickly as lightning strikes!
\v 19 Listen! I have given you the right to attack evil spirits. They will not hurt you. I have given you the right to be stronger than our enemy, Satan. Nothing will hurt you at all.
\v 20 But as you rejoice that evil spirits obey you, you should rejoice even more that your names have been written in heaven."

\v 17 The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons submitted to us in your name."
\v 18 Jesus said to them, "I was watching Satan fall from heaven as lightning.
\v 19 Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents, and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing will in any way hurt you.
\v 20 Nevertheless do not rejoice only in this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice even more that your names are engraved in heaven."
