===== Translation Notes: =====

Bildad continues his answer to Job by further comparing godless people to plants. Godless people seam like plants. (See: Metaphore).

  * **under the sun he is green **- In the day time, the godless person looks alive, fresh and healthy.
  * **he **- "the godless person"
  * **green **- "fresh", "healthy", "alive". This is the color of plants and grass.
  * **shoots**  - This is a plant during its early stages of growth. It shows that a plant is healthy and will continue to grow.
  * **his roots are wrapped about the heaps of stone**  - Instead of fertile soil, the godless person's roots cling to nothing but rocks. Rocky ground cannot help plans grow. This person's roots will soon die. AT: "his roots cling to rocky ground".
  * **stone**  - AT: "rocks".
  * **they look for good places among the rocks **- This phrase expresses a similar idea to "his roots are wrapped about the heaps of stone". (See: Parallelism)
  * **they**  - this pronoun refers to the godless person's roots. AT: "his roots"
  * **good places**  - AT: "fertile ground," or "soil good for growith plants".
  * **if this person is destroyed out of his place, then that place will deny him **- This is a conditional clause. The "if" introduces the problem. The "then" describes the result.
  * **if this person is destroyed out of his place **- AT: "if the plant dies," or "if the person dies".
  * **his place **- AT: "the rocky ground".
  * **deny him**  - AT: "deceive him," or "lie to him". What the godless person has trusted in will betray him.
  * **"I never saw you"**  - There will be no memory of the godless person on the earth after he dies.
