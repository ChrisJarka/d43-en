<usfm>
\v 14 Issachar, your descendants will be like strong donkeys
\q that are lying down on the ground between their loads,
\q so tired that they cannot get up!
\q
\v 15 They will see that their resting place is good,
\q and that the land pleases them very much.
\q But they will bend their backs to carry heavy loads
\q and be forced to work for others.
