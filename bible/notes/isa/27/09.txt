===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **So in this way, the iniquity of Jacob will be atoned for**- "this way" is referring "the measure" in the previous verse.- reason for Yahweh punishing Israel. By this - This verse states the whole design of the punishment of the Jews. They were taken away from their temple, their city, and their land; they were removed from the groves and altars of idolatry by which they had been so often led into sin; and the design was to preserve them henceforward from relapsing into their accustomed idolatry.
  * **for this will be the full fruit of turning away from his sin**- so that Irsael an come to true repentance.
  * **bold words**  - No more idols. When he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalk stones - That is, Yahweh shall make the stones of the altars reared in honor of idols like chalk stones; or shall throw them down, and scatter them abroad like stones that are easily beaten to pieces. The sense is, that Yahweh, during their captivity in Babylon, would overthrow the places where they had worshipped idols.
  * **bold words**  - They will never again bow down to their Asherah poles or worship at the pagan shrines they have built. See 17:8
