\v 15 If you buy land, the price that you will pay will depend on the number of years there will be until the next Year of Celebration. If someone sells land to you, he will charge a price that is determined by the number of years until the next Year of Celebration.
\v 16 If there will be many years before the next Year of Celebration, the price will be higher; if there will be only a few years until the next Year of Celebration, the price will be lower. \add You could say that\add* what he is really selling you is the number of crops \add which you can harvest before the next Year of Celebration\add*.
\v 17 Do not cheat each other; instead, revere me. I, Yahweh your God, \add am the one who am commanding this\add*.

\v 15 If you buy land from your neighbor, consider the number of years and crops that can be harvested until the next jubilee, and your neighbor selling the land is to consider that also. 
\v 16 The more years there are until the next jubilee will increase the value of land, and the smaller the number of years until the next jubilee will decrease the value, because the number of harvests the land will produce for the new owner is related to the number of years before the next jubilee (when the land is to be returned to the previous owner).
\v 17 You must not cheat or wrong one another, but you must fear your God,  for I am Yahweh your God.
