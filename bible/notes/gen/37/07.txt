===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:behold|Behold]] 

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **tying sheaves**  - "tying up bundles of grain stalks." They stood these bundled stalks up in the field to let them dry.
  * **your sheaves came around and bowed down to my sheaf" - "your grain bundles surrounded and bowed down to my grain bundle"
  * **Will you really reign over us? Will you actually rule over us?** - Each question is a [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]] that means "you cannot really rule over us." If your language uses rhetorical questions for this meaning, use them here.
  * **for his dreams and for his words**  - "because of his dreams and his words"
