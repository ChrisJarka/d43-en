\c 29
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Ascribe to Jehovah, O you sons of the mighty,
\q Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength.
\q
\v 2 Ascribe to Jehovah the glory due to his name;
\q Worship Jehovah in holy array.
\b
\q
\v 3 The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters:
\q The God of glory thundereth,
\q Even Jehovah upon many waters.
\q
\v 4 The voice of Jehovah is powerful;
\q The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty.
\q
\v 5 The voice of Jehovah breaks the cedars;
\q Yea, Jehovah breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
\q
\v 6 He makes them also to skip like a calf;
\q Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox.
\q
\v 7 The voice of Jehovah clings the flames of fire.
\q
\v 8 The voice of Jehovah shaketh the wilderness;
\q Jehovah shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
\q
\v 9 The voice of Jehovah makes the hinds to calve,
\q And strippeth the forests bare:
\q And in his temple everything saith, Glory.
\b
\q
\v 10 Jehovah sat as King at the Flood;
\q Yea, Jehovah sits as King for ever.
\q
\v 11 Jehovah will give strength to his people;
\q Jehovah will bless his people with peace.
