===== Glossary =====
This page is a glossary of important terms for unfoldingWord translation projects.

==== Checking Level ====
A Checking Level refers to the three-level iterative checking scale that shows the extent to which the accuracy of a translation has been corroborated. The checking levels used on Door43 have been developed by unfoldingWord and are outlined in the [[http://distantshores.org/resources/whitepapers/quality-assurance|Quality Assurance Document]]. All three checking levels compare the translation to the source text, translation notes, Statement of Faith, and Translation Guidelines.

==== Checking Level 1 ==== 
The first checking level is an internal check made by the translator(s) who affirm that their work is an accurate translation of the source text, the translation notes were used in the translation process, the Statement of Faith is an accurate representation of their beliefs, and the translation process was in accordance with the Translation Guidelines.

==== Checking Level 2 ====
The second checking level is an external check made by three church leaders who come from church bodies  that are in agreement with the Statement of Faith and who are native speakers of the target language and at least one of whom understands well the source language. These three will thoroughly check the translation and affirm that translated work is an accurate translation of the source text and that the translation is in line with the Statement of Faith and the Translation Guidelines.

==== Checking Level 3 ====
The third checking level is an authenticated check with two possible tracks. In the first track, leaders of three church networks must sign off on the translation. In the second track, one leader of a church network and one trained translation checker must sign off on the translation. In both tracks, the translation is again thoroughly checked to make sure that translated work is an accurate translation of the source text and that the translation is in line with the Statement of Faith and the Translation Guidelines.
