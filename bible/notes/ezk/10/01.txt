\v 1 Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a
sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
\v 2 And he spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling
wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them
over the city. And he went in in my sight.
