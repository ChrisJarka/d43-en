===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Is it you, my master Elijah?** - Obadiah is using this question to express surprise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **master Elijah** - Here the word master is used as a term of respect. 
  * **Look**  - This word is used to draw attention to what he has to say.
  * **Go tell your master, 'Look, Elijah is here'"** - Obadiah worked for King Ahab, so it is implicit that Obadiah's master in this usage is King Ahab. AT: "Go tell Ahab that I am here." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations|Speech Quotations]])
