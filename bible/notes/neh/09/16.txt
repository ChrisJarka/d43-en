\v 16 But our ancestors were very proud and stubborn [IDI], and they did not obey what you commanded them to do.
\v 17 They refused to heed you, and they forgot about all the miracles that you had performed for them. Instead, they became stubborn [IDI], and they appointed someone to lead them back to Egypt, where they would be slaves again! But you are a God who forgives us and who acts kindly and mercifully \add toward us\add*. You do not quickly become angry. You are always faithfully loving us.

\v 16 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their neck, and listened not to your commandments,
\v 17 and refused to obey, neither were mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened their neck, and in
their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow
to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and forsookest them not.
