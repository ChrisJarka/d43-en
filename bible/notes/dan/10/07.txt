\v 7 I, Daniel, was the only one who saw this vision. The men who were with me did not see anything, but \add they sensed that someone was there, and they\add* became terrified. They ran away and hid themselves.
\v 8 So I was left there by myself, looking at this very unusual vision. I had no strength left. My face became very pale, with the result that no one would have recognized me.
\v 9 I saw a man there, and when I heard him speak, I fell to the ground. I fainted\f + \ft Or: became unconscious \f*, \add and I lay there\add* with my face on the ground.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them,
and they fled to hide themselves.
\v 8 So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me
into corruption, and I retained no strength.
\v 9 Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my
face, with my face toward the ground.
