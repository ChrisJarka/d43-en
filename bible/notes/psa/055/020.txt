\q1
\v 21 What he said was as easy to listen to as butter is easy to swallow,
\q2 but in his inner being he hated people;
\q1 his words were as soothing as olive oil,
\q2 but they hurt people as sharp swords do.

<usfm>
\q
\v 20 My friend has raised his hands against those who were at peace with him;
\q he has not respected the covenant that he had.
\q
\v 21 His mouth was smooth as butter,
\q but his heart was hostile;
\q his words were softer than oil,
\q yet they were actually drawn swords.
