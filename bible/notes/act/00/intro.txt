=== What is the Book of Acts about? ===

The book of Acts is the history of the church for about 30 years after Jesus’ went to heaven. It covers a period of evangelism and church planting in which the church greatly expanded. It is the history of the early church and an account of power of God, the Spirit of God, working in the early church. Acts is the account of faith and hardship, miracles and judgment.  As the Spirit guided and helped the early Christians, they began to fulfill the Great Commission of Matthew 28:19-20. This is an account of the early Christians’ experience of God with them, continuing Jesus’ ministry on earth.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Acts" or "The Acts of the Apostles." Some called this book, “The Acts of the Holy Spirit” because the coming of the Spirit of God into the lives of God’s people is the beginning of the church. Translators may choose a title that may be clearer, for example "The Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Acts? ===

The book does not give the reader the name of the author. Since early Christian times, however, it has been generally believed that the author was Luke because he is the only person who could be included in the passages using the word "we." Luke was a medical doctor and his way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile who was sympathetic to Judaism, but he was not a convert to Judaism. Although he was not an eyewitness to the ministry of Jesus, but as he wrote his accounts, he consulted many people who were.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
=== What is the [[:en:obe:kt:church|Church]]? ===

The book of Acts begins a new era in the religious history of mankind. God is no longer concerned with proper worship governed through the Temple in Jerusalem. He also shifts his focus in Acts from the nation Israel to the church. The church, also called the "body of Christ," consists of all those who believe in Christ. The remainder of the New Testament, after Acts, will now focus on righteous living in light of the death of Christ. 

=== Does the New Covenant begin in Acts? ===

Is this too controversial and complicated?

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Text-Question ===

Text-Answer

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Luke? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of more accurate manuscripts. The follow are the most significant issues in Luke:\\

  * "Then an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground." (22:43–44) 
  * "For he was required to release one prisoner during the feast" (23:17) (so noted in ULB)
  * "Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." (23:34)


Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to Luke's Gospel.
