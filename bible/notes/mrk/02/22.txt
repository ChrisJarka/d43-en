===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **No man puts new wine into old wineskins** - This is a metaphor meaning that new wine, which needs to fervent and expand, cannot be put into old skin bags. This will lead to ruining both the wine and the old skin bags, because the skin bags would not stretch. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
