\v 40 When he returned, he found that they were sleeping again because they were so sleepy that they could not keep their eyes open. Because they were ashamed, they did not know what to say to him when he awakened them.
\v 41 Then he went and prayed again. He returned a third time; and he found them sleeping again. He woke all of them and said to them, "I am disappointed that you are sleeping again! You have slept enough. The time for me to suffer is about to begin. Look! Someone is about to enable sinful men to seize me, the one who came from heaven.
\v 42 So get up! Let's go toward him! Look! Here comes the one who is enabling them to seize me!"

\v 40 Having returned, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy, and they did not know what to answer him.
\v 41 And he came the third time, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough, the hour has come; look, the son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\v 42 Get up, let us be going: look, the one who betrays me is nearby.
