\v 2 Many nations will go and say,
\q "Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
\q to the house of the God of Jacob.
\q He will teach us his ways,
\q and we will walk in his paths."
\q For from Zion the law will go out,
\q and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.
\q
\v 3 He will judge among many peoples
\q and will decide concerning numerous nations far away.
\q They will beat their swords into plowshares
\q and their spears into pruning hooks.
\q Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
\q nor will they train for war any longer.
