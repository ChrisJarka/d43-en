\v 17 We \add should\add* love others completely. And if we do that, when the time comes for \add him to\add* judge us, we will be confident \add that he will not condemn us\add* (OR\add , that we have a close relationship with him\add*). \add We will be confident of that\add* because of our \add conducting our lives\add* in this world as Christ did.
\v 18 We will not be afraid \add of God\add* if we \add truly\add* love \add him\add*, because those who love \add God\add* completely cannot possibly be afraid \add of him\add*. \add We would be\add* afraid only \add if we thought that he would\add* punish us. So those who are afraid \add of God certainly\add* are not loving \add God\add* completely.

\v 17 We should love others completely. And if we do that, when the time comes for God to judge us, we will be confident that he will not condemn us. We will be confident of that because we have lived in this world as Christ did.
\v 18 We will not be afraid of God if we truly love him, because those who love God completely cannot possibly be afraid of him. We would be afraid only if we thought that he would punish us. So those who are afraid of God certainly are not loving God completely.

\v 17 In this is love has been made perfect among us, that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because as he is, just so are we in this world.
\v 18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love throws out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love.
