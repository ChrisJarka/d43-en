====== Melchizedek ======
â€‹

===== Facts: =====

During the time when Abram lived, Melchizedek was the king of Salem (later, "Jerusalem").

  * Melchizedek's name means, "king of righteousness" and his title "king of Salem" means "king of peace."
  * He was also called a "priest of God Most High."
  * Melchizedek is first mentioned in the Bible when he served Abram bread and wine after Abram rescued his nephew Lot from some powerful kings.
  * Then Abram gave Melchizedek one-tenth of the plunder from his victory.
  * In the New Testament, Melchizedek is described as someone who had no father or mother. He was a priest and king who will reign forever. He is said to "resemble the Son of God."
  * Also in the New Testament, Jesus is called a priest who serves according to the priestly "order of Melchizedek." Melchizedek came before the priesthood of Levi. This may reflect that Jesus is our "Great High Priest" whose priesthood comes directly from God, not from human descent.
  * Based on these descriptions of him in the Bible, Melchizedek was a human priest who was also designed by God to represent or look forward to Jesus, the eternal King of Peace and Righteousness and our Great High Priest.
