\v 29 Wherefore kick you at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in
my habitation, and honorest your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of
Israel my people?
\v 30 Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk
before me for ever: but now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me
shall be lightly esteemed.
