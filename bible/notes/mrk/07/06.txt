===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He said, "Isaiah prophesied.. their doctrines"**  - Jesus quotes the Old Testament both to give the Pharisees an answer to their question but he also does a couple other things.  First he affirms the lesson that he taught in chapter 2, which said that God is over the Sabbath and that it was made to protect and serve man not the other way around.  Again, Jesus is saying that while the ceremonial rules are valuable they are not meant to strictly control peoples actions but rather are meant to be remind people of the reality of God and what is a good way to interact with Him.
  * **He said, "Isaiah prophesied.. their doctrines"- ** The other thing Jesus does by answer this question way is connect himself to Isaiah's prophecy implying that when Isaiah talks about the coming messiah that he was in fact talking about Jesus.
