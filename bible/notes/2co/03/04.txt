\v 4 I \add can very\add* confidently \add write these things about the work that Silas, Timothy, and I did among you, because God knows that what I write is true. We\f + \ft exclusive \f* are true workers\add* for God\add because of what\add* Christ \add has done for us\add*.
\v 5 We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, by ourselves, do not have the ability \add to do this work\add*. None of us \add apostles\add* can say, "\add I have changed the lives of these people\add*." God is the one \add who has given us this ability\add*.
\v 6 He is the one who enables us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* to be his messengers. \add He has enabled us to tell people the message\add* about the new agreement \add that he is making with them\add*. This is not a \add message about obeying all the\add* written laws \add of his old agreement that he made with the Jewish people\add*. Instead, \add it is a message about God giving us his\add* Spirit. \add Previously, God condemned people to be\add* separated from him forever \add if they did not obey his laws\add*. But by \add God's new agreement\add* his Spirit enables people to live \add eternally\add*.

\v 4 I can very confidently write these things about the work that Silas, Timothy, and I did among you, because God knows that what I write is true. We are true workers for God because of what Christ has done for us.
\v 5 We, by ourselves, do not have the ability to do this work. None of us apostles can say, "I have changed the lives of these people." God is the one who has given us this ability.
\v 6 He is the one who enables us to be his messengers. He has enabled us to tell people the message about the new agreement that he is making with them. This is not a message about obeying all the written laws of his old agreement that he made with the Jewish people. Instead, it is a message about God giving us his Spirit. Previously, God condemned people to be separated from him forever if they did not obey his laws. But by God's new agreement his Spirit enables people to live eternally.

\v 4 And this is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.
\v 5Not that we are worthy in ourselves, to consider anything as coming from us, but our worthiness is from God;
\v 6 who also made us worthy to be ministers of a new covenant, not of what is written, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
