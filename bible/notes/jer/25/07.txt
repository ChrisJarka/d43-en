\v 7 Yet you have not listened to me, says Jehovah; that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.
\v 8 Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts: Because you have not heard my words,
\v 9 behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, says Jehovah, and I will send to Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
