===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 9 Formerly, when I did not \add know\add* what God's laws \add required\add*, I used to live \add without worrying about what I was doing\add*. But when I \add became aware that God\add* commanded, \add "You must not covet\add*," I suddenly realized \f + \ft personification \f* that I was sinning, \v 10 and \add I realized that\add* I was separated from God. The laws that \add I thought would enable me to\add* live \add eternally as a result of my obeying them\add* caused me \add to realize that\add* I was separated from God! </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 9 Formerly, when I did not know what God's Law required, I used to sin without worrying about what I was doing. But when I became aware that God had given us his Law, I suddenly realized that I was sinning, \v 10 and I realized that I was apart from God. The Law that was supposed to allow me to live forever, if I obeyed it, was leading me to die instead. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 9 I was alive without the Law once, but when the commandment came, sin regained life and I died. \v 10 The commandment, which was to bring life, I found to be to death. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I was alive without the Law once**  - Before the law came there was not a way of conviction or knowing what was regarded as sin. This is unpleasant and shameful to admit. This can be translated as: "Before I knew what God required I did whatever I wanted to and did not think of it as sin." (See: Euphemism)
  * **but when the commandment came**  - The commandment is the Law of God that was given so that sin could be recognized.Before the commandment or Law there was no way to know the difference between right and wrong.
  * **sin regained life and I died** - Here a comparison of  the Law and how life indicates presence or obedience to God and death represents the opposite or separation from God. The Law that was suppose to allow me to live forever, if I obeyed it, was leading me to die instead.(UDB) (See:[[en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]] and [[en:ta:translate:personification|Personification]])
