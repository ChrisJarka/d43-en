\v 10 As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God's many graces.
\v 11 If someone speaks, let him speak as a spokesman of God; and if someone serves, let him serve out of the strength that God supplies, so that in all things, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. Glory and power belong to him for ever and ever. Amen.
