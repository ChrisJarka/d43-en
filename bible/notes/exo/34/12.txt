===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.
  * **they will become a trap among you**  - This emphasizes that they will cause the people of Israel to sin.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whose name is 'Jealous'** - it is a part of God's character that he actively pursues to guard his people from worshiping other god's before him.
