{{:en:obs:obs-12-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:obe:other:moses|Moses]]** told the **[[:en:obe:other:israel|Israelites]]**, “**Stop being afraid**! **[[:en:obe:kt:god|God]] will fight for you today and [[:en:obe:kt:save|save]] you**.” Then God told Moses, “Tell the people to **move** toward the **[[:en:obe:other:redsea|Red Sea]]**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **God will fight for you today and save you** - Another way to say this would be, “Today God will defeat the Egyptians for you and keep them from harming you.” 
  * **move** – Some languages will be more specific and say, “walk.”
