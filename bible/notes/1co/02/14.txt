\v 14 Those who are unbelievers reject the truths that  \add God's\add* Spirit teaches us\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add*, because they  \add consider those truths to be\add* foolish. They cannot understand them, because it is God's Spirit who enables us to evaluate those truths correctly, \add and those people do not have God's Spirit\add*.
\v 15 We who have God's Spirit can judge correctly the  \add value of\add* all truths  \add that the Spirit reveals\add*, but  \add unbelievers\add* cannot evaluate us correctly.
\v 16 As  \add one of our prophets wrote:
\add*
\q No human \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* has known what the Lord is thinking. 
\q No human \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* is able to instruct him.
\q But we believers are able to think about things \f + \ft metonymy \f* in the way that Christ thinks about them,

\v 14 Now the natural man cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.
\v 15 But he that is spiritual judges all things, and he himself is judged of no man.
\v 16 For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
