\v 13 And when he that has an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.
\v 14 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before Jehovah to the door of the tent of meeting, and give them to the priest:
\v 15 and the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah for his issue.
