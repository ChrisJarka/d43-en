\v 10 Later, when only the twelve disciples and a few other people were with him, they asked him about the parables.
\v 11 He said to them, "To you I will explain the message concerning God's kingdom, but to the others I will speak in parables.
\v 12 When they see what I am doing, they will not learn.  When they hear what I say, they will not understand.  If they would learn or understand, they would change their mind about their sin, agree with God, and they would be forgiven."

\v 10 When he was alone with those who were close to him and with the Twelve, they asked him about the parables.
\v 11 And he said to them, "To you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables,
\v 12 so that looking they may not see, and hearing they may not understand, or else they would repent and be forgiven."
