====== Introduction to Ezra ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

**Outline of Ezra**\\

  - The first Jewish exiles return to Jerusalem from Persia (1:1-2:70)
  - Rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, and reestablishment of Temple worship (3:1- 6:22)
  - More exiles return, and reformation and implementation of the Law of Yahweh under Ezraâ€™s leadership (7:1-10:44)
    - Ezra teaches the people the Law of Yahweh, and sets apart the priests and Levites (8:1-36)
    - The problem of inter-marriage, and the solution (9:1-10:44)

**What is Ezra about?**\\
Ezra begins with the account of those who first returned to Jerusalem after the exile. The book of Ezra continues the account of the Chronicles. It is about the time when the people of Israel returned from Babylon and their efforts, when back to Canaan, to restore the proper worship of Yahweh. This included the rebuilding of the Temple for sacrifices, the affirmation of the covenant with Yahweh and the restoration of the nation politically. 


**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\ 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Ezra" is named for the events of the book which focus on the pepole who returned to Israel under the leadership of the priest Ezra. It is likely that the books of Ezra and Nehemiah were originally one book but were separated. One possible title is "The book about Ezra."

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
**Why were Israelites not allowed to marry people from other nations?**\\
Yahweh knew that marry foreign wives would cause the people of Israel to worship other [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]].


**Did all of the people of Israel return to their homeland?**\\
Most of the people remained in Babylon and did not return to the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]]. They had a life in Babylon and desired to remain there. The [[:en:obe:kt:remnant|remnant]] who returned to Israel were very [[:en:obe:kt:faithful]] because they returned.

**What was the religious environment like upon the people's return to Israel?**\\
Although there were significant [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sins]] being committed by the people returning to Israel, the [[:en:obe:kt:wordofgod|word of God]] brought them to [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]] and restored their relationship with Yahweh.
