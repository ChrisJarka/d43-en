====== Double Negatives ======


===== Description =====

In some languages people use more than one negative in a phrase simply to express the negative. For example in Brazilian Portuguese "Eu não vi ninguém" has both the word não which means "not" and ninguém, which means "no one." It simply means "I did not see anyone." And in some varieties of English people say  "I didn't see nobody" to mean "I did not see anybody." 

Sometimes people use a double negative to emphasize that the opposite is very true. For example, “It is not unlikely” could mean “It is very likely.”  And "She was not unattractive" could mean "She was very attractive." In this case, it is also a figure of speech called Litotes.

=== Genesis 11:6 ===

"Yahweh said, "Look, they are one people with the same language, and they are beginning to do this! Soon nothing that they intend to do will be impossible for them."

  * **(1) nothing that they intend to do will be impossible for them** - **(3)** This double negative means they can do anything they intend to do. **(4)** This can also be translated as "anything they intend to do will be possible for them." This can also be translated as "they will be able to do anything they want to do." **(5)** (See: Double Negatives)

=== Luke 11:42 ===

"But woe to you Pharisees, because you tithe the mint and rue and every other garden herb, but you neglect justice and the love of God. It is necessary to act justly and love God, without failing to do the other things also."

    * **(1) without failing to do the other things also** - **(3)** This double-negative means they should tithe and do justice and love God.  **(4)** This can be translated as "and to always do the other good things as well." **(5)** (See: Double Negatives)

=== Titus 3:14 ===

"Our people must learn to engage themselves in good works that meet urgent needs so that they may not be unfruitful."

  * **(1) so that they may not be unfruitful**  - **(3)** This double-negative means they should be fruitful or productive. **(4)** This can be translated as "so they will be fruitful" or "so they can produce fruit for God" or "so their lives will be useful." **(5)** (See: Double Negatives)
