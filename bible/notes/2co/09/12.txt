\v 12 We receive this money, not only to help our Christian brothers and sisters in need; we also do it so that many, many believers will thank God.
\v 13 Because you began this task, you have shown what kind of people you are. You honor God by obeying him and believing what he says in the good news about Christ. You also honor him by giving generously.
\v 14 The ones to whom you will give will greatly desire to see you; they will pray for you, because of the wonderful way in which God has been kind to you.
\v 15 We give thanks to God for this gift from himâ€”his gift is so great we cannot express it in words.

\v 12 For carrying out this service not only meets the needs of the believers. It also multiplies into many acts of thanksgiving to God.
\v 13 Because of your being tested and proved by this service, you will also glorify God by obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ. You will also glorify God by the generosity of your gift to them and to everyone.
\v 14 They long for you, and they are praying for you. They do this because of the very great grace of God that is on you.
\v 15 May thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!
