\v 16 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Jehovah his God; for
he went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
\v 17 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of Jehovah, that were valiant men:
\v 18 and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, It pertaineth not to thee, Uzziah, to burn incense to Jehovah,
but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed;
neither shall it be for your honor from Jehovah God.
