===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Micah continues the poem that began in [[:en:bible:notes:mic:07:07|7:8]], speaking as if he were one woman speaking to her enemy, another woman. This is perhaps the daughter of Zion ([[:en:bible:notes:mic:01:13|1:13]]), who represents the people of Israel, speaking to the "daughter of soldiers" ([[:en:bible:notes:mic:05:01|5:1]]), who represents the nations which attacked Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **I will bear his rage** - Rage is spoken of as if it were a solid object that Yahweh was forcing Micah to carry. AT: "I will suffer because he is angry with me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **until he pleads my cause, and executes judgment for me** - Yahweh will punish the people of the other nations who harmed the people of Israel.
  * **he pleads my cause** - Yahweh is spoken of as if he were defending Micah in court. AT: "he defends me against those who harm me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **executes judgment for me** - "brings about justice for me"
  * **He will bring me to the light** - Bringing Micah from darkness ([[:en:bible:notes:mic:07:07|7:8]]) to light is a metaphor for ending the suffering from disaster and enabling him to live well. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **rescue me in his justice** - "bring justice to me and rescue me"
