First person is how a speaker normally refers to himself. English has the first person pronouns ”I” and ”we”. (Also: me, my, mine, us, our, ours)

Second person is how a speaker normally refers to the person or people he is speaking to. English uses the second person pronoun ”you.” (Also: your, yours)

Third person is how a speaker normally refers to someone else. English has the third person pronouns "he", "she", "it" and "they". (Also: him, his, her, hers, its, them, their, theirs)

Sometimes people use the third person to refer to themselves or to the people they are speaking to. See the examples of this from the Bible below. In some languages, first, second, and third person are shown with a prefix or suffix on a word. In some of these languages, using a pronoun in addition to the prefix or suffix indicates a special emphasis on the thing it refers to.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Do what is natural and accurate in your own language. If your language does not always use a pronoun, do not use one simply because English does.

It is important to note that sometimes in the Bible, the text changes from writing in the first person to the third person. You might not be able to do that in your language. Translate with one or the other but maintain accuracy and clarity.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Sometimes people use the third person to refer to themselves or to the people they are speaking to.

//When a person refers to himself in the third person, you may be able to add a first person pronoun for clarification.//

//In 1 Samuel, David was speaking to King Saul about himself. He used the third person when he referred to himself as “your servant” and “his.” He was calling himself Saul's servant in order to show his humility toward Saul. //\\

**1 Samuel 17:34a** And David said to Saul, “**I, your servant** was keeping **my** father’s sheep.”\\ 

//In this next example from Job, God speaks, first calling himself “I” then referring to himself in the third person with the words “God's” and “his.” He did this to emphasize the he is God and he is powerful.//\\ 

**Job 40:6-9** ‘Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm: “Brace yourself like a man; **I** will question you, and you shall answer me. Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself? Do you have an arm like God’s, and can your voice thunder like **his**?”\\

//Sometimes people use the third person when referring to the people they are speaking to after they say "each of you." Jesus used the second person when he called the group of people he was speaking to "__You__ hypocrites." However, after he said "each of  you," he then used a third person pronoun ("his") to refer to each of them. In those cases some languages might need to use a second person pronoun ("your”) to keep the meaning clear.//\\ 

Luke 13:15 Then the Lord answered him, “**You** hypocrites! Does not **each of you** on the Sabbath untie **his** ox or **his** donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it?"
