===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **And I will feed your oppressors with their own flesh; and they will get drunk on their own blood, as if
it were wine** - Here Yahweh is using the metaphor of feeding oppressors their own flesh and making them drink their own blood to making their enemies destroy themselves instead of murdering others. (See: Metaphor)
    * **the Mighty One of Jacob** - This is a shorter way of referring to the descendants of Jacob. AT: "everyone will know that I am the mighty God to whom you descendants of Jacob belong" (UDB)
