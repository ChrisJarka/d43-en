===== Translation Notes: =====





    * **his servant David **- This could be translated as, "King David, who served him."
    * just as he** - Here, this could also be translated as "That is what he promised he would do when he."
    * **spoke through his holy prophets** - That is "caused his holy prophets to say." When God spoke through the prophets, they used their own voices, but God enabled them to speak the words he wanted them to.
    * **enemies..all who hate us**- This is a doublet in which "enemies" and "all who hate us" both refer to those who are against God's people. Another way to translate this would be, "people who fight against us and want to harm us." (See [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:doublet|Doublet]].)
    * **hand**- This could be translated as "power" or "control." This is a metonymy in which "hand" is associated with the power or control that is being used to harm God's people. (See [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy|metonymy]])
