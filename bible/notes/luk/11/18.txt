\v 18 Similarly, if Satan and his demons were fighting against each other, his rule over them would certainly not last! I say this because you are saying that I am expelling demons by the power of the ruler of his own demons!
\v 19 Furthermore, if it is true that Satan enables me to expel demons, is it also true that your disciples who expel demons do so by Satan's power ? No, that is not true. So they will show that you are not thinking logically.
\v 20 But because it is by the power  rule people's lives has come to you."

\v 18 "And if Satan is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand since* you say I cast out the* demons by Beezelbul*?"


\v 19 But if by Beelzebul I cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Because of this*, they shall be your judges.


\v 20  But if by the finger of God I cast out the demons then the kingdom of God has come upon you.*
