  *   * **Behold**  - This can be translated as “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”
  * **Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches and a forested shade and great height! And its tree tops were between the branches** - "Assyria was powerful". This shows the power and majesty of Assyria. (See: Metaphor).
  * **deep** - the sea.
  * **rivers went all around its planting areas** - This indicates that its fields had more than enough water.
  * **channel** - a deep part of a river, harbor, or other body of water where ships can go.
  * **stretched out to all the trees of the field** - Assyria was able to supply the needs of other nations and this increased her strength.
