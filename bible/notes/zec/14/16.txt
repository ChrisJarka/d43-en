\v 16 The people of other nations who previously came to fight against Jerusalem, all those who are still alive, will return \add to Jerusalem\add* every year to worship the King, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, and to celebrate the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters.
\v 17 If there are people in those nations who do not go \add to Jerusalem to worship there\add*, rain will not fall on their land.
\v 18 If the people of Egypt \add or any other nation\add* do not go to Jerusalem, they will not have any rain. And Yahweh will cause them to experience the same plague that afflicted the people of other nations that did not celebrate the Festival of Living in Temporary Shelters.

\v 16 Then it will come about that all who remain from those nations that came against Jerusalem will instead go up from year to year to worship the king,
Yahweh of Hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.
\v 17 And it will come about that if anyone from all the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the king, Yahweh of Hosts, then Yahweh will not bring up rain to them!
\v 18 And if the family of Egypt does not go up and come, then they will not receive rain. A plague from Yahweh will strike the nations that do not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
