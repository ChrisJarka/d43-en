\v 4 Although a person has one body, it consists of many parts. All of the parts are necessary for the body, but they do not all function the same way.
\v 5 Similarly, we, although we are many, are united into one group because we are joined to Christ, and we belong to one another. So no one should act as though he is more important than the others!

<usfm>
\v 4 For just as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function,
\v 5 so we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members of each other.
