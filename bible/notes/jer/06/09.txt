\p
\v 9 Thus says Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again your hand as a
grape-gatherer into the baskets.
\v 10 To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken:
behold, the word of Jehovah is become to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
