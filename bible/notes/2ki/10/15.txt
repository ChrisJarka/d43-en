\v 15 When Jehu departed there he met  Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him, and Jehu greeted him and
said to him, "Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?" Jehonadab answered, "It is." Jehu said, "If it is, give me your hand." And Jehonadab gave him his hand, so Jehu took him up to him into the chariot.
\v 16 Jehu said, "Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh." So he had him ride in his chariot.
