====== courtyard, court ======

===== Definition: =====

A courtyard is an enclosed area that is surrounded by a building or walls. It has no roof, but rather is open to the sky. Sometimes it is called a "court."

  * The temple complex in Jerusalem during the time of Jesus had four major courtyards.
  * The Court of Priests was just outside the temple building and could only be entered by the priests. This was where the basin for washing and the altar for sacrificing were located.
  * The next court further away from the temple building was the Court of Israel which was where any Jewish man could worship and pray.
  * The Court of Women was separated from these inner courts and was where Jewish women could worship. They were not permitted to go into the inner courts.
  * These inner courts were surrounded by a low stone wall that separated them from the larger, outermost court called the Court of the Gentiles. This courtyard was the only place that a nonJew was permitted to be in the Temple complex.
  * The tabernacle was surrounded by only one courtyard, which was enclosed by walls made of thick, cloth curtains rather than stone.
  * Often houses also had open courtyards in the middle that could be entered from doors of the house.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "courtyard" could be translated as "enclosed space" or "walled-in land" or "temple grounds" or "temple enclosure."
  * Sometimes the term "temple" can be translated as "temple courtyards" or "temple courts" when that is what is being referred to.
