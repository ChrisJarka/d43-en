\v 3 But not even Titus who was with me, who was a Greek, did the Jews convince to be circumcised,
\v 4 despite the false brothers sent in secretly to spy on our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus. They desired to make us slaves to the law.
\v 5 We did not yield in submission to them for even an hour, in order that the truth of the gospel might remain unchanged for you.
