====== Search 004: Kim's search ======

~~NOCACHE~~

The script on this page searches for a string of text anywhere in the notes, the ULB, and the UDB. To modify the search, open in edit view and change the text between the quotation marks following the -q.  

//Note: Special characters and symbols must be preceded by a backslash "\".//

To find a TA topic, put the page identifier (last part of the link) between the "" signs in the search string. For example, put "figs_metonymy" to find metonyms. Find the identifiers here: [[:en:phase1:team-info:training:reviewers:talinks]].
