\v 5 Here is my self-praising foolishness: The "super-apostles" are not greater than I am.
\v 6 Even if my speeches are not professionally delivered and I don't use all the latest tricks of the orator, but I make up for any lack in rhetoric by my commanding knowledge of the things of God.

\v 5 For I consider that I am not in the least inferior to those "super-apostles."
\v 6 But even if I am untrained in giving speeches, I am not untrained in knowledge. In every way and in all things we made this known to you .
