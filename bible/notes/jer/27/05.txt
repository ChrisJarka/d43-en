\v 5 I have made the earth, the men and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by my
outstretched arm; and I give it to whom it seems right to me.
\v 6 And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of
the field also have I given him to serve him.
\v 7 And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his sonâ€™s son, until the time of his own land come: and then many
nations and great kings shall make him their bondman.
