\v 6 As for us who have a relationship with Christ Jesus, God is not concerned whether we are circumcised or not circumcised. Instead, God is concerned about whether we trust \add in\add* Christ, with the result that we love \add other people\add*.

\v 5 For in the Spirit by faith we are waiting for the hope of righteousness.
\v 6 In Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but instead only faith working through love.
\v 7 You were running well. Who hindered you that you would not obey the truth?
\v 8 That persuasion is not from him who calls you.
