===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Truly I say unto you **- Could be translated as "I tell you the absolute truth."
  * **whoever says to this mountain, 'May God lift you up and cast you into the sea**  - Jesus says this because his disciples were surprised that he could command a fig tree to wither.  He uses this to show them they should not doubt God's power no matter how large the request. (See: [[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
  * **if he does not doubt in his heart **- The word "heart" is used to refer to the place in a person where emotion is stored.  Your culture may have a different word for this.  This is another way to say a person is worried something might not be true.
