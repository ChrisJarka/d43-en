====== Introduction to Galatians ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of Galatians ===

  - Paul declares his authority as an apostle of Jesus Christ; he says that he is surprised by the false teachings that the Christians in Galatia have accepted from other people (1:1-10).
  - Paul says that people are saved by trusting in Christ alone, not by keeping the law (1:11-2:21).
  - God puts people right with himself only when they trust in Christ; the example of Abraham; the curse which the law brings (and not a means of salvation); slavery and freedom compared and illustrated by Hagar and Sarah (3:1-4:31).
  - When people are joined to Christ, they become free from having to keep the law of Moses. They are also free to live as the Holy Spirit guides them. They are free to refuse the demands of sin. They are free to bear each other's burdens (5:1-6:10).
  - Paul warns the Christians not to trust in being circumcised and in keeping the law of Moses. Instead, they must trust in Christ (6:11-18).

=== What is the Book of Galatians about? ===

Paul wrote this letter to both Jewish and non-Jewish Christians in the region of Galatia. He wanted to write against the false teaching that said that Christians need to follow the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]]. Paul defended the gospel by explaining that salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ. It is a result of the kindness of God and not a result of people doing good [[:en:obe:kt:works|works]]. Any attempt to please God by obeying the law of Moses will bring condemnation by God. 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Galatians," or "Paul's Letter to the Church in Galatia." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What does it mean to "live like Jews" (2:14)? ===

To "live like Jews" means to follow the law of Moses. There were a group of people among the Christians in Galatia, called "Judaizers," who required Gentile Christians to be circumcised and to follow the law of Moses. This was a common problem in the early church and is frequently discussed in the New Testament. 

=== What is syncretism? ===

It was common in the early church to incorporate the worship practices from the previous religious practices of people who came to a saving faith in Christ. In Galatians, some christians not only incorprated Jewish religious customs but pagan practices and holidays as well.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How does Paul use the terms "law" and "grace" in the Book of Galatians? ===

These terms are used in a relatively unique way in Galatians. There is an important teaching in Galatians about Christian living. Under the law of Moses, [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteous]] or [[:en:obe:kt:holy|holy]]] living required a person to follow a set of rules and regulations. As Christians, holy living is now governed by grace. This means a Christian has freedom in Christ and is not required to follow a specific set of rules. Instead, Christians are to live a holy life out of thankfulness for the grace God has shown. This is the "law of Christ."

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Romans? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of manuscripts that many believe are more accurate. The following is the most significant issues in the Book of Galatians:\\

  * "Foolish Galatians, whose evil eye has harmed you? Was not Jesus Christ depicted as crucified before your eyes?" (ULB) (KJV) "O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?" (3:1) 


Translators are advised not to translate this phrase. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have this phrase, it is not wrong to translate it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to the Book of Galatians.
