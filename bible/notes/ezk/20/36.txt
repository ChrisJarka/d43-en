\v 36 As when I judged your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, thus I will judge you!’—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration. 
\v 37 And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;
\v 38 and I will purge from among you the rebellious and the ones transgressing against me from out from the land where they sojourn. I will send 
them out and they will not enter into the land of Israel. So you will know that I am Yahweh!
