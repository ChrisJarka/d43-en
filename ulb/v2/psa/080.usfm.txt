\d For the Chief Musician, set to Shoshanim Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
\q You that lead Joseph like a flock;
\q You that sit above the cherubim, shine forth.
\q
\v 2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might,
\q And come to save us.
\q
\v 3 Turn us again, O God;
\q And cause your face to shine, and we shall be saved.
\b
\q
\v 4 O Jehovah God of hosts,
\q How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?
\q
\v 5 You have fed them with the bread of tears,
\q And given them tears to drink in large measure.
\q
\v 6 You make us a strife to our neighbors;
\q And our enemies laugh among themselves.
\q
\v 7 Turn us again, O God of hosts;
\q And cause your face to shine, and we shall be saved.
\b
\q
\v 8 You brought a vine out of Egypt:
\q You did drive out the nations, and plantedst it.
\q
\v 9 You prepared room before it,
\q And it took deep root, and filled the land.
\q
\v 10 The mountains were covered with the shadow of it,
\q And the boughs thereof were like cedars of God.
\q
\v 11 It sent out its branches to the sea,
\q And its shoots to the River.
\q
\v 12 Why have you broken down its walls,
\q So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?
\q
\v 13 The boar out of the wood does ravage it,
\q And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.
\q
\v 14 Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts:
\q Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,
\q
\v 15 And the stock which your right hand planted,
\q And the branch that you made strong for thyself.
\q
\v 16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down:
\q They perish at the rebuke of your countenance.
\q
\v 17 Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand,
\q Upon the son of man whom you made strong for thyself.
\q
\v 18 So shall we not go back from thee:
\q Quicken you us, and we will call upon your name.
\q
\v 19 Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts;
\q Cause your face to shine, and we shall be saved.
