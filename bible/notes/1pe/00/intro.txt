=== What is the Book of 1 Peter about? ===

Peter states that he wrote this letter for the purpose of “encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God” (5:12).

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 Peter” or "First Peter." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The First Letter from Peter,” or “The First Letter Peter wrote.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of 1 Peter? ===

The letter of 1 Peter was written by the Apostle Peter.  Peter begins his letter by saying who he is and to whom he is writing.  He addresss the letter to all Christians. He refers several times to his readers as "strangers" because they are scattered in different countries.  

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== How were Christians treated in Rome? ===

This letter was probably written from Rome. It appears that when Peter wrote this letter, Christians were being badly persecuted. When Peter speaks of the church that is in Babylon (5:13), he may have been referring to Rome. Or perhaps he was referring to Christians everywhere "in exile," that is, living in this world, away from the full reality of the kingdom of God, where they would be in perfect peace.

Peter explains to those who are persecuted that their true hope is in the return of Christ.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Why are English translation of 1 Peter so different? ===

1 Peter is one of the most difficult books to translate. There are several contributing factors to this. The most significant is that it originally contains many long sentences in Greek. This make the relationship between clauses somewhat uncertain and smooth translation difficult. 

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Peter? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of 1 Peter:\\

  * "through the Spirit" (1:22). Some older versions omit this phrase

Translators are advised not to translate this phrase. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region have it, it is not wrong to translate it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of 1 Peter.
