\v 14 Therefore, you human, prophesy about Gog and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: At that time, when my people of Israel are living safely, you will certainly think about that.
\v 15 So you will come from your place far north \add of Israel\add*, with the armies of many other nations, all riding horses, a huge army.
\v 16 You will march toward my Israelite people, and your soldiers will cover the land like a huge cloud. Gog, I will bring your army to attack the country that belongs to me, but \add what I do\add* for you will show the people of other nations that I am holy.

\v 14 Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: In that day when my people Israel
lives securely, shall you not know it?
\v 15 And you shall come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north, you, and many peoples with thee, all of them
riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army;
\v 16 and you shall come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall come to pass in the latter days,
that I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their
eyes.
