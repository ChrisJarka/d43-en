When you handle pronouns in the way your language likes, people will easily understand who and what your translation is about.\\  

==== Description ====

When we talk or write, we use pronouns to refer to people or things without always having to repeat the noun or name. Usually the first time we refer to someone in a story, we use a descriptive phrase or his name if we think people will know who we are talking about. The next time we might refer to him with a simple noun or by name. After that we might refer to him simply with a pronoun, as long as we think that our listeners will be able to figure out easily who the pronoun refers to.

> Now there was __a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish Council__. __This man__ came to Jesus … Jesus replied to __him__ (John 3:1-3 ULB)

But each language has its rules and exceptions to this usual way of referring to people in things. 
  * In some languages a noun is used instead of a pronoun when starting a new paragraph. 
  * In some language the main character is frequently referred to by a noun or name, but in others he is usually referred to by a pronoun. Some languages have special pronouns that refer only to the main character. 
  * In some languages, something about the subject is shown on the verb. Ins sone of these languages, subject pronouns are only used to emphasize who the subject is, or to clarify who the subject is if it would not be clear without the pronoun.
  * We usually use pronouns to refer to something or someone that we have  already mentioned. However some languages allow a pronoun to refer to something or someone that will be identified later in the sentence.

==== Reason this is a translation issue ==== 
Understand pronouns in the Bible and knowing how to use pronouns in your translation are crucial for producing a translation that will be clearly understood.


===== Examples from the Bible =====

> Again Jesus walked into the synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there. __They__ watched __him__ to see if __he__ would heal __him__ on the Sabbath. (Mark 3:1-2 ULB) 
In some languages it may not be clear who the pronouns "they," "he" and "him" refer to. 

> Certain men came down from Judea and taught __the brothers__, saying, "Unless __you__ are circumcised after the custom of Moses, __you__ cannot be saved." When Paul and Barnabas had a confrontation and debate with them, (Acts 15:1-2)  
The two groups of people are kept separate by putting one inside a direct quotation so that you plural can be used for one group. [[I don't get this one.]]

The pronoun precedes what it refers to. \\
>By __this__ we know that we know him, if __we keep his commandments__. (1 John 2:3 ULB) \\ 




===== Translation Strategies =====
  - Study how your language uses pronouns and use them in the same way. 
  -  If there are two people or things or two groups of people or things make sure that your translation makes it clear which one is being referred to.


===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
1. Study how your language uses pronouns and use them in the same way. \\ 
In English, the pronoun usually follows the noun it refers to.\\ 
** Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?** (1 John 2:22) \\ 
The person who denies that Jesus in the Christ is the real liar! \\ 
In English, in a new chapter a noun phrase, not a pronoun, must be used the first time a person is referred to.\\  
**They watched him to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.** (Mark 3:2)\\ 
This is the beginning of a new chapter and there is no noun to tell who the “they” refers to. 
Some men of the Pharisee sect watched him carefully in order to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath (UDB) The “they” is explained. \\

2. If there are two people or things or two groups of people or things make sure that your translation makes it clear which one is being referred to. \\  
**They watched him to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.** (Mark 3:2) \\  
There are two “he/him” pronouns referring to two different people. It is not clear who is being spoken of. \\ 
Some men of the Pharisee sect watched him carefully in order to see whether he would __heal the man__ on the Sabbath (UDB) One of the “he” has been replaced by “the man.”
