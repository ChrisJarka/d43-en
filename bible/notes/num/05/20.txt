\v 20 But if you, a woman under her husband, have gone astray, if you are defiled, and if some other man has slept with you..."
\v 21 Then the priest must cause the woman to swear an oath that can bring down a curse on her, and then he must continue speaking to the woman, "...then Yahweh will make you into a curse that will be shown to your people to be such. This will happen if Yahweh causes your thigh to waste away and your abdomen to swell.
\v 22 This water that brings the curse will go into your stomach, swell your abdomen, and waste away your thighs." The woman is to reply, "Yes, let that happen if I am guilty."
