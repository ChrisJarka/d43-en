\v 1 Come and let us return to Yahweh.
\q For he has torn but he will heal us,
\q he has injured but he will bandage us.
\v 2 After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.
\v 3 And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come to us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.
