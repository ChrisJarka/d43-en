\v 12 So they will plunder your strength and despoil your merchandise! And they will tear down your walls and your opulent houses until your stone and wood and dust are laid in the midst of the waters.
\v 13 For I will stop the noise of your songs and the sound of your lyres will no longer be heard!
\v 14 For I will make you a bare cliffside; you will become a place for nets to dry out. You will no longer be built up, for I, Yahweh, have declared it!’—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration!
