\v 13 When the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the male child.
\v 14 There were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to a place for her, where she would be looked after for a time, times, and half a time, away from the serpent's presence.
