\q
\v 21 For now you friends are nothing to me;
\q you see my dreadful situation and are afraid.
\q
\v 22 Did I say to you, 'Give something to me?'
\q Or, 'Offer me a gift from your wealth?'
\q
\v 23 Or, 'Save me from my adversary's hand?'
\q Or, 'Ransom me from the hand of my oppressors?'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In these verses, Job poses four questions to rebuke his friends and to emphasize that he did not ask for help from any of them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

  * **For now** - Job uses this phrase to introduce the main part of what he is saying.
  * **you friends are nothing to me** - "you friends have not helped me at all" (UDB)
  * **and are afraid** - This means that they see the trouble Job has and are afraid of being in the same situation. AT: "and you are afraid that God might do similar things to you" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Did I say to you, 'Give something to me?' Or, 'Offer me a gift from your wealth?' Or, 'Save me from my adversary's hand?' Or, 'Ransom me from the hand of my oppressors?'** - Job uses rhetorical questions to emphasize that he did not ask his friends to give him anything or to help him. AT: "I did ask you to give me money or a gift. Nor did I ask you to save me from my adversary or oppressors." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Save me from my adversary's hand ... Ransom me from the hand of my oppressors** - Both of these statements mean the same thing. Also, here "hand" represents power or control. AT: "Save me from my adversary or my oppressors" or "Save me from my adversary" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Ransom me** - "Rescue me"
