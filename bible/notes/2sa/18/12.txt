\v 12 The man replied to Joab, "Even if you gave me a thousand pieces of silver, I would not have done anything to harm [IDI] the king's son. We all heard the king command you and Abishai and Ittai, 'For my sake, do not harm my son Absalom!'
\v 13 If I had disobeyed the king and killed Absalom, the king would have heard about it, because the king hears about everything, and even you would not have defended me!"

\v 12 And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
pieces of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the kingâ€™s son: for in our hearing the king
charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.
\v 13 Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then you yourself would
have set yourself against me.
