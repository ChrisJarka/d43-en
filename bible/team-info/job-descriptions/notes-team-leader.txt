====== Notes Team Leader Responsibilities ======

==== Team Purpose ====

Each Notes team will systematically work through each verse of their assigned book of the Bible and identify the significant issues that may difficulty in translating that verse. The team will address these issues in the following ways:

  * Verify that Important Terms are chosen from the ULB, and that missing terms are added to the list in plain text (do not link the term)
  * Write concise, helpful explanatory notes on each word or phrase that is unclear or difficult to translate
  * Identify problems in the UDB and ULB text that hinder clear, accurate translation

All of the content developed will be released as open-source, unrestricted materials. No copyrighted materials should be included in their creation. It is also understood that the team agrees to have the product of their work freely distributed as open-source.

==== Team Leader Responsibilities ====

The team leader will be responsible for the following:

  * Follow the schedule set by the note team manager to rapidly and conscientiously work through the assigned book.
  * Assign tasks to the team members as needed so the project moves along
  * Encourage and guide the team members in the development of the notes
  * Add a comment in the discussion panel about any questions or suggested changes to the UDB and ULB text and notify the Translation Notes Teams Manager of the suggestion.
  *

Suggest updates to the existing KT pages to Translation Notes Teams Manager.

  *

Communicate with the Translation Notes Teams Manager any concerns and issues with the team members or the project.
