<usfm>
\v 6 \add One day\add* when Josiah was the king of Judah, Yahweh said to me, "Have you seen what the people of Israel have done? They have turned away from me, like a woman who has abandoned her husband and sleeps with other men. They have gone up on every hilltop and under every big tree and worshiped idols there \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 7 I thought that they would return to me, so I said to them, 'Come back to me!' But they refused. So I sent them away \add to other countries, like a man\add* writes a note saying that he is divorcing his wife and then sends his wife away because she has committed adultery \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

\v 6 Moreover Jehovah said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? she
is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.
\v 7 And I said after she had done all these things, She will return to me; but she returned not: and her treacherous sister
Judah saw it.
