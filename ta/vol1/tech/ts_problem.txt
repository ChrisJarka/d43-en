==== Reporting Problems ====

Sometimes translationStudio may not work as expected.

At times the program may restart, also called a 'crash'. This is most likely not because of what the translator did. When this happens, the **Feedback** window will open and a request to type into the space an explanation of what was being done just before the program restarted.

At other times, the translator may want to mention a problem with the program or content. For this:
  - Tap on the 3 dots found at the bottom left of the window. 
  - Choose **Feedback** from the list. 
  - Use the keyboard to type in an explanation of the problem that you have been experiencing.
  - Tap on **Confirm** at the bottom right of the Feedback window. 

=== Asking Questions or Making Suggestions ===
