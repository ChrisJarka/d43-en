\v 23 David did not count those twenty years old or younger, because Yahweh had promised to increase Israel like the stars of heaven.
\v 24 Joab son of Zeruiah began to count the men, but did not finish. Wrath fell on Israel for this. This number was not written down in the Chronicles of King David.
