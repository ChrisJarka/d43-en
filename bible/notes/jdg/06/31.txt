\v 31 But Joash replied, "Are you trying to defend Baal? Are you trying to argue his case? Anyone who tries to defend Baal should be executed by tomorrow morning! If Baal is truly a god, he ought to be able to defend himself, and to get rid of the person who tore down his altar!"
\v 32 From that time, people called Gideon Jerub-Baal, which means 'Baal should defend himself,' because he tore down Baal's altar.

\v 31 And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? he that will contend for him, let him be put to death while it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one has broken down his altar.
\v 32 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he has broken down his altar.
