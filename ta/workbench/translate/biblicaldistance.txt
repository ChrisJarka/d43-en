===== Description =====

The following terms are the most common Biblical units that were used to measure distance or the length of something.

  * The ** cubit **  referred to the length of a man's forearm, from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger.
  * A ** stadium **  (plural, ** stadia **  ) referred to a certain footrace that was about 185 meters in length. Some older English versions translated this word as "furlong", which referred to the average length of a plowed field.
  * The ** span **  or handspan was the width of a man's hand with fingers spread out.
  * The ** "long" cubit **  is used only in Ezekiel 40-48. It is the length of a normal cubit plus a span.

^  Distance ^  Value ^  Units |
|  cubit  |  46 |  centimeters |
|  stadia  |  185 |  meters |
|  span  |  23 |  centimeters |
|  "long" cubit  |  54 |  centimeters |

=== Translation Principles === 

  - Using the Bible terms can show that the Bible is true and that people actually used these unites of measure during that time period.

==== Translation Strategies ==== 

  - Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  - State the same distance or length in terms of a unit of measure that is known. In a footnote or Bible study note it should be explained what the original unit of length was in order to be historically accurate.
  - Use the Bible term and give the equivalent amount in the text or a note.
