\v 13 But now, because of your relationship with Christ Jesus, God has brought you, who had no relationship with him, into his family. He did that because you trusted in what Christ accomplished when he blood flowed from his body when he died on the cross.
\p
\v 14 Christ himself has caused us Jewish and non-Jewish believers to have peace with each other. He has made both of our groups to become one group. Just like people tear down a wall that separates groups of people, he has destroyed the hatred between Jews and non-Jews.
\v 15 By dying for us on the cross he made it no longer necessary for us to obey all the Jewish laws and rituals in order to be saved. He did that in order to enable the two groups to become one new group because of our relationship with him. The result was that he has caused us to have peace with each other.
\v 16 By dying on the cross he caused both Jews and non-Jews to have a peaceful relationship with God. That is how he caused us to no long be enemies with God.

\v 13 But now in Christ Jesus you that once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ.
\v 14 For he is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition,
\v 15 having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; that he might create in himself of the two one new man, so making peace;
\v 16 and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
