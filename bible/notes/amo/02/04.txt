\v 4 Yahweh also said this:
\q1 "\add I will punish the people of\add* Judah because of the many sins \add that they have committed\add*;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them,
\q1 because they have rejected what I taught them
\q2 and they have not obeyed my commands.
\q1 They have been deceived \add and persuaded to worship\add* false gods,
\q2 the same gods that their ancestors \add worshiped\add*.
\q1

\q
\v 4 This is what Yahweh says:
\q "For three sins of Judah,
\q even for four,
\q I will not turn away punishment,
\q because they rejected the law of Yahweh
\q and did not keep his statutes.
\q Their lies caused them to go astray,
\q after which their fathers had also walked.
\q
\v 5 I will send fire on Judah,
\q and it will devour the fortresses of Jerusalem."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For three sins of ... even for four** - This is a poetic device. It does not mean that a specific number of sins had been committed, but indicates that many sins had led to God's judgment. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:01:03|1:3]].
  * **Judah** - This represents the people of Judah. AT: "the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will not turn away punishment** - Yahweh uses two negatives here to emphasize that he will punish them. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:01:03|1:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **Their lies** - This expression here probably refers to worshiping false gods or idols. AT: "Their worship of idols" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **go astray ... walked** - Worshiping false gods is spoken of as if people were walking behind them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **it will devour the fortresses of Jerusalem** - Here Yahweh's judgment is spoken of as if it were a fire that was consuming the fortresses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
