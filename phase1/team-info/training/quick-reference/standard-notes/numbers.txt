====== Numbers ======

===== Definition: =====

We will point translators to the tA page on numbers that can help them figure out how to represent numbers in their language: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]]

For determining whether to write a number with words or numerals, the ULB and UDB text team generally used the two-word rule. If a word could be written with only two words then words were used. If it required more than two words, then  numerals were written.  Words that are hyphenated (twenty-one) are counted as one word. However there are times that the two-word rule was not followed.



We will need to decide whether or not to write notes for cardinal and ordinal numbers. 


===== Standard Notes =====

=== Non-bulleted Notes ===

At the beginning of a chunk. This does not need to be written on every chunk that has numbers, but just the first in a chapter or section.  \\ 
See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] \\   


=== Cardinal Numbers ===
Theses notes would show the number in numerals.

Possible policies: 
  - Write notes only when there is something odd about a number (such as "twelve hundred").
  - Write notes for all numbers that are written with more than two words.
  - Write notes for all numbers that are written with more than one word.
  - Write notes for all numbers written in words starting at a certain number (such as after ten, twenty, one hundred, or one thousand).

  * **twelve hundred** - "1,200" or "one thousand two hundred"

=== Ordinal Numbers === 

Possible policies: 

  - Write notes for all cardinal numbers that have more than one word.
  - Write notes for all hyphenated cardinal numbers.
  - Write notes for all cardinal numbers starting at a certain number.
("Six hundredth occurs once. Other than that, there are no instances of "hundredth" or "thousandth" in the OT ULB.) 

  * **the twenty-first lot** - "lot number 21"
  * **the twenty-seventh day** - "day number 27"


=== Fractions === 

Because most fractions have the same form as ordinal numbers, and because they may be harder to understand, we will probably need notes. 
  * **two thirds** - "two of three equal parts" or "2/3"
  * **one fifth**  - "one of five equal parts" or "1/5"
