\v 10 Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear; for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do:
\v 11 Therefore let no man despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me. For I expect him along with the brothers.
\v 12 Now concerning Apollos the brother, I strongly encouraged  him to come to you with the brothers: And he decided not to come now; but he will come when he has opportunity.
