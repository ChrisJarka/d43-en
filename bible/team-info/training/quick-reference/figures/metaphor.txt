====== Metaphor ======


===== Description =====

A metaphor is a figure of speech that creates a 'word picture' by relating one thing (the topic of the metaphor) to an unrelated object. Metaphors imply (or state directly) that the two things have something in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it. A metaphor transfers an image from one familiar object to another object that is less easily understood.

=== Act:07:39 ===

"This is the man whom our forefathers refused to obey; they pushed him away from themselves, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt."

  * ** (1) pushed him away from themselves** - **(3)** Topic: The Israelites rejecting Moses. Image: one man pushing another man away. Similarity: As one man pushes another man away from him, so the Israelites pushed Moses away by rejecting his leadership over them.  **(4)** It can be translated as "they rejected him as their leader" (UDB). **(5)** (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])

=== 1Ti:01:02 ===

"To Timothy, a true son in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. "

  * **(1) true son ** - **​(2)** "real son." **3** Topic: Timothy's devotion to Paul. Image: The devotion of a child to his own father. Similarity: As a child is devoted to his father, so was Timothy's devotion to imitating Paul's devotion to Christ as if Timothy was actually Paul's son. **(4)** This can be translated as "You are like a true son to me"  **(5)** (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
