\c 13
\p
\v 1 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.
\v 2 And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to
remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
\v 3 And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it
profiteth me nothing.
\v 4 Love suffers long, and is kind; love envies not; love boasts not itself, is not puffed up,
\v 5 does not behave itself unseemly, seeks not its own, is not provoked, takes not account of evil;
\v 6 rejoices not in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;
\v 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopeth all things, endures all things.
\v 8 Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether
there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there
be knowledge, it shall be done away.
\v 9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
\v 10 but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.
\v 11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put
away childish things.
\v 12 For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I
was fully known.
\v 13 But now remains faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.
