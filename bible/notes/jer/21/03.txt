\v 3 Then said Jeremiah to them, Thus shall you say to Zedekiah:
\v 4 Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith you
fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans that besiege you, without the walls; and I will gather them into

great indignation.
