====== Return to Manager ======

When repetitive issues appear in the notes, it is more efficient for the project to return them to the manager for correction. The manager will then decide whether to update the notes, or to return them to the notes team. Rather than repeatedly fixing the same issues, it is preferred that the issue become a "teaching occasion" to help prevent future occurrences of known problems.


  * KT lists out of order. The entries should match the order of the first occurrence of the item in the ULB. 
  * TNs where shorter entries precede the longer entries in which they are found, e.g., 
    * Do not write:
      * the canine bit the feline - "the house was in disorder" 
      * canine - dog 
      * feline - cat 
    * but write:
      * canine - dog
      * the canine bit the feline - "the house was in disorder" * feline - cat Notes that add nothing that is not in the UDB. 
  * The user is supposed to refer to the UDB only if the ULB is not clear. If he still needs help, he goes to the KT. Only if he's still in the dark does he go to the TN. The UDB only needs to be repeated in the TN if it's the basis for further clarification (e.g., one of two alternative meanings, or if it's 80% clear but needs a tweak to get the rest of the way). 
  * Extra words that the managers should know we're deleting, e.g.,
    * Do not write:
      * Australians eat spaghetti on toast for breakfast - The word "spaghetti" refers to a meal of noodles and sauce.
    * But write:
      * spaghetti - a meal of noodles and sauce
    * Do not write:
      * I like to consume apples and bananas - "I like to eat apples and bananas"
   * But write:
     * consume - "eat" 
  * To "send back" means to instantly tag as "check": if you see it right away, you tag it right away and move on.
