===== Creating a New File =====

//This answers the question:// //How is a new file created?//

During the recording phase, you will capture the sounds as an audio file and give it a name (see File Naming Standards). In most software and on most hardware devices, you will create a new file in one of these ways:

  * Press Ctrl+N
  * Click or tap on the RECORD button

Some software will ask you to set the audio file properties before proceeding. If you are not asked this question, check the software or device setting to make sure it is set to the correct attributes. The standard we recommend is:

  * Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz
  * Bit Depth: 16
  * Channels: Mono
  * Format: WAV (or WAV PCM Linear)

Note: Some software may not prompt you to choose a format until you Save the file. Some software many not offer a Bit Depth selection, which usually means the software defaults to the widely-accepted standard of 16-bit.
