<usfm>
\v 19 I do not do the good things that I want to do. Instead, it is evil things that I do not want to do that I do.
\v 20 Because I do \add evil things\add* that I do not want to do, it is not that I do \add evil things because I want to\add*. Instead, \add I do them because\add* my self-directed nature, which permeates me \f + \ft personification \f*, \add causes me to do them\add*.
\v 21 I find, then, that what always happens is that when I want to do what is good, there is an evil \add desire\add* present within me that \f + \ft personification \f* \add prevents me from doing good\add*.

\v 20 Because I do evil things that I do not want to do, it is not that I do evil things because I want to. Instead, I do them because my self-directed nature, which permeates me , causes me to do them.
\v 21 I find, then, that what always happens is that when I want to do what is good, there is an evil desire present within me that  prevents me from doing good.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 For the good that I want I do not do, but the evil that I do not want, that I do.
\v 20 But if what I do not want, that I do, I no longer work it out, but sin which lives in me.
\v 21 I find then the influence, while  wanting to do good, that evil is present in me.
