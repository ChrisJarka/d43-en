A basic translation process for Open Bible Stories is explained here. Note: the recommendations of the [[http://www.forum-intl.org/resources|Forum of Bible Agencies]] is a helpful reference in the translation of any theological text.

==== Translating the Text ====

As you translate Open Bible Stories, be sure that you: 
  * pray that God would help you make an easily-understandable, Scripturally-accurate translation
  * translate everything that is in the source language
  * don't add anything that that is not necessary for comprehension
  * always do your translation according to the [[en:translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines]]
  * always do your translation according to the [[en:statement-of-faith|Statement of Faith]]

==== Where To Start Translating ====

You can work your way through the Stories however you want, but we have found [[en:obs:31|Story #31]] is a good first story to translate since it is short and easy to understand. 

==== Translate from the Source Language ====

It is best to open the webpage of the story in your language and the webpage of the story with Translation Notes.

This [[http://youtu.be/73tAlcffiLU|video]] (10 minutes) will give a quick overview of how to use the Translation Notes when translating. The Translation Notes pages are designed to help write accurate translations.

The video assumes you understand the above instructions. The video uses the graphical editor. Here is a summary of the process:

  * Find stories in your heart language that have not been translated that you want to work on.
  * Open the Translation Notes in a new window and arrange the windows side-by-side.
  * Have both the [[:en:obs-training:01|Translation Notes]] and the Heart Language windows on the same story.
  * In the Translation Notes window note the Picture or Frame Number (number in [ ] after the story title).
  * Open the graphical (FCK Edit) editor in the heart language window and scroll down to the desired frame. Compare the picture .
  * Read the Notes for help on how to translate some of the words and terms.

**Once you have chosen the correct words or terms in your language, arrange the translated words so they make sense and the stories are easy to read and understand.**

  * Continue editing frames and saving your work.
  * Enjoy and share the new translation.
