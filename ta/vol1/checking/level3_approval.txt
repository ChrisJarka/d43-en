===== Level 3 Approval =====

This module answers the question: How can I affirm my approval of the translation?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:checking:level3_questions|Questions for Checking on Level Three]]

I, as a representative of the _ _ _      _ _ _ Bible translation Organization or the _ _ _ _ _  _ Church Network serving the _ _ _ _ _ _ language community, approve of the translation, and affirm the following:
   - The translation conforms to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines.
  - The translation is accurate and clear in the target language.
  - The translation uses an acceptable style of the language.
  - The community approves of the translation.
If any problems remain unresolved after meeting with the translation team a second time, please make note of them here.
