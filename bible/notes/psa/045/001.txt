  * **My heart overflows - **  The word "overflows" means to flow over the top edge of a container. The author compares the happiness that fills his heart to water that flows over the top of a container. AT: "I have more happiness than my heart can contain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **composed**  - to have written or created a song.
  * **my tongue is the pen of a ready writer**  - The author's tongue is compared to the pen of a ready writer because the author is ready to begin to speak and he uses his tongue to speak as the writer uses a pen to write. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You are fairer**  - The word "you" refers to the king. AT: "O King, you are more handsome"
  * **grace is poured onto your lips**  - The lips of the king refers to his ability to speak. Poured grace expresses that God has greatly blessed the king's ability to speak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
