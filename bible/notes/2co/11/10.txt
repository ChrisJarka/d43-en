\v 10 And assure as you know that everything that Christ says is true, you can be sure that what I say to you now is true. Wherever I go there in Achaia province, I do not let you believers pay me for doing God's work among you. And no one will be able to prevent me from boasting about that.
\v 11 No one should wrongly think that it is because I do not love you that I do not take pay from you. God knows that you truly are very dear to me.
