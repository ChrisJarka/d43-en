===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **second month**  - This refers to the second month of the year and not the second month from Noah's birthday.
  * **the fountains of the great deep burst open**  ​- "water from underground rushed up to the surface"
  * **the great deep**  - This refers to underground water sources.
  * **the windows of heaven were opened**  - This can be translated as "the sky opened." It is figurative language that means "the rain in the sky poured down."
  * **rain** - "downpour" or "torrential rain." If your language has a word for "heavy rain," it would be appropriate here.
