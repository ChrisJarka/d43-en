====== lots, casting lots ======

===== Definition: =====

A "lot" is a marked object that is thrown or picked from among other similar objects as an unbiased way of making a choice or decision. God's people used it as a way of finding out what God wanted them to do.

  * One example of drawing lots is when a straw is selected from a group of straws of unknown but different lengths; the person who selects the shortest (or longest) straw is the winner (or loser)..
  * When people in the Bible cast lots, they may have tossed or rolled small marked stones or broken pieces of pottery. The person who rolled the specially marked piece would be chosen.
  * Some cultures use a bunch of straws for drawing lots. Someone holds the straws so that no one can see how long they are. People each pick a straw and the one who picks the longest (or shortest) straw is the one who is chosen.
  * The phrase "casting lots" can be translated as "tossing lots" or "drawing lots" or "rolling lots". Make sure it does not sound like they were being thrown a long way.
