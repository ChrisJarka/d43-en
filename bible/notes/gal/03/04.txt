\v 4 All the things you experienced after you believed in Christ--whether good things or bad things--they would have been of no value at all if you had not been trusting in him.
\v 5 When God now generously gives to you his Spirit and performs miracles among you, do you think that it is because you obey God's Law? Surely you know it is because when you heard the Good News about Christ, you trusted in him!

\v 5 Therefore, does he who gives the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do it by the works of the law or by the hearing with faith?
