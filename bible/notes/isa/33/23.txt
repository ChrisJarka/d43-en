===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Your riggings are slack; they cannot hold the mast in place; they cannot spread the sail** - This compares a boat that is floating in the ocean because its ropes are useless in holding the mast or the sail, to a people who are powerless. "The ropes of their boats will hang loose; they cannot keep the mast upright; they cannot make the sail open"
  * **when the great spoil is divided** - "when the treasures they seized will be divided among us"
  * **even the lame will drag off the spoil** - "even the lame people will get some of the treasures"
