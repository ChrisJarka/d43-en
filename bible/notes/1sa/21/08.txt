\v 8 David asked Ahimelech, "Do you have a spear or a sword \add that I could use\add*? The king \add appointed us to do\add* this task \add and told us to leave\add* immediately, so I did have time to bring any weapons."
\p
\v 9 Ahimelech replied, "I have only the sword that belonged to Goliath the \add giant from\add* the Philistia people-group whom you killed in Elah Valley. It is wrapped in a cloth, and is behind the sacred vest \add in the Sacred Tent\add*. If you want it, take it, because I have no other \add weapon\add* here."

\v 8 And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under your hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword
nor my weapons with me, because the kingâ€™s business required haste.
\v 9 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here
wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it; for there is no other save that here. And David said,
There is none like that; give it me.
