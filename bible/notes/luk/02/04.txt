\v 4-5 Joseph also traveled to his family's hometown, along with Mary who was engaged to him and was pregnant. Because Joseph was a descendant of King David, they left the town of Nazareth in the region of Galilee and traveled to the town of Bethlehem, which is also known as the city of David. Joseph and Mary went there to be registered in the public record.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **traveled to the town of Bethlehem**  - That is, "went up" in elevation. Bethlehem was higher in elevation than Nazareth.
    * **city of David **- Bethlehem was called a city because of its importance, not its size. King David was born there and there was a prophecy that the Messiah would be born there. "City of David" can also be translated as "city of King David."
    * **to register along with Mary**  - Mary traveled with Joseph from Nazareth. It is likely that women were also taxed, so Mary would have needed to travel and be registered as well.
    * **who was engaged to him**  - An engaged couple was considered legally married, but there would not have been physical intimacy between them. (See Luke 1:27 translation notes). This could also be translated as "his fianc√©e" or "who was promised to him."
    * **expecting a child**  -That is, "was pregnant" or, "with child."
