====== 1 Corinthians 07:5-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 You may refuse \add to have sexual relations with\add* each other \f + \ft euphemism \f* only if you both first agree to do that for a short time, in order that you may both have more time to pray. Then after that, begin having sexual relations again \f + \ft euphemism \f* in order that Satan will not be able to persuade you \add to have sex with someone else\add* because you are unable to control your sexual desires.
\p
\v 6 I am telling you these things to say that \add God\add* allows \add you to get married, but he\add* does not say that you must \add get married\add*.
\v 7 I myself wish that all people would stay \add unmarried\f + \ft Or: single \f*\add*, as I am. But God has enabled each person to live in different ways. He has enabled some people to \add live without getting married\add*, and he has enabled other people to \add get married\add*.

===== UDB: =====

\v 5 The first principle is that, in your marriage, you should not deprive one another of sexual intimacy. It is part of the marriage relationship. There may be good and sufficient times when you come away from this kind of intimacy (as in times of prayer), but there should be specific, short-term limits for how long this lasts, and an agreement to come together again after that time is passed. Satan can tempt you to sexual sin in many ways if you do not come together again as husband and wife. Do not let your lack of self-control bring sin into your marriage. 
\p
\v 6 These instructions are about what I know is true of marriage and of you, and I am telling you these things not as commands, but as a consession to help you in your struggles in these matters.
\v 7 My example is before you: I wish, for the purpose of serving God, everyone were single, as I am. But God gives many different gifts to his children, and marriage and singleness are among them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Do not deprive one another sexually, except by mutual agreement and for a specific period of time, so you may devote yourselves to prayer. And then you may come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
\p
\v 6 But now I say these words to you more as a concession to your struggles and not as a command. 
\v 7 I wish that everyone were as I am. But each one has his own gift from God, one of this kind and another of that kind.
