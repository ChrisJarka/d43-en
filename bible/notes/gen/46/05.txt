===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **ULB 46:5 Israel**  - be sure to look at the "Israel" link in **Important Terms**
  * **rose up from**  - "set out from"
  * **accumulated**  - "acquired"
  * **his sons' sons**  - "his grandsons"
  * **his sons' daughters**  - "his granddaughters"
  * **ULB 46:7 He**  - "Jacob" … Although being transported on a cart to Egypt, he still is in charge of this move. It is his decision to go, to take all his family, to stop at Beersheba. This is an important concept of family respect that should be maintained in your translation.
