<usfm>
\v 8 And just as Yahweh had predicted, my cousin Hanamel came to see me in the courtyard of the palace. He said, "Please buy my field at Anathoth in the area where the descendants of Benjamin live. It is written in our laws that you have the right to buy it before I ask if anyone else wants to buy it." When he said that, I knew that the message that I had received was truly from Yahweh.
\p
\v 9 So, I bought the field at Anathoth. I paid Hanamel seventeen pieces of silver for it.

\v 8 So Hanamel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said to me, Buy
my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the
redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah.
\v 9 And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels
of silver.
