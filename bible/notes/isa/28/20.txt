===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For the bed is too short for a man to stretch out on, and the blanket too narrow for him to wrap himself in** - The warning in verse 19 is as bad as having a bed and a blanket that is smaller than the man who tries to sleep on it.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim; he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon** - "Yahweh will cause you to be defeated miraculously like he did to the Philistines at Mount Perizim and in the Valley of Gibeon"
  * **to do his work, his strange work, and perform his strange deed** - Yahweh will use the Assyrians to punish the Israelites.  This seemed like strange work. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
