===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 46 Suppose that they sin against youâ€”since there is no one who does not sin, and suppose that you are angry with them and hand them over to the enemy, so that the enemy carries them away captive to their land, whether distant or near. \v 47 Then suppose that they realize they are in the land where they have been exiled, and suppose that they repent and seek favor from you from the land of their captors. Suppose that they say, 'We have acted perversely and sinned. We have behaved wickedly.' </usfm>
