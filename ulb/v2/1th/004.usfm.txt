\c 4
\p
\v 1 Finally then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as you received of us how you ought to walk and
to please God, even as you do walk,â€”that you abound more and more.
\v 2 For you know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
\v 3 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you abstain from fornication;
\v 4 that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
\v 5 not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who know not God;
\v 6 that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in the matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also
we forewarned you and testified.
\v 7 For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.
\v 8 Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
\p
\v 9 But concerning love of the brethren you have no need that one write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love
one another;
\v 10 for indeed you do it toward all the brethren that are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that you abound more
and more;
\v 11 and that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you;
\v 12 that you may walk becomingly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing.
\p
\v 13 But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that you sorrow not, even as the rest, who
have no hope.
\v 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also that are fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with
him.
\v 15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left to the coming of the Lord,
shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep.
\v 16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God:
and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
\v 17 then we that are alive, that are left, shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air:
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
\v 18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
