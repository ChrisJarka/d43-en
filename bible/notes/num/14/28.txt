\v 28 Say to them, As I live, says Jehovah, surely as you have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:
\v 29 your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, that have murmured against me,
\v 30 surely you shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
