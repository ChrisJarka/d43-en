\v 26 But you should not be like them! Instead, those who \add want God to\add* \add consider them\add* the greatest should \add act as though they\add* were the youngest, \add since the youngest are expected to serve the older ones\add*. Whoever is a leader should be one who serves \add the others\add*.
\v 27 Keep in mind who is the most important one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. It is certainly the one who \add just sits\add* at the table, not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* those who serve \add the meal\add*. But I, \add your leader\add*, have been \add an example for you\add* by serving you \add while I have been\add* among you.

\v 26 But it shall not be like this with you. Instead, let the one that is the greatest among you become like the youngest. And let the one that is the most important become like the one that serves.
\v 27 For which is greater, the one that sits at the table, or the one that serves? Is it not the one that sits at the table? Yet I am among you as one that serves.
