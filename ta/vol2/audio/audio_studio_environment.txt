===== The Studio Recording Environment =====

This module answers the question: What is a studio recording environment?\\
===  ===

The studio recording environment typically is a place where a significant level of investment and preparation has been made to create a permanent space with favorable conditions for recording projects to occur with efficiency. 

Generally speaking a studio will have at least one room where adequate acoustical treatment has been done in order to optimize sound quality. Most of this treatment is permanent, but some may be removable so as to allow greater flexibility in the types of audio production a studio can accommodate.

Most studios will be equipped with all the basic equipment needed for voice recording, positioned in place and ready to use. Some studios may have additional equipment on hand for other types of audio production or to select better-matched equipment for a narrator's voice, for example.

Many studios will have some capacity for climate control and will be equipped with electrical power, perhaps even a battery backup system.

Studios will often have a staff that includes a recordist, project coordinator or other essential roles of the recording process.

Advantages of a studio can be:

  * A dependable, stabilized workspace with few variable to contend with during the process
  * A room that has received acoustic treatments to improve suitability for recording (although not guaranteed to be improvements â€“ use your own ears to evaluate)
  * Equipment designed for voice recording in place and ready to use every day (although not guaranteed to be correct design for voice recording)
  * Experienced staff available for hire to aid in project (although not guaranteed to be proficient)

Disadvantages of a studio can be:

  * Is not mobile, so it may be a very long distance to travel for participants of a project.
  * Permanent infrastructure requires initial investment and ongoing maintenance.
  * In many cases, a continual income is typically needed to keep facility in operation with staff employed to keep operation viable.
