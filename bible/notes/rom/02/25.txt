\v 25 Any one of you who  is circumcised  to show that he belong to God can benefit from that if he obeys the laws  God gave to Moses. But if you, a circumcised person, disobey  God's laws, God will consider that you who are circumcised are no better in God's sight than someone who is not circumcised.
\v 26 This means that God will certainly consider that even non-Jews who are not circumcised can become his people if they obey the things that he commanded in his laws. So will not God consider that even non-Jews who are not circumcised can become his people if they obey the things that he commanded in his laws?
\v 27  If any one of you disobeys God's laws, even though you have the Scriptures and even though someone has circumcised you God will punish you. And those people who are not circumcised, but who obey God's laws, will declare that God is right when he says that he will punish you.

\v 25 For circumcision indeed benefits, if you accomplish the Law, but if you be a violator of the Law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
\v 26 If therefore the one uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be considered for circumcision?
\v 27 Will not the naturally uncircumcised, if it fulfills the Law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision are a violator of the Law?
