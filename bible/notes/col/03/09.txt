\v 9 Do not lie to one another. Do not do those things, because you have disposed of\f + \ft Or: stopped obeying \f* your former evil nature and stopped doing what you did when you had that former \add evil\add* nature,
\v 10 and because you have received a new nature. God is causing your new nature to become more and more like his own nature. He created your new nature in order that \add you might get to\add* know \add God\add* truly.
\v 11 As a result of that, it is not \add important whether anyone is a\add* non-Jew or a Jew, or \add whether anyone is\add* circumcised or not, or \add whether anyone is\add* a foreigner, or even uncivilized, or \add whether anyone is\add* a slave or not a slave. But \add what is important is\add* Christ, who is supremely important in every way.

<usfm>
\v 9 Do not lie to one another, for you have stripped off your old self with its practices,
\v 10 and you have put on your new self, which God is renewing into the knowledge of his image, the image of the one who created your new self.
\v 11 In this knowledge, there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but instead Christ is all and in all.
