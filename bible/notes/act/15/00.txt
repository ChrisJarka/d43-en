====== Acts 15 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 15:16-18, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

The events of this chapter are commonly called the "Jerusalem Council." This was a time when man church leader got together to discuss the relationship between the Gentiles in the Law of Moses. It was affirmed that the gentiles did not need to follow the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Mosaic Law]]. In fact, no one within the church should follow this law. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Brothers ==
Brothers is now being used to reference fellow believers in Jesus instead of fellow Jews. 

== "you cannot be saved" ==
This is obviously a false conception. Even during the Old Testament times, a person was [[:en:obe:kt:save|saved]] by their faith and not by their obedience to the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]]. Paul and Barnabas went to Jerusalem to discuss this issue so that church could have unity.

== "Turn away from things sacrificed to idols, blood, things strangled, and from sexual immorality" ==
It is possible that these actions are necessary for harmony between the Jews and Gentiles.
