\v 40 When I \add return\add*, I \add will not take all people up to heaven. I will take only those who trust in me. For example\add*, two \add people\add* will be in the fields. One of them will be taken \f + \ft Or:\add I\add* will take one of them \f* up \add to heaven\add* and the other \add person\add* will be left \f + \ft Or:and I will leave the other \add person\add* \f* \add here to be punished\add*.
\v 41 \add Similarly\add*, two \add women\add* will be at the mill grinding grain. One of them will be taken up \add to heaven\add* and the other will be left.
\v 42 So, because you do not know what day \add I\add*, your Lord, will return \add to the earth\add*, you need to be ready \add for me to return at any time\add*.
