=== What is the book of Ephesians about? ===

Ephesians is a letter about God's relation to his people, the riches and blessings he gives to them in Christ, and how God's people relate to one another and the love and unity they should have in the church. The letter begins with the theology of salvation—what God did to save his people. God acted with sovereign power to choose those who would believe, and he did that before the world was made. Salvation is a gift of God and it is the plan that was God's pleasure and his will.  
 
The great themes of Ephesians caused Paul to praise and prayer as he was writing. Christ's work of redemption not only forgives our sins, but it accomplishes reconciliation on many levels. The reconciling working of Christ gives us peace with God. His work reconciles everything that exists to God. His work makes peace between Jews and Greeks and with all within the body of Christ. These themes in Ephesians, the work of God, the sacrifice of Christ, the church, Christian maturity, the new life, all work in us because we are now in Christ and we live in him, and he lives in us.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Ephesians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul's Letter to the Church in Ephesus,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Ephesus.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Ephesians? ===

Paul of Tarsus wrote this letter while in prison. Ephesians may have been a letter intended for several churches in the region near the city of Ephesus, and it may have been addressed to each church separately. Paul was also known as “Saul” when he was a Pharisee and a persecutor of the church before his conversion to faith in Christ. He was a scholar in the Jewish law, but he became a Christian and an apostle of Jesus Christ.

=== What was Paul's relationship to the church in Ephesus? ===
Paul helped to establish the church in Ephesus earlier in his ministry. He also lived in Ephesus for a year and a half and helped the church during this time.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
=== What is the "mystery" Paul mentions in Ephesians? ===

This mystery is not something confusing or difficult to explain but is something that was once hidden or unknown.  This "mystery" has now been made known. This is the teaching that the Gentiles now get to take part in the promises of Christ as equals with the Jews. This is the body of Christ, the church.

=== What is the relationship between salvation and [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteous]] living? ===

This is a major theme of this letter and many of Paul's letters in general. Christians have been shown great grace by God because they have placed their faith in Jesus. After their salvation, [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteous]] living demonstrates faith instead of through obedience to the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]]. Now, Christians are to live in a way that reflects their new life in Christ.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What does Paul mean by the "new self" or the "new man"? ===

An important part of Paul's theology in the book of Ephesians is that a person is [[:en:obe:kt:bornagain|born again]] when they believe in Jesus and become a new creation in Christ. Prior to being born again, a person is "[[:en:obe:kt:enslave|enslaved]] to [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]]," but after they are born again, they are freed from this and have new [[:en:obe:kt:life|life]] "in Christ."

=== Why are there so many commands in the Ephesians Chapters 4-6? ===
It appears that in the first three chapters of Ephesians, Paul gives various teachings to the church in Ephesus. Because of this, there is only one command in these chapters. The final three chapters contain many commands. This gives the reader the impression that Paul is urging the reader to follow his instructions. These sections are separated by the word "therefore" in 4:1. It probably has significance. The book's overall structure explains "this is who you are in Christ and what Christ has done for you, therefore go and live good lives."

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Ephesians? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of manuscripts that many believe are more accurate. The follow are the most significant issues in the Book of Ephesians:

  * Some early manuscripts omit "in Ephesus" (1:1) but this is probably in the original letter
  * “of His flesh and of His bones.” (5:30)

Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to the Book of Ephesians.
