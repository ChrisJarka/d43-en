<usfm>
\v 1 The first \f + \ft Or: most important \f* thing that I urge  \add you to tell your congregation\add* is that  \add Christians\add* should continually ask  \add God\add* for  \add what they need\add*. They should also pray to God  \add for all other people\add*, and they should be thanking  \add God\add*.
\v 2 Specifically, they should pray for rulers and for all  \add other people\add* who are in important government positions\f + \ft Or: have authority \f*, in order that  \add God will help them to rule\add*. \add As God enables the rulers to rule well\add*, we can live very peaceably as we conduct ours lives doing all that God and others consider to be right and proper.
\v 3 It is good  \add to pray like that, and\add* it pleases God, who saves us, when we pray like that.
\v 4 He desires to save all people. He wants everyone to fully know  \add and accept\add* his true  \add message\add*.
