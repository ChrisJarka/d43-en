\v 10 And the disciples came, and said to him, Why speak you to them in parables?
\v 11 And he answered and said to them, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
is not given.
\v 12 For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken
away even that which he hath.
