==  ==

It is easy for both beginners and experienced recordists to become intrigued with all of the available gadgets and digital processing available in audio recording today. However, keeping things simple and basic is not only our recommended approach, but also the wisest approach in nearly every recording scenario. In fact, things rarely go wrong when the equipment and process is kept simple. By contrast, every additional piece of equipment, adapters, processing steps, logistical complications extra participants, etc. - all of these unnecessary complications increase the likelihood for errors, problems, project down time, stress and discouragement.

Our recommended approach is simplicity. 

In regard to equipment, a basic setup will be the most reliable, each piece designed and tuned to do its task well. Every piece is compatible and no unnecessary pieces of equipment, cables or software processes are taking up space or creating the increased potential for problems.

In regard to the team, a small team that is committed to the project, understands their roles and works as a team will likely have excellence in their efforts. Making projects too complicated from a staff or participant standpoint will often introduce new complications into the project and decrease efficiency.
