====== Genesis 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Beginning in 6:22, the author starts giving summary statements about events that he tells about again in the following text. And in the next chapter, he sometimes gives summary statements that introduce events for the first time. If these statements and the surrounding events are not carefully translated, readers can believe that the same events happened twice or three times instead of only one time. So translators should be careful not to give that impression.
