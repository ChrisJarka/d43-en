===== Style =====

This module answers the question: //What are the style standards for unfoldingWord audio?//

The style standards identified below are selected because they enable the best flexibility for a wide variety of listening settings including personal, family, church, radio broadcast, etc. These standards also provide the best longevity for value across generations, future versatility and consistency with the most common style preferences requested by the global Church for audio Scripture content.

  * Use narration-style approach with natural emotion, rhythm and nuance.
  * Narrator(s) must be a native speaker of language and culturally acceptable for conveying Biblical content.
  * Avoid unnecessary or excessive changing of narrators within a recording. Too many changes can be distracting to the listener. A change of narrator should not occur within a single chapter or story.
  * No sound effects, background music, dramatization, multi-voice acting, theatrical-style voicing or emphasis that suggests a presumed interpretation of the Scripture passage onto listeners.

Note: In regard to style, there is a great degree of diversity in the way media content can be created with excellence. Our style standards are not to suggest that no other culturally appropriate styles exist for various types of media content. Instead, they serve to reflect characteristics identified as highly valuable to the global Church specifically in the area of Biblical content.
