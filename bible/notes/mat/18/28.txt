===== Translation Notes: =====

  * Jesus continues telling his story that illustrates forgiveness.
  * **one hundred denarii**  - a manageable amount of money equal to less than one year's wages which could easily be repaid.
  * **grasped**  - means to "take hold of" or "grab" (UDB adds clarity)
  * **implored him**  - "begged him"
  * **But his fellow-servant fell down and implored him**  - Matthew is using irony to highlight the similarities between the two servants and the master's response to the first servant and the first servant's response to his fellow servant.
