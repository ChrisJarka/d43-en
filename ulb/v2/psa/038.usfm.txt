\c 38
\d A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.
\q
\v 1 O Jehovah, rebuke me not in your wrath;
\q Neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.
\q
\v 2 For your arrows stick fast in me,
\q And your hand presses me sore.
\q
\v 3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation;
\q Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
\q
\v 4 For mine iniquities are gone over my head:
\q As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
\q
\v 5 My wounds are loathsome and corrupt,
\q Because of my foolishness.
\q
\v 6 I am pained and bowed down greatly;
\q I go mourning all the day long.
\q
\v 7 For my loins are filled with burning;
\q And there is no soundness in my flesh.
\q
\v 8 I am faint and sore bruised:
\q I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
\q
\v 9 Lord, all my desire is before thee;
\q And my groaning is not hid from thee.
\q
\v 10 My heart throbbeth, my strength fails me:
\q As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
\q
\v 11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague;
\q And my kinsmen stand afar off.
\q
\v 12 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me;
\q And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things,
\q And meditate deceits all the day long.
\q
\v 13 But I, as a deaf man, hear not;
\q And I am as a dumb man that opens not his mouth.
\q
\v 14 Yea, I am as a man that hears not,
\q And in whose mouth are no reproofs.
\q
\v 15 For in thee, O Jehovah, do I hope:
\q You will answer, O Lord my God.
\q
\v 16 For I said, Lest they rejoice over me:
\q When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
\q
\v 17 For I am ready to fall,
\q And my sorrow is continually before me.
\q
\v 18 For I will declare mine iniquity;
\q I will be sorry for my sin.
\q
\v 19 But mine enemies are lively, and are strong;
\q And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
\q
\v 20 They also that render evil for good
\q Are adversaries to me, because I follow the thing that is good.
\q
\v 21 Forsake me not, O Jehovah:
\q O my God, be not far from me.
\q
\v 22 Make haste to help me,
\q O Lord, my salvation.
