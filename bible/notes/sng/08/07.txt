===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Surging waters cannot quench love nor can floods sweep it away. **- The woman is continuing to compare their love to fire. The fire (love) cannot be put out (extinguished) even if there was a flood of water (outside circumstances which may alter a person's feelings) poured on it. She is saying that the love they share cannot be stopped or changed by outward events. (See: Hyperbole) (See: Metaphor)
  * **the offer would utterly be despised. **- The man who thinks he can "buy" love by offering wealth to a woman will be disappointed because love can only be freely given.
