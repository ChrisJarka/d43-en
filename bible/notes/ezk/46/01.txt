\v 2 The king must enter the courtyard through the entry room of the gateway, and stand alongside the gatepost. Then the priests must sacrifice the animal that will be completely burned \add on the altar\add*, and also his offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh.

\v 1 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: The gate of the inner court, facing east, will be shut for the six days of work, but on the Sabbath it will be opened and on the day of the new moon it will be opened.
\v 2 The chief will enter by the way of the gate porch from outside, and he will stand before the doorposts of the gate while the priests perform his burnt offering and his peace offering. Then he will worship at the threshold of the gate and go out but the gate will not be shut until evening.
