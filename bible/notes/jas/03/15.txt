\v 15 Those who have such attitudes are not wise in the way that God wants them to be. Instead, they are only thinking and acting like ungodly people. They think and act according to their own evil desires. They do what the demons want them to do.
\v 16 Keep in mind that people who have such attitudes are unruly.They selfishly take from other people and act like what they are doing is right, but it is wrong, and they practice every sort of evil.
\v 17 But when people are wise in the way that God wants them to be, they are pure, which God considers to be very important. They also act peaceably towards others, they are considerate of others, they are willing to yield to the wishes of others, they act compassionately toward others, and they do all kinds of good things
for others. How they treat others does not depend on others' status, and they are sincere in all they do.
\v 18 Those who act peaceably toward others cause the others to also act peaceably, with the result that they all live together acting righteously .

\v 15 This is not a wisdom that comes down from above, but instead is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
\v 16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is confusion and every vile practice.
\v 17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, warm-hearted, full of mercy and good fruit, without favoring certain people, and sincere.
\v 18 And the fruit of righteousness is planted in peace for those who make peace.
