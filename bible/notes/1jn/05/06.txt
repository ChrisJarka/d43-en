\v 6  Think about Jesus Christ. He is the one who came  to earth from God. God showed that he had truly sent Jesus when John baptized Jesus in water, but also when Jesus' blood flowed from his body when he died. And God's Spirit declares  truthfully that Jesus Christ came from God.
\v 7 These three things are like three people who are witnesses:
\v 8  God's Spirit, the water when John baptized Jesus, and  Jesus' blood that flowed from his body when he died on the cross. These three things all tell us the same thing, that Jesus came from God.

<usfm>
\v 6 This is he who came by water and blood, that is, Jesus Christ. He came not only by water, but by water and blood.
\v 7 For there are three who bear witness:
\v 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three agree in one.
\f + \ft The best ancient copies omit the following text: "the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit." \fqa  \f*

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **This is he who came by water and blood, that is, Jesus Christ** - "Jesus Christ is the one who came by water and blood. "Here "water" refers to the baptism of Jesus. Also "blood" refers to Jesus' death on the cross. AT: "God showed that Jesus Christ is his son at Jesus' baptism and his death on the cross." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **not only by water, but by water and blood** - AT: "God did not just show us Jesus was his son through his baptism, but through his baptism and his death on the cross."
