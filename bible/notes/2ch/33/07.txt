\v 7 The carved figure which he had made, he set in the temple about which Yahweh said to David and to Solomon his son, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever.
\v 8 I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their ancestors, if they will only be careful to act according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the Law that my servant Moses commanded them."
\v 9 Manasseh tempted them to do what was evil even more than the nations that Yahweh had destroyed before the children of Israel.
