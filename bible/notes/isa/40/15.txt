\v 15 Look, the nations are as a drop in the bucket, and are regarded as the  dust on the scales: see, he weighs
the isles as a speck.
\v 16  Lebanon is not sufficient fuel, nor its wild animals sufficient for a burnt-offering.
\v 17 All the nations are insufficient before him; they are regarded by him nothing.
