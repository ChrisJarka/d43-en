==== Description ====

The ULB and UDB use ellipsis marks, long dashes, parentheses, and indentation to show how information in the text is related to what is around it. \\ 

===Ellipsis marks===

Ellipsis marks (...) are used to show that either someone did not finish a sentence they started, or that the author did not quote all of what someone said.

In Matthew 9, the ellipsis mark shows that Jesus did not finish what he was saying to the scribes when he turned his attention to the paralyzed man and spoke to him. 
>Behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, "This man is blaspheming."Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why are you thinking evil in your hearts? For which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,..." he said to the paralytic, "Get up, pick up your mat, and go to your house."  (Matthew 9:4-6 ULB)

In Mark 11 The ellipsis mark shows that either the religious leaders did not finish their sentence, or Mark did not finish writing what they said.

>They discussed between themselves and argued and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' But if we say, 'From men,' ..." They feared the people, for they all held that John was a prophet. Then they answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." Then Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." (Mark 11:31-33)


===Long Dashes=== 
Long dashes introduce information that is immediately relevant to what came before it. (We have underlined that information in the example below.)

>Then two men will be in a field__—one will be taken, and one will be left behind.__ Two women will be grinding with a mill__—one will be taken, and one will be left__. Therefore be on your guard, for you do not know on what day your Lord will come. (Matthew 24:40-41 ULB)

===Parentheses=== 
 
Parentheses are used to show that some information is an explanation or afterthought. It does not contribute as well as the material around it to the point of the passage. (We have underlined that information in the examples below.)

In verse John 6:6, John he interrupted the story he was writing to explain that Jesus already knew what he was going to do. This is put in parentheses.

><sup>5</sup>When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming to him, he said to Philip, "Where are we going to buy bread so that these may eat?" <sup>6</sup>__(Now Jesus said this to test Philip, for he himself knew what he was going to do.)__<sup>7</sup>Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be sufficient for each one to have even a little." (John 6:5-7 ULB)

In Matthew 24:4-51 quoted what Jesus was saying. The words in the parentheses below are not what Jesus was saying, but what Matthew was saying to the reader. 

>Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place __(let the reader understand)__, let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out anything that is in his house, 18and let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak.  (Matthew 24:15-18 ULB)

=== Indentation===
 
When text is indented, it means that the line of text starts further to the right than the lines of the text above and below it that are not indented. This is done for 1) poetic lines, 2) some long quotations, and 3) some lists. 

The lines in poetry are indented.
><sup>1</sup>Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked,
>or stand in the pathway with sinners,
>or sit in the assembly of mockers.
><sup>2</sup>But his delight is in the law of Yahweh,
>and on his law he meditates day and night. (Psalm 1:1-2 ULB)


Sometimes a whole paragraphs is indented to show that it is quoted. Verse 6 below is a quote from the Old Testament, and it is indented to the right in the ULB.

><sup>4</sup>Herod brought together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and he asked them, "Where is the Christ to be born?" <sup>5</sup> They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what was written by the prophet,\\ 
>><sup>6</sup>'And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
>>are not the least among the leaders of Judah,
>>for from you will come a ruler
>>who will shepherd my people Israel.'"\\ 
><sup>7</sup>Then Herod secretly called the learned men to ask them exactly what time the star had appeared. (Matthew 2:4-7 ULB)


Indentation is also used in some lists when each item in the list has a lot of information.

><sup>5</sup>These are the names of the leaders who must fight with you:
>          From the tribe of Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur;
><sup>6</sup>from the tribe of Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai;
><sup>7</sup>from the tribe of Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab;
><sup>8</sup>from the tribe of Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar;
><sup>9</sup>from the tribe of Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon;
><sup>10</sup>from the tribe of Ephraim son of Joseph, Elishama son of Ammihud;
>          from the tribe of Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur;
><sup>11</sup>from the tribe of Benjamin son of Joseph, Abidan son of Gideoni;
><sup>12</sup>from the tribe of Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai;
><sup>13</sup>from the tribe of Asher, Pagiel son of Ochran;
><sup>14</sup>from the tribe of Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel;
><sup>15</sup>and from the tribe of Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan. (Numbers 1:5-15 ULB)
