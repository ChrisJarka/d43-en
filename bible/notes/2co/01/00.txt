He thanks God for his grace to them and making them rich in speech and spiritual gifts.

**Paul's Defense**

Paul said he was sincere in his plan to visit them even though it did not work out. He mentions the trouble he had in the Provence of Asia was so bad that they did not expect to live through it. He had been wanting to visit them twice, once before going to Macedonia and again on the way from Macedonia to Jerusalem. He had not said he would come when he really planned not to come but he postponed his visit so as not to want to hurt them disciplining them.
