\v 16 You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars in the heavens; but they are like locusts: they plunder the land and then fly away.
\v 17 Your princes are as many as the locusts, and your generals are like grasshopper swarms, that camp in the walls on a cold dayâ€”but when the sun rises they fly away to no one knows where.
