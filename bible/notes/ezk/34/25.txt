\v 25 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell
securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
\v 26 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its
season; there shall be showers of blessing.
\v 27 And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in
their land; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of
the hand of those that made bondmen of them.
