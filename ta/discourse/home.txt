"The Discourse Function of kai egeneto in Luke and Acts" by JoAnn Marie Gault in Journal of Translation and Text Linguistics describes Luke's uses of kai egeneto and egeneto de to mark the beginning of an episode and certain events within an episode, and she tells how he used one differently from the other. 

In her final paragraph she says not to ignore these two markers, but she also warns about translating them as "It came to pass" since that's not normal English, and "it happened that" since in English that connotes 'happenstance'. 


My concern is that the gateway translators and the MTTs might not understand this and might try to translate these expressions literally. I think  it would be good for the TN team  to write context specific notes like the following:

*  This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new episode. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
*  This phrase is used here to mark where the action starts.
*  This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the story.

(Unfortunately the underlined words above  are hers. I don't want to plagiarize, but those phrases are very clear.)

I expect that at first, the MTTs might not know what to do with that information. But after a while, they might realize that in their language they would do something special at those points in a narrative, such as putting in a certain word, or changing the word order, clause type, or aspect marking.

I don't know that I could confidently figure out why  kai egeneto or egeneto de is used each time it comes up in Luke (and certainly not in other books, because other authors could use them differently). But some of the others on the TN team may already have a good understanding of the structure of Luke and other narrative books. What would you think about me telling them about this and asking them to write the notes?  If any are interested in this, do you know how they could have access to Gault's article?
