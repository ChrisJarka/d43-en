\v 15 For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Jehovah; and they shall come, and they shall
set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against
all the cities of Judah.
\v 16 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned
incense to other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
