This concludes David's last words.
  * **But the worthless will all be like thorns to be thrown away** - AT: "But the wicked person is worthless and dangerous like thorns that someone tries to throw away" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **because they cannot be gathered by one's hands** - AT: "because no one can pick them up with his hands without the thorns hurting him"
  * **They must be burned up where they lie** - AT: "The person must burn the thorns where they lie." This refers to God destroying wicked people.
