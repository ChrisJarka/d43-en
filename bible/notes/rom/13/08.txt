===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 8 Pay all of your debts when you are supposed to pay them. The only thing that is like a debt that you should never stop paying is to love one another. Whoever loves others has fulfilled all that God requires in his Law. \v 9 There are many things that God has commanded in his Law, such as do not commit adultery, do not murder anyone, do not steal, and do not desire anything that belongs to someone else. But we can sum up the meaning of all the Law in this sentence: "Love your neighbor as you love yourself." \v 10 If you love everyone around you, you will harm no one. So whoever loves others fulfills all that God's Law requires.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 8 Owe no one anything, except to love one another. For he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the Law. \v 9 For, "You will not commit adultery. You will not kill. You will not steal. You will not covet"—and if there is any other commandment also, it is summed up in this sentence: "You will love your neighbor as yourself." \v 10 Love does not harm one's neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfilment of the Law. </usfm>

  * **For he who loves**  - "The reason it is important to love other Christians, is because loving them helps them obey God's commands completely."

  * **You will not commit adultery**  - "You" is singular and refers to all people. (See: Forms of you)
  * **covet **  – to desire to have or possess something which a person does not have and is kept from having or possessing
