\v 21 So this is what Yahweh says to you: 'I will soon get rid of you. I will kill you, and I will also kill every male in your household, including those who are slaves and those who are not slaves.
\v 22 Your family will all be killed, just like the family of King Jeroboam and like the family of King Baasha were killed. I will get rid of you because you have caused me to become very angry, and you have also induced the Israelite people to sin.'

\v 21 Behold, I will bring evil upon you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him
that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel:

the provocation wherewith you have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.
