\v 26 Therefore, if they say to you, 'Look, the Christ is in the wilderness,' go not out to it; or, "See, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.
\v 27 For as the lightning shines forth from the East and is seen all the way to the West, so will be the coming of the Son of
Man.
\v 28 Wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.
