\c 104
\q
\v 1 Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
\q O Jehovah my God, you are very great;
\q You are clothed with honor and majesty:
\q
\v 2 Who coverest yourself with light as with a garment;
\q Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;
\q
\v 3 Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters;
\q Who makes the clouds his chariot;
\q Who walks upon the wings of the wind;
\q
\v 4 Who makes winds his messengers;
\q Flames of fire his ministers;
\q
\v 5 Who laid the foundations of the earth,
\q That it should not be moved for ever.
\q
\v 6 You coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture;
\q The waters stood above the mountains.
\q
\v 7 At your rebuke they fled;
\q At the voice of your thunder they hasted away
\q
\v 8 (The mountains rose, the valleys sank down)
\q To the place which you had founded for them.
\q
\v 9 You have set a bound that they may not pass over;
\q That they turn not again to cover the earth.
\q
\v 10 He sends forth springs into the valleys;
\q They run among the mountains;
\q
\v 11 They give drink to every beast of the field;
\q The wild asses quench their thirst.
\q
\v 12 By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation;
\q They sing among the branches.
\q
\v 13 He watereth the mountains from his chambers:
\q The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.
\q
\v 14 He causes the grass to grow for the cattle,
\q And herb for the service of man;
\q That he may bring forth food out of the earth,
\q
\v 15 And wine that makes glad the heart of man,
\q And oil to make his face to shine,
\q And bread that strengthens manâ€™s heart.
\q
\v 16 The trees of Jehovah are filled with moisture,
\q The cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;
\q
\v 17 Where the birds make their nests:
\q As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.
\q
\v 18 The high mountains are for the wild goats;
\q The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
\q
\v 19 He appointed the moon for seasons:
\q The sun knows his going down.
\q
\v 20 You make darkness, and it is night,
\q Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
\q
\v 21 The young lions roar after their prey,
\q And seek their food from God.
\q
\v 22 The sun ariseth, they get them away,
\q And lay them down in their dens.
\q
\v 23 Man goes forth to his work
\q And to his labor until the evening.
\q
\v 24 O Jehovah, how manifold are your works!
\q In wisdom have you made them all:
\q The earth is full of your riches.
\q
\v 25 Yonder is the sea, great and wide,
\q Wherein are things creeping innumerable,
\q Both small and great beasts.
\q
\v 26 There go the ships;
\q There is leviathan, whom you have formed to play therein.
\q
\v 27 These wait all for thee,
\q That you may give them their food in due season.
\q
\v 28 You give to them, they gather;
\q You open your hand, they are satisfied with good.
\q
\v 29 You hide your face, they are troubled;
\q You take away their breath, they die,
\q And return to their dust.
\q
\v 30 You send forth your Spirit, they are created;
\q And you renewest the face of the ground.
\q
\v 31 Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever;
\q Let Jehovah rejoice in his works:
\q
\v 32 Who looks on the earth, and it trembleth;
\q He touches the mountains, and they smoke.
\q
\v 33 I will sing to Jehovah as long as I live:
\q I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
\q
\v 34 Let my meditation be sweet to him:
\q I will rejoice in Jehovah.
\q
\v 35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth.
\q And let the wicked be no more.
\q Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
\q Praise you Jehovah.
