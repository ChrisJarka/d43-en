==== Description ====

Imperative sentences are mainly used to express a desire or requirement that someone do something. Sometimes imperative sentences are used in the Bible for other functions.

**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages would not use an imperative sentence for some of the functions that they are used for in the Bible.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

Speakers often use imperative sentences to tell or ask their listeners to do something. In Genesis 2, God spoke to Isaac and told him not to go to Egypt but to live where God would tell him to live.

> Now Yahweh appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land that I tell you to live in. (Genesis 26:2 ULB)

Sometimes imperative sentences are used in the Bible for other functions. 

=== Commands that do what they say=== 

God can cause things to happen by commanding that they happen. Jesus cleaned (healed) a man  by commanding that the man be clean (healed). They man could not obey the command, but Jesus caused him to be clean by commanding it.
> “I am willing. //Be clean//.” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. (Matthew 8:3 ULB)

In Genesis 1, God commanded that there should be light, and by commanding it, he caused it to exist.
>God said, "//Let there be light//," and there was light. (Genesis 1:3 ULB)

=== Imperative Sentences that Function as Conditions === 
An imperative sentence can also be used to tell the __condition__ under which something will happen.  The proverbs mainly tell about life and things that often happen. The purpose of Proverbs 4:6 below is no primarily to give a command, but to teach what people can expect to happen __if__ they love wisdom.

>do not abandon wisdom and she will watch over you; 
>love her and she will keep you safe. (Proverbs 4:6 ULB)

The purpose of Proverbs 22:6 below is teach what people can expect to happen __if__ they teach their children the way they should go. 

>Teach a child the way he should go,
>and when he is old he will not turn away from that instruction. (Proverbs 22:6 ULB)

==== Translation Strategies ====
  - If the function of an imperative sentence would not be understood correctly in your language, __use a sentence type__ that would express that function.
  - If the function of an imperative sentence would not be understood correctly in your language, __use a verb form__ that would express that function.
  - If the function of an imperative sentence would not be understood correctly in your language, __use pronouns__ that would make it clear.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ==== 

1. If people would not understand that the imperative sentence is used to  cause something to happen, use a statement that shows that instead.
  * ** Be clean.** (Matthew 8:3 ULB)
    * "You are now clean.
    * "I now cleanse you." 

2. If people would not understand that the imperative sentence is used to cause something to happen, use a statement that shows that instead.
  * **God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.**  (Genesis 1:3 ULB)
    * God said, "Let there be light," and there was light."
    * God //commanded that there be light//, and there was light"

The command below is used as a condition for what will happen, so it can be translated with the word "if."
>**Teach a child the way he should go,**
>**and when he is old he will not turn away from that instruction.** (Proverbs 22:6 ULB)

"//If// you teach a child the way he should go, \\ 
when he is old he will not turn away from that instruction."
