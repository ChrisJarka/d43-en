\c 39

\v 1 At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard
that he had been sick, and was recovered.
\v 2 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices,
and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house,
nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
\v 3 Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to
thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country to me, even from Babylon.
\v 4 Then said he, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is
nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
\v 5 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts:
\v 6 Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store until this
day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, says Jehovah.
\v 7 And of your sons that shall issue from thee, whom you shall beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
palace of the king of Babylon.
\v 8 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which you have spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be
peace and truth in my days.
