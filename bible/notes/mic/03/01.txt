\v 1 And I said, "Now listen,
\qYou leaders of Jacob,
\qAnd rulers of the house of Israel.
\qIs it not for you to know justice?
\q
\v 2 You who hate good
\qAnd love evil,
\qWho tear off their skin,
\qFlesh from their bones.
\q
\v 3 Who also eat the flesh of my people,
\qThey tear their skin off,
\qBreak their bones,
\qAnd chop them in pieces,
\qAs meat for the pot,
\qAs flesh in the cauldron.
