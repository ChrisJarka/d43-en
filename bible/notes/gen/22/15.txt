  * **this is an oracle of Yahweh**  - This is a formal way of saying that the words that follow come directly from Yahweh.
  * **By myself I have sworn**  - This can also be translated as "I have sworn and I am my witness." Yahweh said "by myself" to assure Abraham that he would do what he swore to do.
  * **you have done this thing**  - This can be translated as "you obeyed me"
  * **have not withheld**  - "have not kept back"
  * **your son, your only son**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:22:01|22:2]].

  * **as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore**  - These similes show the huge number of descendants that God would give Abraham. This can also be translated in a way that shows how the descendants would be like the stars and sand: "so that your descendants will be more than what people can count, just as the stars in sky and the sand on the seashore are more than what people can count" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:simile|Simile]])
  * **will possess the gate of their enemies**  - This is a metonym that means "will triumph over their enemies." Armies would break through the gate of their enemies' cities and conquer them. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])
