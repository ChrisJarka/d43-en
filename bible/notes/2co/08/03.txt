<usfm>
\v 3 \add I know that this is true\add*, because I have seen for myself that they not only gave \add money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* that they were able \add to give\add*, they gave \add so much money that they did\add* not even keep enough \add to buy what they needed for themselves\add*. Without anyone telling them \add to share their possessions\add*,
\v 4 they themselves kept requesting us to let them participate in what \add other believers\add* are doing in \add sending a gift of money to\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* God's people \add in Judea province\add*.
\v 5 I thought \add that they would give only a little of their money, but\add* they did much \add more than that\add*! First, they told the Lord \add Jesus\add* that they wanted to do \add what pleases him. After that, they told\add* me that they wanted to do \add whatever I thought was good for them to do, because they were sure that\add* would be what God \add wanted them to do\add*.

\v 3 They gave as much as they were able—and I testify it is true—and some sacrificed and gave so much they suffered need themselves, but they still gave. They wanted to give,
\v 4 and they begged us over and over and they pleaded with us so they could give to this collection, so they be part of this  ministry lead by the people God had set apart for himself.
\v 5 Their desire to help was unexpected, but because they had given themselves first to the Lord, they knew it was God's desire to help, and so they gave not only money, they gave themselves.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 For they gave as much as they were able, I bear witness, even beyond what they were able. And of their own free will
\v 4 with much begging they pleaded with us for the gift of sharing in this ministry to the saints.
\v 5 And this was not as we had expected, but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and then, by the will of God, to us.
