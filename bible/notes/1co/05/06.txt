\v 6 It is not good that, \add while you are letting that immoral man continue to be in your congregation\add*, you are boasting  \add about being spiritually mature\add*. You know that a small amount of yeast affects all the bread dough \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add into which it is put\add* \f + \ft Or:\add a woman puts it\add* \f*.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that a small amount of yeast affects all the bread dough ( metaphor ) \add into which it is put\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Similarly, one person who continues to sin will have a bad effect on all the congregation\add*.
\v 7 So, \add just like we Jews\add* expel the old yeast  \add from our houses during the Passover celebration\add* in order that we may have a fresh batch of dough without yeast in it \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add you must expel such evil people from your congregation\add*. Do  \add that so that you can truly be holy people\add*, as  \add I know that\add* you really are. Remember that Christ was sacrificed \f + \ft Or:sacrificed himself \f* \add so that God could spare us from being punished for our sins, just like the Jews sacrificed lambs during\add* the  \add first\add* Passover celebration  \add so that God would spare their firstborn sons from being killed\add*.
\v 8 So let us celebrate  \add the fact that God has freed us from punishing us for our sins\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like the Jews\add* in  \add later years\add* celebrated Passover  \add to celebrate God freeing them from being slaves in Egypt. They made sure that there was\add* no old yeast in the dough. \add They ate bread that\add* had no yeast in it. \add Similarly\add*, \add we should make sure that there are no people in our congregations\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add who act\add* maliciously  \add toward others\add* or  \add act\add* wickedly. Instead, \add make sure\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that those in our congregations are ones who act\add* sincerely and  \add speak\add* truthfully.

\v 6 Your glorying is not good. Do you not know that a little yeast leaveneth the whole lump?
\v 7 Purge out the old yeast that you may be a new lump seeing that you are unleavened. For even Christ, our passover has been sacrificed 
\v 8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
