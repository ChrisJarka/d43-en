    * **Who are these who fly along like a cloud, and like the doves to their shelters?** - Yahweh uses questions to emphasize that people are even traveling over the sea to find him. He compares the sails of the ships to clouds and doves. AT: "Look, I see something like clouds moving quickly and like doves looking for shelter."
