Verses 15 and 16 tell more about the animals that were listed in verse 14.

  * **in which was the breath of life**  - The phrase “in which was the breath of life” is a figurative way of saying “that lived.” (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy]])
  * **flesh in which was the breath of life**  - This refers primarily to land animals.
  * **male and female of all flesh**  - This could be translated as "male and female of every kind of animal."
  * **after them**  - This could be made more explicit: "after they entered the ark" (See: [[:en:ta:discourse:implicitexplicit]]).
