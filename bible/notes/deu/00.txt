**What is Deuteronomy about?**\\

The name “Deuteronomy” is taken from the Greek language and means “Second Law” because this is the second time Moses was records the law. (Covenant renewal) This book records the renewal of the [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenant]] with Moses and reminds the Israelites of what God had done for them and what he expected from them. He warned them against idolatry and the danger of abandoning their faith in Yahweh.  Yahweh promised judgment on those who disobeyed, and blessings on those who obey his Law. 

**Who wrote Deuteronomy?**\\

The Bible tells us that Moses composed the book of Deuteronomy. The writers of both the Old and New Testament confirm his part in the composition of the book of Deuteronomy. However, it is widely assumed that Chapter 34 and the matters dealing with Moses’ death or events occurring after Moses’ death were compiled or written by Joshua.

**What are the different parts of Deuteronomy?**\\ 

In the first four chapters Moses encourages the Israelites to obey the laws of God after reminding them of the Exodus and their journey of the wilderness. 

From chapter 5 through 28, Moses repeats the Ten Commandments to the Israelites and gives details about the meaning of the law and the importance of obeying the law, as well as putting God first as his chosen people. He promised Yahweh’s blessings on those who obey and his judgment on those who disobey. 

In the last chapters, Moses blesses the tribes of Israel and appoints Joshua as his successor. Before he dies, God also shows him the promise land, although he is not allowed to enter it.



The book is a series of speeches by Moses to Israel as they prepare to live in the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]] without Him.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**Does Deuteronomy give instructions for a "holy war?" (Deuteronomy 7,20)**\\ Reword 
In preparation of the conquest of the Promised Land, God gave specific instructions to completely destroy the people and livestock of the peoples they conquered in Canaan. The Israelites were used by God to enact punishment for him, it can therefore be seen as God's war. In Deuteronomy, holy war is not glorified but is seen as a last resort and to be done humanely.

**Were the religious laws in Deuteronomy different than the laws put in place by the government?**\\

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**Why does the author frequently use the word "today?"**\\
The author repeatedly uses the word "today" (ULB), while some English translations use "this day." This gives the reader the impression that these speeches were all given on the same day. This may have caused the reader to view this as Moses's will.

**What is the role of God's [[:en:obe:kt:name|name]] in Deuteronomy?**\\
God's name is mentioned over 30 times in the book of Deuteronomy. While there are many ways to understand this [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|metonomy]], it commonly references God's reputation or fame. In Deuteronomy, it is often part of a construction indicating a place where God's name will [[:en:obe:kt:life|live]] or be placed.  This is a reference to Jerusalem and likely references Israel's role in bringing the knowledge of Yahweh to the world.
