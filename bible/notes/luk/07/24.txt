\v 24 When the men whom John had sent left, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said, "What did you go into the wilderness to see? A thin stalk of a plant shaken by the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see? A man in fancy clothing? Look, those who wear splendid clothes and who have the best of everything live in kings' palaces.
\v 26 Then what did you go out there to see? A prophet? Yes! But I tell you that John is more important than an ordinary prophet.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **a reed shaken by the wind - **  reeds are a water plant that, when they die, leave a hollow rigid stalk sticking up out of the water or swampy area. When the wind blows through the dead reeds, they make a lot of noise, but are very fragile and fairly useless. A reed is a frequent metaphor for a useless person, or false hope. Something that is all noise, and no action.
    * **shaken**-can also mean disturb or drive away through pressure of others.
    * **a man dressed in soft clothes**- that is, "a human being robed in fancy, soft, or effeminate clothes," such as a celebrity might do.
