<usfm>
\v 15 God considers that you killed Jesus, the one who gives people eternal life. But God has caused him to become alive again. We saw Jesus many times after he became alive again.
\v 16 It is because we trust in Jesus and this man trusts in Jesus that he is made strong again and able to walk in front of you all."

\v 15 You killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the deadâ€”and we are witnesses of this.
