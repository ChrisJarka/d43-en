\c 3
\p
\v 1 If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of
God.
\v 2 Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth.
\v 3 For you died, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
\v 4 When Christ, who is our life, shall be manifested, then shall you also with him be manifested in glory.
\b
\p
\v 5 Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and
covetousness, which is idolatry;
\v 6 for which things’ sake comes the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience:
\v 7 wherein you also once walked, when you lived in these things;
\v 8 but now do you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth:
\v 9 lie not one to another; seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,
\v 10 and have put on the new man, that is being renewed to knowledge after the image of him that created him:
\v 11 where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ
is all, and in all.
\p
\v 12 Put on therefore, as God’s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering;
\v 13 forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you,
so also do ye:
\v 14 and above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.
\v 15 And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also you were called in one body; and be you thankful.
\v 16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms
and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.
\v 17 And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father
through him.
\p
\v 18 Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
\v 19 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.
\v 20 Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.
\v 21 Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged.
\v 22 Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers,
but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord:
\v 23 whatever you do, work heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men;
\v 24 knowing that from the Lord you shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: you serve the Lord Christ.
\v 25 For he that does wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he has done: and there is no respect of persons.
