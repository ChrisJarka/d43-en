===== Description =====

In all languages, most metaphors fall into broad patterns of associations between ideas. The patterns of associations found in the Bible are often unique to the Hebrew and Greek languages. It is useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems on how to translate them. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere.

After becoming familiar with these patterns, translators will see that many **similes** in the Bible are built on these same associations of ideas. 

These patterns of associating one idea with another present three challenges to anyone who wants to identify them:

(1) The surface manifestations of most Biblical metaphors usually obscure their underlying structures. For example, it may not be immediately obvious that the expression //It is God who puts strength on me like a belt// Ps. 18:32 (ULB) is authorized by the pattern CLOTHING IS MORAL QUALITY (see no. 4 below).

(2) As with all language, the context, i.e., the surrounding text or “co-text,” must determine the sense of an expression. Thus, for example, whether “lamp” refers concretely to a container with oil and a wick for giving light, or whether it refers instead to the notion of life (see LAMP OR FIRE IS LIFE below), depends on the context.

(3) Expressions that are authorized by these conceptual associations frequently combine together in complex ways. Moreover, they frequently combine with—and in some cases are based on—common metonymies (see Part Two below) and cultural models (see Part Three below).


The following pages have lists of some of the ideas that are associated with each other in the Bible, together with examples of them from the Bible. They are organized by semantic domain of the images:
