\v 15 Later Johanan talked with Gedaliah privately. He said, "Allow me to go and murder Ishmael secretly. It would not be good \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* to allow him to come and murder you! If you are killed, what will happen to all the Jews who have returned to this area? They will be scattered, and the other people who remain in Judah will all be killed!"
\p
\v 16 But Gedaliah said to Johanan, "No, I will not allow you to do that. I think that you are lying about Ishmael."

\v 15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will kill
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he take your life, that all the Jews that are gathered
to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?
\v 16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing; for you speak
falsely of Ishmael.
