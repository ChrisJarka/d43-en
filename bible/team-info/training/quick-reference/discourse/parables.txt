====== Parables ======


===== Description =====

Concepts translated as "parable" include narrative stories, metaphors, similes, proverbs and even riddles. When you encounter a parable, know that the intent is to convey meaning through a story or word picture. A parable is not an actual account of an event; it is more like an imaginary example (e.g. This could happen).
