\v 11 The king of Assyria commanded that the people of Israel be taken to Assyria. Some of them were taken to Halah \add town\add*, some were taken to a place near the Habor \add River\add* in the Gozan \add region\add*, and some were taken to cities where the Mede people-group live.
\v 12 That happened because the Israelites did not obey Yahweh their God. They disobeyed the agreement that Yahweh had made with their ancestors, and all the laws that Moses, the man who served Yahweh \add very well\add*, had told them to obey. They would not obey those laws; they would not even listen to them.

\v 11 And the king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan,
and in the cities of the Medes,
\v 12 because they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of
Jehovah commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.
