\c 17
\q
\v 1 My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct,
\q The grave is ready for me.
\q
\v 2 Surely there are mockers with me,
\q And mine eye lives upon their provocation.
\b
\q
\v 3 Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself;
\q Who is there that will strike hands with me?
\q
\v 4 For you have hid their heart from understanding:
\q Therefore shall you not exalt them.
\q
\v 5 He that denounceth his friends for a prey,
\q Even the eyes of his children shall fail.
\b
\q
\v 6 But he has made me a byword of the people;
\q And they spit in my face.
\q
\v 7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow,
\q And all my members are as a shadow.
\q
\v 8 Upright men shall be astonished at this,
\q And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.
\q
\v 9 Yet shall the righteous hold on his way,
\q And he that has clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.
\q
\v 10 But as for you all, come on now again;
\q And I shall not find a wise man among you.
\q
\v 11 My days are past, my purposes are broken off,
\q Even the thoughts of my heart.
\q
\v 12 They change the night into day:
\q The light, say they, is near to the darkness.
\q
\v 13 If I look for Sheol as my house;
\q If I have spread my couch in the darkness;
\q
\v 14 If I have said to corruption, You are my father;
\q To the worm, You are my mother, and my sister;
\q
\v 15 Where then is my hope?
\q And as for my hope, who shall see it?
\q
\v 16 It shall go down to the bars of Sheol,
\q When once there is rest in the dust.
