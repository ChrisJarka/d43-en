===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Judah will live forever... Jerusalem will live from generation to generation** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing.  This is poetic language used in war. The victory for people of Israel is compared to the enemies who were destroyed in [[en:bible:notes:jol:03:18|3:19]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **I will avenge their blood that I have not yet avenged**  - Yahweh will punish all those who killed his people; no guilty person will escape punishment.
