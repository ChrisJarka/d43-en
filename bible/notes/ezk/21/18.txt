\v 18 The word of Jehovah came to me again, saying,
\v 19 Also, you son of man, appoint you two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall come forth
out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.
\v 20 You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the
fortified.
