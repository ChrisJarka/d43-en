\v 18 We have sent Titus along with another Christian brother. This brother has a good reputation among the churches and also he has much experience in proclaiming the Good News.
\v 19 This brother was selected by the churches to travel with us as we carry this offering from the churches and bring it to you. We hope the Lord would be honored by what he is doing through this gift, and the Lord is making himself known through this offering, and giving us an opportunity to show to everyone how great our desire is to help other people, especially other Christians.
