===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:other:heart]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:bride]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The man continues to speak to the woman.

  * **You have stolen my heart** - Possible meanings of this idiom are 1) "My heart now belongs completely to you" or 2) "I strongly desire to make love to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my sister** - This is an idiom of affection. They are not actually brother and sister. AT: "my dear" or "my darling" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my bride** - This Hebrew word can refer to a woman who is married or to one whom a man has arranged to become his son's wife. If your language has a polite word that a man would use to his wife and that has not been used yet in this book, you could use it here. Otherwise you could use any polite term a man would use with his wife. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:04:08|4:8]].
  * **heart, with just one look at me, with just one jewel** - "heart. All you have to do is look at me once or show me just one jewel." Both the woman's eyes and her jewelry attract the man to her.
  * **necklace** - This necklace probably went around her neck many times (See: [[:en:bible:notes:sng:04:04|4:4]]).
