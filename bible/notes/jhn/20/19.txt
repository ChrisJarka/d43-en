\v 19 When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day
of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the

\v 20 And when he had said this, he showed to them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw
the Lord.
