<usfm>
\v6 For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as
a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
\v 7 And there is none that calls upon your name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for you have hid your face
from us, and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.
