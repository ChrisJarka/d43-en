<usfm>
\v 4 For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;
\v 5 and spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
\v 6 and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made them an example to those that should live ungodly;
