====== Inclusive ======

Some languages have two sets of pronouns for “we” “us” and “our”. The inclusive pronouns refer to the speaker and the person(s) he (or she) is talking to (and possibly others as well). These pronouns are called “inclusive” because, in addition to the speaker, they include the person being spoken to.

Not all languages have “inclusive” pronouns. But translators whose language has separate inclusive pronouns will always have to be careful whenever they read words like “we” “us” and “ours.” in English, Hebrew, or Greek. They will always have to figure out whether they should use the pronoun that includes the person being spoken to or the pronoun that excludes the person being spoken to.
