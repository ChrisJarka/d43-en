===== Translation Notes: =====
God warms the people of Israel about the coming locust army.
  * **you drunkards** This refers to the nation of Israel. Alternate translation: "senseless or unconcerned people." (See:[[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **you drunkards, and weep!
Wail, all you drinkers of wine** -  In this phrase, "drunkards...weep" and "Wail...drinkers of wine" mean the same thing. It is written twice to show how the people of Israel care more for wine than God and will cry in sorrow as they are judged by God. Alternate translation: "you people who love wine should cry out in sorrow about what is about to happen" (See:[[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
  * **nation** - This "nation" is referring to the locust swarm.(See:[[en:ta:translate:personification]])
  * **my land** - This refers to the nation of Israel. Alternate translation: "the nation of Israel" or "the land of Yahweh"(See:[[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **Strong and without number** - This refers back to "nation." It shows that the "nation" is both "strong" and "without number." This says basically the same thing. The "nation" is strong because of its numbers. Alternate translation: "the army is mighty with too many soldiers to count." (See:[[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
  * **His teeth are the teeth of a lion, And he has the teeth of a lioness** - The mouth of a locust looks like a lions teeth. They are however not actually lion or lioness' teeth. This is used to say the power of the locust is in its mouth as it eats and destroys plants. Alternate translation: "The locust mouth looks like a lion or lioness' mouth." (See:[[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **He has made my vineyard into a terrifying place**  - The vineyard refers to the land of Israel.  The land is terrifying due to the nation invading the land mentioned in 1:6. (See:[[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **made my vineyard into a terrifying place...stripped my fig tree bare...stripped its bark and thrown it away...branches are bare white** - This emphasizes the completeness of the destruction of Israel. It has eaten all the food on the vines and trees. Alternate translation: "all you ability to make wine or produce food is gone."  (See:[[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
