\v 24 Therefore I say to you, All things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you receive them, and you shall have
them.

forgive you your trespasses.
\v 26 \f + Many ancient authorities add v. 26 \fqa But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive
your trespasses.\f*
