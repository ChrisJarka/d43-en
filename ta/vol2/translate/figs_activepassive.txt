===== Active or Passive =====

This module answers the question: What does active or passive mean?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_grammar|Important Information about English Grammar]]

The English language has the active and passive forms of speech.\\
* In the **ACTIVE** form, the subject does the action and is always mentioned.\\
* In the **PASSIVE** form, the action is done to the subject and the one who does the action is //not always// mentioned.\\
Some languages have both the passive and active forms; however, the language does not use them in the same way.
===== Translation Suggestions =====
**Consider carefully how to best use the forms in your language before using the passive form wherever the English language does.**
   * Many languages do not have a passive form, only the active form exists. Therefore, it may be necessary to turn a sentence from the passive form into the active form.
  * To change a passive form to an active form it will be necessary to explain who did the action.
  * Consider why the passive form was used in the verse. There should be ways of achieving the same effect in the translation.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
Luke 3:9 //"Already the ax has been placed against the root of the trees. So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire"// \\ **every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down**  - This is a passive clause. It can be translated with an active clause “He chops down every tree that does not produce good fruit.”\\ 
\\ 
Luke 17:1-2 //Jesus said to his disciples, "It is certain that things that cause sin will come, but woe to him through whom they come! It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble."// \\ **if a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown**  - This could also be translated with active clauses: “if they were to put a millstone around his neck and throw him” or “if someone were to put a heavy stone around his neck and push him.”
===== Examples from English =====
**Active**  - Peter built the house. **Passive**  - The house was built by Peter. \\ **Active**  - Worms ate the apple. **Passive**  - The apple was eaten by worms.
