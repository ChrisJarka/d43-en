\d For the Chief Musician. Maschil of the sons of Korah.
\q
\v 1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks,
\q So panteth my soul after thee, O God.
\q
\v 2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:
\q When shall I come and appear before God?
\q
\v 3 My tears have been my food day and night,
\q While they continually say to me, Where is your God?
\q
\v 4 These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me,
\q How I went with the throng, and led them to the house of God,
\q With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.
\q
\v 5 Why are you cast down, O my soul?
\q And why are you disquieted within me?
\q Hope you in God; for I shall yet praise him
\q For the help of his countenance.
\b
\q
\v 6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me:
\q Therefore do I remember you from the land of the Jordan,
\q And the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.
\q
\v 7 Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls:
\q All your waves and your billows are gone over me.
\q
\v 8 Yet Jehovah will command his lovingkindness in the day-time;
\q And in the night his song shall be with me,
\q Even a prayer to the God of my life.
\q
\v 9 I will say to God my rock, Why have you forgotten me?
\q Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
\q
\v 10 As with a sword in my bones, mine adversaries reproach me,
\q While they continually say to me, Where is your God?
\q
\v 11 Why are you cast down, O my soul?
\q And why are you disquieted within me?
\q Hope you in God; for I shall yet praise him,
\q Who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
