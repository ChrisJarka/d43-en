Perhaps the man \add giving the feast\add* has invited a man more important than you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add*.
\v 9 \add When that man comes\add*, the man who invited both of you will come to you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* and say to you, 'Let this man take your seat!' Then you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* will have to take the most undesirable seat, and you will be ashamed.

\p
\v 7 And he spoke a parable to those that were invited   , when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying to them,
\v 8 When you are commanded of any man to a marriage feast, sit not down in the chief seat; because a more honorable man than you may be commanded of him,
\v 9 and he that invited you and him shall come and say to you, Give this man place; and then you shall begin with shame to take the lowest place.
