====== Revelation 20 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is about a period of time often referred to as the "millennial kingdom" because it is a kingdom of a thousand years. This chapter is very significant for understanding the events of the [[:en:obe:kt:lastday|last days]] and the book of Revelation. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The thousand year reign of Christ ==
Jesus is said to reign for a thousand years and all the [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophecies]] in Scripture about worldwide peace will be fulfilled. Scholars are divided over whether this is an actual period of time or if it is an allegory for Christ beginning to reign in people's hearts. It is best to translate this as if Christ is physically reigning on earth for a thousand years and not attempt to input potential symbolism into the text.

== Final rebellion ==
This chapter describes a period of time after Jesus' reign, known as the final rebellion. During this time, Satan and many people will attempt to rebel against Jesus. This will be God's ultimate and final victory over [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] and [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]] and [[:en:obe:kt:eternity|eternity]] will begin.

== Great white throne ==

The is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]] for eternal life. Those possessing eternal life are said to have their names written in this Book of Life. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===
