\v 12 So now \add let me ask you this\add*: Since \add we\add* have all preached to you that Christ was raised again \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* caused Christ to become alive \f* after he died, no one among you should be saying that \add God\add* will not cause \add believers\add* to become alive again after they die!\f + \ft Or: why do some of you say that \add God\add* will not cause \add believers\add* to become alive again after they die? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 13 If \add it is true that God\add* will not cause anyone to become alive again, that situation would mean that Christ was not raised from the dead \f + \ft Or:\add he\add* did not cause Christ to become alive again \f*!
\v 14 And if Christ was not raised from the dead \f + \ft Or:if \add God\add* did not cause Christ to become alive again \f*, then what we preached to you was useless, and your believing \add in Christ\add* is useless.

\p
\v 12 Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you there is no resurrection of the dead?
\v 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised.
\v 14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, your faith also is in vain.
