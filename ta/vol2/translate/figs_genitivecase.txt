Genitive case shows the relationship between two nouns, when one noun is a part of/connected to/belongs to the second noun

==== Translation Suggestions ====

Genitive case can describe character, origin, possession, relationship, contents, or make up.  Make sure Your translation makes the relationship between the two nouns clear.  Ex: the love of Christ can mean the love Christ has or a person's love for Christ.  Be sure you understand the relationship of the nouns in the original and that your translation also makes that relationship clear.

==== Examples in the Bible ====

>But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the **kingdom of heaven**.  (Matt 19:14)

>And take the **helmet of salvation,** and the **sword of the Spirit**, which is the **word of God**  (Eph 6:17)

==== Examples in English ====

English shows the genitive case two ways: an of-phrase (with the possessor noun second) or with the possessive 's (with the possessor noun first).

Depending on the version of the Bible, nouns of possession may be translated with either the possessive 's (such as God's word) or with 'of' (such as word of God)
  * The man's office
  * The dog's tail
  * The color of the car
