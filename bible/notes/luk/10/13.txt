I did great miracles in your cities \add to show God's power, but you did not turn from your sinful behavior\add*. If the miracles that I performed in your \add cities\add* had been done in Tyre and Sidon \add cities\add*, the wicked people who lived there would have long ago \add shown that they were sorry for their sins by\add* sitting on the ground wearing coarse cloth and putting ashes on their heads.
\v 14 \add But they did not have the opportunity that you have, so when God punishes people, he will punish the wicked people who lived in\add* Tyre and Sidon, but he will punish you more severely \add because you did not pay attention to my message\add*!
\v 15 \add I also have something to say to\add* you\add people who live in\add* Capernaum \add city\add*. Do not \add think that you will be honored\add* \f + \ft Or:\add that God\add* will honor you \f* in heaven!\f + \ft Or: Do you \add think that you will be honored\add* \f + \ft Or:\add that God\add* will honor you \f* in heaven? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add That will not happen!

\v 13 How terrible it will be for you people who live in the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida, because you refuse to repent! If the miracles that I performed for you had been done in the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon, the wicked people who lived there would long ago have shown that they were sorry for their sins by sitting on the ground wearing coarse cloth and putting ashes on their heads.
\v 14 So on the final day when God judges everyone, he will punish you more severely than the wicked people who lived in Tyre and Sidon because you did not  believe even though you saw me do miracles!
\v 15 I also have something to say to you people who live in the city of Capernaum. Do you think you will be honored up in heaven? On the contrary, God will bring you down to the place of the dead!"

\v 13 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
\v 15 And you, Capernaum, do you think you will be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus continues to give directions to the 72 people he was sending out.)
    * **Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida**  - Jesus speaks as if the people of Chorazin and Bethsaida were there listening to him. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:apostrophe|Apostrophe]])
    * **sitting in sackcloth and ashes**- In ancient Middle Eastern custom, Israeli custom in particular, the wearing of sack-cloth like burlap (a kind of rough cloth used to make sacks to hold grain and produce), and the use of ashes on the head and sitting in them indicated extreme grief and sadness and was used to express mourning, humility, and/or grief for the bad things a person might have done.
    * **Hades**- In Hellenistic culture, Hades was both the name of the underworld where all the souls of the dead were sent for judgment to live out eternity in either paradise or torment, and it was the name of the Greek deity that controlled that underworld.
