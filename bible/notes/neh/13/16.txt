\v 16 There lived men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath to the
children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
\v 17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the
sabbath day?
\v 18 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yout you bring more wrath
upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
