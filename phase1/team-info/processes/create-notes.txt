====== How to Create Translation Notes ======

==== Formatting Notes ====

We have developed a general method for the format of the translation notes. We want the notes for all books to follow the same general pattern. See the links below for more information about formatting.

==== Reasons for translation notes: ====

There are many different situations where notes are necessary. These include:

  * Neither the UDB nor the tW page clarifies the meaning
  * There is implicit information that is not stated
  * English does not convey important information from the original languages
  * Some languages may not have the same syntactic structures as English
  * Idioms or figures of speech may not be understood
  * Cultural concepts and customs may not be understood
  * Different versions use different verse numbers, or include different text

==== List of Important Terms ====

The Important Terms section will have a list of the important terms in the ULB on that page. Each word will be linked to a Key Term page that explains it. Do not write anything in this section. If you think a word should be included, say so in the Discussion section. This page explains how we decide whether a term should have a page: [[:en:phase1:team-info:training:topics:kt-yes-no|Is It a Key Term?]]

==== Tidbits on Creating Notes ====

  * **When discussing pronouns**, it is important to identify the referents. This information assists the MTT to decide what pronoun form to use in their language. 
  * **Alternate Translation (AT:)** notes are used in conjunction with Translation Academy Topics (TA-Topics). If the translation does not address a TA-Topic, chances are that it is not an alternate translation suggestion but an equivalent phrase suggestion. 
  * **Overlapping information** from one note to another is acceptable. Unless the MTT reads both notes, such information will go unnoticed.
