\v 6 The \add leaders in Jerusalem\add*, whom your new teachers respect, did not add anything to what I preach. \add And I would add that\add* what status those leaders had did not influence me, because God does not favor certain\f + \ft Or: important \f* persons \f + \ft idiom \f* more than others.
\v 7 Instead of those leaders adding to the message that I tell people, they understood that I had been given the good message \f + \ft Or:God had given the good message to me \f* so that I might proclaim it to the non-Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*, just like \add God\add* had given the good message to Peter so that he might tell it to those who are Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 8 That is, just like \add God\add* had empowered\f + \ft Or: authorized \f* Peter in order that he might be an apostle \add to bring God's message\add* to the Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*, he also had empowered\f + \ft Or: authorized \f* me in order that I might be an apostle to \add bring his message to\add* the non-Jews.

\v 6 But from those who were reputable (whatever they were does not matter to me, God does not accept man’s
favortism)—they I say, who were of reputable contributed nothing to me,
\v 7 but contrariwise when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the gospel of the circumcision
\v 8 (for he who worked in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision worked in me also to the Gentiles),
