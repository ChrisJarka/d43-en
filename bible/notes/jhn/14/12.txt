\v 12 I am telling you the truth: whoever trusts in me will also do the things that I do. He will do even greater works because I am going to be with the Father.
\v 13 Whatever you ask in my name, that I will do. I will do this in order that everyone might honor the Father and that they might know the Father  because of everything that I, his Son, do.
\v 14 If you ask the Father for anything because you belong to me, I will do it.
