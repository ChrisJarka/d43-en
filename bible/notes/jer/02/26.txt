\v 26 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their
priests, and their prophets;
\v 27 who say to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back to
me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
\v 28 But where are your gods that you have made you? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for
according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.
