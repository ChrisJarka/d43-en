<usfm>
\q
\v 3 Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins,
\q All the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.
\q
\v 4 Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly;
\q They have set up their ensigns for signs.
\q
\v 5 They seemed as men that lifted up
\q Axes upon a thicket of trees.
\q
\v 6 And now all the carved work thereof
\q They break down with hatchet and hammers.
