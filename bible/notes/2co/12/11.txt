<usfm>
\v 11 It has been foolish for me \add to talk about myself like this\add*, but it is you who forced me to do it. Truly \add if the Lord would not help me\add*, I would be worthless, \add as my opponents say that I am\add*. But none of the men whom you \add wrongfully think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* are great apostles are greater in any way than I am. So it would have been right\f + \ft Or: proper \f* for you to say good things about me.
\v 12 \add You should have done that, because\add* when I was with you \add I\add* repeatedly did the things that showed you that \add I am truly\add* an apostle, such as performing many \f + \ft doublet \f* miracles.
\v 13 And I have \add certainly treated\add* you as well as \add I treated\add* the other congregations \add that I helped to start. Or do you think that\add* by not asking you \add to pay me for my work\add*, I was not treating you as well as I treated the other congregations? It is foolish for you to\add think that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add it\add* was wrong for me not \add to ask for pay from you for my work, and therefore I should ask\add* you to forgive me for that!\f + \ft Or: Do you \add think that it\add* was wrong for me not \add to ask for pay from you for my work, and therefore I should ask\add* you to forgive me for that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 11 When I write this way, I am praising myself and telling you what my life is like! But you need to know, for I have lived faithfully through all these trials, and I tell you this so you know that the "super-apostles" are not better than I, and I don't want to be better than anyone.
\v 12 Apostles can be identified by the power of their works—only they are not limited by anything if God permits them to show their power, or they can even defy the laws of nature in a wonder than others could never do, or they can show great power to prove they are doing the same kind of miracles that Christ did when he was on earth.
\v 13 How were you less important that all the churches? The only way you were different was that I didn't demand that you give me money like they did. Forgive me that I did not make you give me money when I served you!

\v 11 I have become a fool! You forced me to be, for I should have been commended by you, for I was not at all inferior to the "super-apostles," even though I am nothing.
\v 12 The true signs of an apostle were performed among you with all patience—signs and wonders and miracles.
\v 13 For how were you less important than the rest of the churches, except that I was not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!
