\v 29 I say that because I know that after I die, the people will become very wicked. They will turn away from doing all that I have commanded them to do.

\v 27 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yout alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against Jehovah; and how much more after my death?
\v 28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
\v 29 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because you will do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.
