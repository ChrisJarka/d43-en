====== Other Checking Methods ======

A number of other checking methods may also be used to ensure that the translation is easy to read and sounds natural to the listeners.

**Retell Method: ** A translator can read a few verses and ask someone else to retell what was said. This helps to check the clarity and naturalness of the translation and offers alternate ways of saying the same thing.

**Reading Method:** Someone other than the translator should read a portion of the translation while the translator notes where the pauses and mistakes occur.  This will show how easy or how difficult it is to read and understand the translation.
