\v 1-2 At that time there were still many people-groups in Canaan. Yahweh left there to test the Israelite people. But many of the Israelites in Canaan were younger people who had not fought in any of the wars in Canaan. So Yahweh also left those people-groups in Canaan so that the descendants of those who had not fought in any of the wars might learn how to fight.
\v 3 This is a list of the people-groups that Yahweh left there: The Philistines and their five leaders, the people living in the area near the city of Sidon, the descendants of Canaan, and the descendants of Hiv who were living in the mountains of Lebanon between Baalhermon Mountain and Lebohamath.

\v 1 Now these are the nations that Yahweh left, to test Israel by means of them, all the people of Israel who had not experienced the wars in Canaan,

nothing about itâ€”
\v 3 namely, the five kings of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites that
lived in in the mountains of Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the Lebo Hamath.
