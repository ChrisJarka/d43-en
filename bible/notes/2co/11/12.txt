===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 There are \add some men there among you\add* who would like to be able to say boastfully that they \add work among you\add* just as I do. So, in order to make it impossible \f + \ft idiom \f* \add for them to say that\add*, I have \add refused to accept pay from you\add*, and I will continue doing that.
\v 13 Those men are lying \add when they say that they are\add* apostles. They work deceitfully. \add Even though they say that they work for God, they are working only for themselves\add*. They try to make people think that Christ \add sent them\add* as his apostles, \add but they do not truly represent him\add*.

\v 12 The way I am living and serving you, I will continue to do, so that I may cut the ground out from under those who claim to be equal to us and who boast of their superiority. They will have no ground to stand upon.
\v 13 Such people are false messengers claiming to be sent from God, they are workers filled with lies, and they are impersonating the apostles of Christ.

\v 12 But what I am doing, I also will do, so that I might cut the ground from under the excuse of those who desire to be found equal to us in what they boast about.  
\v 13 For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
