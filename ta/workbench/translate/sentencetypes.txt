//This answers the question:// //What are the different types of sentences?//



==== Sentence Types ====

A **sentence** is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. The basic types of sentences are:
  * **Statement** - These are usually used to give information. '//This is a fact.//'
  * **Question** - These are usually used to ask for information. '//Do you know him?//'
  * **Exclamation** - These are usually used to express a strong feeling. 'Ouch, that hurt!'
  * **Command** - These are usually used to make something happen. '//Pick that up.//'


In some languages some of  these sentence types can be used for some of the purposes of the other types. For example, in some languages questions can also be used as a statement or an exclamation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
