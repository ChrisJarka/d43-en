\q 
\v 23 By your messengers you have defied the Lord, 
\q and have said, 'With the multitude of my chariots 
\q I have gone up to the height of the mountains, 
\q to the innermost parts of Lebanon, 
\q and I cut down the tall cedars and the choice pine trees there, 
\q and I entered into his farthest lodging place, 
\q the most fruitful forest.
\q 
\v 24 I have dug wells and have drunk foreign waters, 
\q and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.'
