\v 18 They said, "Remember\f + \ft Or: Think about \f* what Micah, \add the prophet\add* from Moresheth \add town\add*, prophesied during the years that Hezekiah was the king of Judah. He told the people of Judah this:
\q1 'This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says:
\q2 \add Some day\add* Zion \add Hill\add* will be plowed like fields \add are plowed\add*;
\q2 Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins.
\q1 There will be a large clump\f + \ft Or: group \f* of trees on top of the hill where the temple is now.'
\m
\v 19 But did \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* King Hezekiah or anyone else in Judah kill Micah \add for saying that\add*? No! Instead, Hezekiah revered Yahweh, and pleaded that he would act mercifully toward\f + \ft Or: not destroy \f* them. So, Yahweh changed his mind about sending to them the terrible disaster that he said he would send. And now \add if we kill Jeremiah\add*, we are going to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!"

\v 18 Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
\v 19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear Jehovah, and entreat the favor of Jehovah, and Jehovah repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus should we commit great evil against our own souls.
