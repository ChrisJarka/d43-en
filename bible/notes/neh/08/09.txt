\p
\v 9 And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said to all
the people, This day is holy to Jehovah your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of
the law.
\v 10 Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to him for whom nothing is
prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord: neither be you grieved; for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.
