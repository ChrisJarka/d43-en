===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **If Yahweh** - Verse 9 describes something that could have happened in the past but did not. (See: [[en:ta:translate:hypothetical]])
  * **Yahweh of Hosts **- "Yahweh, the Leader of the angel armies,"
  * **us...we** - Here these words refer to Isaiah and includes all the people of Judah and Jerusalem. (See: [[en:ta:translate:inclusive]])
  * **we would have been like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah **- Isaiah is comparing what could have happened to Judah to what actually happened to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. These cities were completely destroyed because they sinned against God. This could be translated as "we would have all been destroyed, like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed." (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
