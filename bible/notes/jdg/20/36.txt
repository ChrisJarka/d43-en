Then the main group of Israelite men retreated for a short distance, because they knew that the other Israelite men \add who had been hiding on the other side\add* of Gibeah would attack the people of the tribe of Benjamin by surprise. So \add after the main group of Israelite men retreated a little distance\add*, the men who had been hiding rushed out and ran into Gibeah and used their swords to kill everyone in the city. \add Then they started to burn the buildings\add*.

\p
\v 36 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they
trusted to the liers-in-wait whom they had set against Gibeah.
\v 37 And the liers-in-wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers-in-wait drew themselves along, and struck all the city
with the edge of the sword.
\v 38 Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers-in-wait was, that they should make a great cloud of smoke
rise up out of the city.
