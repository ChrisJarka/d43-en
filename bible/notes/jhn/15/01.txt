===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I am the true vine and my Father is the vinedresser. He takes away every branch in me that bears no fruit, and he cleans every branch that bears fruit so that it may bear more fruit.** - Jesus is using a familiar metaphor from the Old Testament that was used to describe the nation of Israel. In the metaphor, Jesus compares himself to a vine (which is the source of life) and people are compared to the branches which need to be connected to the vine. Those branches that are not connected to the vine are dead and are removed by the vinedresser (a person who prunes and tends to grape vines).   (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
