\c 4
\p
\v 1 And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with
the help of Jehovah.
\v 2 And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
\v 3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah.
\v 4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect to Abel and to
his offering:
\v 5 but to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
\v 6 And Jehovah said to Cain, Why are you wroth? and why is your countenance fallen?
\v 7 If you do well, shall it not be lifted up? and if you do not well, sin coucheth at the door: and to you shall
be its desire; but do you rule over it.
\v 8 And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his
brother, and killed him.
\p
\v 9 And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?
\v 10 And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.
\v 11 And now cursed are you from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand;
\v 12 when you till the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to you its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shall you
be in the earth.
\v 13 And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
\v 14 Behold, you have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from your face shall I be hid; and I shall be a
fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whoever finds me will kill me.
\v 15 And Jehovah said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah
appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should strike him.
\p
\v 16 And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and lived in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
\v 17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after
the name of his son, Enoch.
\v 18 And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad became the father of Mehujael; and Mehujael became the father of Methushael; and Methushael became the father of Lamech.
\v 19 And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
\v 20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and
have cattle.
\v 21 And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.
\v 22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of
Tubal-cain was Naamah.
\v 23 And Lamech said to his wives:
\q Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;
\q2 You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech:
\q For I have slain a man for wounding me,
\q2 And a young man for bruising me:
\q
\v 24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,
\q2 Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
\p
\v 25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For,
said she, God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain killed him.
\v 26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of
Jehovah.
