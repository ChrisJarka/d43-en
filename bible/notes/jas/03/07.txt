===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Although people are able to tame all kinds of wild animals, birds, reptiles and creatures that live in the water, and people have tamed them,
\v 8 no one is able to control what he says. The words we speak are an uncontrolled evil. Our words can do great harm, just like poison that kills.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 For every kind of wild animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind.
\v 8 But as for the tongue, no one among man is able to tame it. It is an uncontrollable evil, full of deadly poison.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For every kind of wild animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind** - The phrase "every kind" means "many kinds." This can be stated in active form. AT: "People have learned to control many kinds of wild animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **reptile** - This is an animal that crawls on the ground. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **sea creature** - This is an animal that lives in water.
  * **But as for the tongue, no one among man is able to tame it** - Here "tongue" refers to what a person says. The full meaning can be stated explicitly: "no person without God's help can control the tongue." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **restless evil, full of deadly poison** - This describes how people can use their spoken words to hurt someone. It can be translated as "like an evil creature that never sleeps and it is ready to attack." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
