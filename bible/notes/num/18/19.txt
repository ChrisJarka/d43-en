  * **Connecting Statement:** - God continues speaking to Aaron.

  * **All the presented offerings of holy things that the people of Israel offer to me** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "All the offerings of holy things that the people of Israel present and offer to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **a covenant of salt, a binding covenant forever** - The two phrases say much the same thing. The first emphasizes the second. AT: "an agreement forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
