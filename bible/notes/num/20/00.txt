== Moses' sin ==

God told Moses to command water to come out of a rock for the people who were complaining that they had no water. Moses became angry with the people and hit the rock twice. God told him that he and Aaron would not be allowed to go into Canaan because he disobeyed by hitting the rock instead of just speaking to it.
