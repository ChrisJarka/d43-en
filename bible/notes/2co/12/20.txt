\v 20 \add I have written this way to you\add* because I worry that when I come \add to visit you\add*, I will see that \add some of\add* you are \add not conducting your lives the way\add* that I want you \add to\add*. If that is so, \add when I get there\add* you will see that I will have \add to act\add* in a \add very severe way toward you, and I am sure\add* that you do not want that. Specifically, I am afraid that \add some of you\add* may be quarreling, or that you are being jealous \add of each other\add*, or that you quickly \add show others that you are\add* very angry \add with them\add*, or that you are acting selfishly, or that \add some of\add* you are saying bad things about others, or that you are spreading false rumors\f + \ft Or: saying false things \f* about each other, or that you are acting proudly, or that you are \add doing things\add* in a disorderly manner.
\v 21 \add I\add* \add feel anxious\f + \ft Or: am concerned\add* \f* \add about you. I worry that\add* when I visit you again, God, the one whom I \add serve\add*, will make me feel ashamed of you \add when I see that\add* you \add still are not conducting your lives as believers should\add*. Then I will feel very sad about \add some of\add* you who were sinning previously and have not turned from your sinful behavior. \add Some of you\add* may still have impure \add thoughts. Some of you\add* may be having sexual intercourse with those to whom you are not married. \add And some of you\add* may be doing other shameful things.

\v 20 But when I come to you, I may not find what I hope would be there. When I come you may not want to deal with me because of what I heard. I fear that you have many arguments going on in the your church, and people are jealous of one another, and there are terrible outbursts of anger between Christian's, and that some of you are putting yourselves first and you are serving yourselves and not each another, and that you are talking about one each other, and that there is too much selfishness. This means that everything in your church is out of order.
\v 21 When I come to you, I am afraid when I see you, God will break my heart and make me as nothing and he will humble me by what has been going on, when I see you. I am sad and mourn for many of you who sinned but did not repent. There were sexually immoral people who lived impure lives and they gave in to their lusts. For them my heart breaks with sadness.

\v 20 For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I wish, and that you might not find me as you wishâ€”that there may be arguments, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, gossip, pride, and disorder.
\v 21 I am afraid that when I come back, my God might humble me before you, and I might mourn for many of them that have sinned before now, and did not repent from the impurity and sexual immorality and lustful indulgence which they practiced.
