\v 1 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
\v 2 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
\v 3 And he says to the man that had his hand withered, Stand forth.
\v 4 And he says to them, Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? But they
held their peace.
\v 5 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he says to the
man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored.
\v 6 And the Pharisees went out, and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.
\p
\v 7 And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judaea,
\v 8 and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what
great things he did, came to him.
\v 9 And he spoke to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:
\v 10 for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him.
\v 11 And the unclean spirits, whenever they [*]saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, You are the Son of God.
\v 12 And he charged them much that they should not make him known.
\p
\v 13 And he goes up into the mountain, and calls to him whom he himself would; and they went to him.
\v 14 And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
\v 15 and to have authority to cast out demons:
\v 16 and Simon he surnamed Peter;
\v 17 and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of
thunder:
\v 18 and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the
son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,
\v 19 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
\p And he comes into a house.
\v 20 And the multitude comes together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
\v 21 And when his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
\v 22 And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons throws he out
the demons.
\v 23 And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
\v 24 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
\v 25 And if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
\v 26 And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.
\v 27 But no one can enter into the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong
man; and then he will spoil his house.
\v 28 Verily I say to you, All their sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and their blasphemies wherewith soever they
shall blaspheme:
\v 29 but whoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit has never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin:
\v 30 because they said, He has an unclean spirit.
\p
\v 31 And there come his mother and his brethren; and, standing without, they sent to him, calling him.
\v 32 And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say to him, Behold, your mother and your brethren without seek for thee.
\v 33 And he answereth them, and saith, Who is my mother and my brethren?
\v 34 And looking round on them that sat round about him, he saith, Behold, my mother and my brethren!
\v 35 For whoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
