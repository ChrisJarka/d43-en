==== Description ====

A metaphor occurs when someone speaks of something as if it were something else because there is something that they have in common. That is, in some way one is like the other. The speaker usually does this in order to help his audience understand what he is saying about that thing. 

>Jesus said to them. “I am the __bread of life__. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who trusts in me will never be thirsty." John 6:35 

Jesus called himself the bread of life. Bread is a food that people ate all the time then. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to trust in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.


=== Purposes of Metaphor ===

  * One purpose of metaphor is to teach about something that is unknown (the **topic**) by indicating that it is similar to something that is already known (the **image**).
  * Another purpose of metaphor is to emphasize that something has a particular quality or to indicate that it has that quality in an extreme way.
  * Another purpose of metaphor is to lead people to react emotionally to one thing as they would to another.
  * Often metaphors are the favorite way for speakers of any given language to talk about something. For example, when English speakers want to talk about increasing amounts of something, they often talk about something going up or down ("The literacy rate is going up." "The price of bread has gone down"). Many other languages require their speakers to say these things in other ways.

=== Translation Principles  ===


==== Examples from the Bible ====

>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. (John 10:11)

Jesus called himself the good shepherd. A good shepherd would save the lives of his sheep even if it would put his own life in danger. Jesus wanted to save his people and would die in order to do it.

>Produce fruits that are worthy of repentance,  (Luke 3:8)

People's behavior is called fruit. Trees can produce good fruit or bad fruit, and people can produce good behavior or bad behavior. Fruits that are worthy of repentance are good behavior that is appropriate for people who have repented.

>… __the rising sun will__  come from heaven to help us, __to shine__  on those who sit in __darkness__  and the __shadow of death__.  Luke 1:78b-79a

This verse has several related metaphors. The Savior is compared to the rising sun, teaching spiritual truth is compared to the sun shining, lacking spiritual truth is compared to sitting in darkness, and the fear of death is compared to a shadow. This means that just as the rising sun shines on those who have been living in darkness, the Savior will come and bring spiritual truth to those who lack spiritual truth and are afraid of death.


==== Translation Strategies ====
If people would understand the metaphor correctly, consider using it. If not, then here are some other strategies.


  - If the image in the original language is unknown to your people or is not used in the same way, it is often possible to use an image from your own culture. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. 
  - If the image in the original language is unknown to your people, it is often possible to simply state the truth that the original metaphor wanted to communicate. For example, "the children of Jerusalem" ([[en:bible:notes:luk:13:34]]) could be restated as "the people living in Jerusalem."
  - If the topic is not stated clearly in the original, and if it would also be unclear to your readers, state the topic clearly. However, do not do this if the topic was not clear to the original audience. For example, in Matthew 16:6, Jesus told his disciples "Beware of the __yeast__  of the Pharisees and Sadducees." His disciples thought he was talking about bread, but Jesus was warning them about the __teaching__  of the Pharisees and Sadducees. That was the topic, but it was unstated, and the disciples did not understand it at first. If the metaphor were fully stated, it would be, "The teaching of the Pharisees is like yeast." This sentence would communicate the fact that both teachings and yeast spread throughout whatever they touch and change it.
  - If the target audience would not understand the metaphor, then change the metaphor to a simile by adding "like" or "as."
  - If the biblical metaphor seems to be a normal way for the biblical language to say something, then ask yourself if people in your own language say it in the same way. If not, use the normal way that your language says it. For example, "[Stephen] fell asleep" (en:bible:notes:act:07:59) can be translated, "Stephen died."
