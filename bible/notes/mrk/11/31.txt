\v 31 They debated among themselves as to what they should answer. They said to each other, "If we say that it was God who authorized him, he will say to us, 'Then you should have believed what John said!'
\v 32 On the other hand, if we say that it was people who authorized John, then what will happen to us?" They were afraid to say that about John, because they knew that the people would be very angry with them. They knew that all the people truly believed that John was a prophet whom God had sent.
\v 33 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know who John got his authority from." Then Jesus said to them, "Because you did not answer my question, I will not tell you who authorized me to do those things here yesterday."

\v 31 They discussed between themselves and argued and said, "If we say, 'From heaven'—he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
\v 32 But if we say, 'From men'"—they feared the people, for they all held that John was a prophet.
\v 33 Then they answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." Then Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They discussed between themselves and argued... **  - The words "they and "themselves" refer to the religious leaders.  The word "argued" does not mean that there was a loud disagreement.  It means they considered different arguments as they discussed.  Alternate translation: "They discussed between themselves different ways to answer"
  * **If we say...he will say...not believe him**  - The word "we" refers to the religious leaders.  The word "he" refers to Jesus. The word "him" refers to John.
  * **But if we say, 'From men'"—they feared the people**  - The reason they do not say "From men" is because they fear the people turning against them. "The people" refer to the people who lived in Jerusalem and the surrounding country of Judea who had gone to see John in the desert. (See: Mark 1:5)(See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **they all held that John was a prophet** - "they all held to the belief that John was a prophet" or "they all believed that John was a prophet"
