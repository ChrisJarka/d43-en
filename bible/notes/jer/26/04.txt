\v 4-5 Say to them, 'This is what Yahweh says: I sent to you the prophets who serve me, to tell you what you should do. I sent them to you many times, but you have not paid attention to what they said. If you will not pay attention to what I say and do not obey the message that I have given to you, and if you do not pay attention to what the prophets say,
\v 6 I will destroy this temple like I destroyed Shiloh, \add the place where the Sacred Tent was put\add*. And I will cause Jerusalem to be a place whose name people in every nation on the earth will say when they curse someone.'~"

\v 4 So you will say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh: If you will not listen to me in order to walk in my Torah that I set before you,
\v 5 or listen to the words of my servants the prophets who I am sending out to you when I rise early and send them out—but you have not listened!—
\v 6 then I will make this house like Shiloh and this city into a curse to all the nations of the earth.’”
