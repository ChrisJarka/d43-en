===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **empty-handed**  - This means without carrying or bringing anything.
  * **buy back**
 - Firstborn sons and firstborn donkeys belonged to Yahweh, but Yahweh did not want them sacrificed to Him. Instead, the Israelites were to sacrifice a lamb in their place. This allowed the Israelites to "buy" the donkeys and sons from Yahweh.
