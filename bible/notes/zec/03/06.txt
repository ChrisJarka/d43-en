\v 6 Then the same angel said this to Joshua:
\v 7 "Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says that if you do what I want you to do and obey my instructions, you will be in charge of my temple and its courtyard. And I will allow you to be part of this group of angels who are always standing near to me and can speak with me at any time.

\v 6 Next the angel of Yahweh solemnly commanded Joshua and said,
\v 7 "Yahweh of hosts says this:
\q If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my commandments,
\q then you will govern my house and guard my courts,
\q for I will allow you to go and come among these who stand before me.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **solemnly commanded Joshua** - "commanded Joshua in a very serious manner" 
  * **If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my commandments** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Yahweh speaks of obeying him as if the person were walking along Yahweh's paths. AT: "If you will obey me and keep my commandments" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will govern my house and guard my courts** - Here the word "house" is a metonym for the temple, while "courts" refers to the courtyards around the temple. Together the phrases mean that Joshua will have authority over the whole temple complex. AT: "you will have authority over my temple and its courtyards" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **to go and come among these who stand before me** - The phrase "to go and come among" is an idiom that means that Joshua will be a part of this group and have the same privilege as they do of access to Yahweh. AT: "to come before me as these who stand here do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
