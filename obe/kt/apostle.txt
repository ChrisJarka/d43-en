====== apostle ======

===== Definition: =====

  * The apostles had the same authority as Jesus, who had sent them.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The word "apostle" can also be translated with a word or phrase that means, "someone who is sent out" or "sent out one" or "person who is called to go out and preach God's message to people."
  * It is important to translate the terms "apostle" and "disciple" in different ways from each other.
