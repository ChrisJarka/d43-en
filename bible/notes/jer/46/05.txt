\q
\v 5 Why have I seen this? They are filled with terror and are fleeing backward, for their warriors are scattered!
\q So they flee to a place of refuge and do not look back! Horror is all around!—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q
\v 6 The swift cannot flee! And the warrior cannot escape!
\q They stumble and fall towards the north against the strength of the Euphrates river.
