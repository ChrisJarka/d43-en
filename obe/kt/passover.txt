===== Facts: =====

The "Passover" is the name of a religious festival that the Jews celebrate every year, to remember how God rescued their ancestors the Israelites from slavery in Egypt.

  * The name of this festival comes from the fact that God "passed over" the houses of the Israelites and did not kill their sons when he killed the firstborn sons of the Egyptians and their livestock.
  * The Passover Feast includes a special meal that included a lamb without any defect that they killed, roasted, and shared, as well as bread made without yeast. These remind the Jews of the foods the Israelites ate that night before they escaped from Egypt.
