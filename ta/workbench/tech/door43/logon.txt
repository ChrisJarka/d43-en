When you are logged into your account you will be able to edit pages and participate in discussions. Three ways to know you are logged into your account:

  - Your name is at the top of the page. Your name will be at the top and the word "logout" will be on the far right at the top.
  - You will have the pencil icon on pages that you can edit.
  - You will see the discussion panel. (See #5 below for more information.)
