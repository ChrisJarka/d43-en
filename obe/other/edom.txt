====== Edom, Edomite, Idumea ======

===== Facts: =====

Edom was another name for Esau. The region where he lived also became known as "Edom." "The Edomites" were his descendants.

  * Edom was a mountainous region located to the south of Israel. Its territory changed over the years. During New Testament times, it was part of the region of southern Judah and was called "Idumea."
  * The word for Edom means "red," which may refer to the fact that Esau was covered with red hair when he was born. Or it may refer to the red lentil stew that Esau traded his birthright for.
  * In the Old Testament, the country of Edom is often mentioned as an enemy of Israel.
  * The entire book of Obadiah is about the destruction of Edom and other Old Testament prophets also spoke negative prophecies against Edom.
