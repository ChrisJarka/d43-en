\v 8 \add Some people say\add*, "It helps us in some ways if we exercise our bodies." But \add I say that\add* people benefit very much if they live in a godly way\f + \ft Or: in a way that pleases God \f*, because \add if people live in a godly way, that\add* will benefit them both while they live now and when they live in the future life \add in heaven\add*.

\v 6 Keep that truth before the brothers and sisters and you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ because you have been made strong by trustworthy words and the good teaching that you have come to follow.
\v 7 But, avoid what means nothing and the stories that only old women tell. Instead, exercise yourself to be godly,
\v 8 because physical exercise helps only a little, but godliness helps everything in this life and in the life to come.

\v 6 If you place this before the brethren, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ because you have been trained by the words of faith and by the good teaching that you have followed.
\v 7 But do not accept godless stories of old women, but train yourself in godliness.
\v 8 For bodily exercise is only a little useful, but godliness is profitable for all things and holds promise for this life now and the life to come.
