===== Writing Styles - Connecting Words =====

===== Description =====

Connecting words are words that link parts of a text to one another. These words help to organize what someone is saying or writing to show how their thoughts are related to each other and to the topic. Connecting words help the reader understand the text by showing how the speaker or writer is connecting his thoughts into a coherent message. 
Each language has its own patterns to show how thoughts are related and connected into a clear meaning. Specific words and phrases that join sentences or paragraphs together are important for connecting thoughts together for communicating clearly. 

Some other things that are important for clearly connecting the thoughts and meaning of a message include arranging the time order of the events into a sequence that accurately pictures what the writer desires the reader to understand. Also important for clarity and successfully communicating are things like describing what caused or causes something to happen, and then describing what has happened and the results of what has happened. Using an important word many times in a text helps readers and hearers understand more clearly, and also using words that are similar to the important words or substituting one word for another (like a pronoun for a noun) can help the meaning in a text be clearly understood.  

**Definition**: Connecting words are words that join two or more narratives or paragraphs or verses or sentences or clauses or phrases or words.
**Examples**: Examples of connecting words include: now, therefore, and, but, for, so, if, if only, since, then, when, while, whenever, because, yet, unless, like, and many more. In English, the simple joining of sentences is typically done with a conjunction. English also uses transition words or phrases such as: specifically, chiefly, in the beginning, following, in conclusion, to summarize, as a result, moreover.
**Purpose**: The purpose of connecting words is to show how a statement or groups of statements  are joined with other statements. How statements are connected clarifies the meaning intended by the writer or speaker by showing how his statements and words are related to each other.

=== Reason this could be a translation issue ===
Accurately understanding connecting words is important because their presence in the text and their meaning and purpose can be misunderstood and mistranslated. The meaning of connecting words is dependent upon the two thoughts that they are connecting. The thoughts that connecting words are connecting may be very long groups of sentences, or very short phrases or even just words, or anything in between. However, the meaning of the connecting words will depend upon the context created by what the writer is saying in the two texts that the connecting words are connecting.

=== Translation Strategies ===

If your language has a word that clearly translates the meaning of a connecting word found in the ULB, then consider translating with that word. These strategies below may help when your language cannot translate a connecting word found in the ULB.

1. Translators may need to use a connecting word even if the ULB does not use a connecting word. Use connecting words in your language that are natural and clear to your readers, as needed, even if the ULB does not use a connecting word. 
2. Translators do not need to use a connecting word just because the ULB does. Translators must be careful to use whatever words sound natural and communicates the intended meaning clearly and accurately in their language.
3. Translators must understand the meaning of the two thoughts that the writer is connecting with his use of a connecting word. The context created by the writer by the two thoughts he is connecting will be very important to the meaning of the connecting word that connects those thoughts.
4. Translators may seek to translate with the same connecting word in your language when the meaning is essentially the same, even if the ULB does not use a connecting word, or even if the ULB uses different connecting words for the same meaning. 
5. Translators may use different connecting words in your language when what is being said can be said in two different ways, but those ways mean the same thing.
