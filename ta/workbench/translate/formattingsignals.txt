====== ULB and UDB Formatting Signals ======

This module answers the question:  \\
In order to understand this module, it would be good to read 
  * [[link]]  (We need the bullet because of the app.)

[[Summary of 100 words or less]]

 
==== Description ====

As part of a discourse  (Writing Styles) page that tells about things that are off-topic 

[[Should it be about all formatting signals, or just when they are used to tell about things that are off-topic?]]
 
 
The ULB and UDB use the following: \\  
**Long dashes** - for information that is immediately relevant to the rest of the passage and to separate a general topic from a statement about it that follows.  (We may need to ask Jim more about this. I'm not sure if these are two different uses or the same use described in two ways.) 
 
**Parentheses** - To show that some information is off-topic 
 
**Indentation** - To show that certain lines in poetry are parallel, or to show that a paragraph is quoted material. 
 
We probably won't need the page for "Parenthesis" 

Example(s)  (from the Bible, or short ones we make up--not from English literature)\\ 
Purpose (optional)  \\ 
**Reason this is a translation issue:** (recommended) \\

==== Translation Principles  (optional) ====

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**ULB Text.** (Book c:v ) - Explanation of how this is an example \\ 
   

===== Translation Strategies =====
If (an) x would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it/one. If not, here [are other options / is another option] \\ 
//(Content writer, please replace x with the issue this page is about. Reword the two sentences as needed.)//
  - first strategy 
  - second strategy
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
A numbered list of examples that match the strategies above. Each strategy should have an example - even if the first strategy is to maintain the  form or figure. Each strategy should have only one  example because of  challenges with the Door43 formatting. \\ 
1. Copy of the strategy \\
