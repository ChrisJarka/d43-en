=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

**Paul Continues his Defense**

Paul says that he wants to present the Corinthian believers to Christ as pure and good. But he is afraid that false teachers, claiming to be super-apostles will deceive them and get them away from believing the truth, to believing in lies. He says it is foolish to boast but he will speak like a fool because the false apostles are speaking like fools. But these false teachers are not as good as Paul. He has suffered more for Christ then they all have. And he lists the very many things he has suffered for preaching the Gospel of Christ.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

**Metaphor**

Paul begins the chapter with an extended [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] of a father of the bride giving a pure virgin bride to her groom, “I promised you in marriage to one husband. I promised to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.” He also said “I robbed other churches” meaning he accepted help from them that the Corinthians should have given him. 

**Simile**

He follows the metaphor about being a bride with a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] comparing their being deceived to be like Eve being deceived by the snake, “as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts might be led astray away from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.”

**Irony**

This chapter is very full of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]].  He is hoping to shame the Corinthian believers with his irony. “You tolerate these things well enough!” Paul thinks that they should not tolerate the treatment the false apostles are treating them. “those so-called super-apostles" Paul does not think they are really apostles at all. “For you gladly put up with fools. You are wise yourselves!” Paul thinks the Corinthian believers think they themselves are very wise but Paul does not agree. “I will say to our shame that we were too weak to do that” Paul is speaking about behavior that he thinks is very wrong and so he will not do it. He is speaking as if he thinks he is wrong for not doing it. He used a  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] also as irony. “Did I sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted?”

** Rhetorical questions **

In refuting the false apostles’ claims of superiority, Paul used a series of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]s coupled with an answer: “Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. 23Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as though I were out of my mind.) I am more.” He also used a series of rhetorical questions to express empathy with his converts: “Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who has caused another to fall into sin, and I do not burn within?”

**Idiom**

He used several [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]s: “cut off the opportunity of”, meaning to stop those people from bragging, “to be found as we are,” meaning to be doing the same as we do,  “from his hands” meaning from his control.
