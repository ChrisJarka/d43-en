====== Dietary Customs ======



===== Definition: =====


In the culture of the Old Testament, there were only two meals a day morning and evening. The people had a midday rest and after this they did a number of important activities.  It was during the midday rest that:

  * Abraham sat in the door of his tent for a rest. Genesis 18:1
  * Ish-Bosheth stayed in his house 2 Samuel 4:5. 
 
The women prepared the evening meal on a fire for the men when they returned from work. 

The meal normally consisted of vegetables or a lentil stew (Genesis 5:29 & 34; Daniel 1:12) and was dished out of the common pot with a piece of bread.
The Israelites were given a list of animals that could be eaten. (Leviticus 11)
