====== Sentence Structure ======

//This answers the question:// //What are the parts of a sentence?//

//In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read://
  * //[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech]]//

===== Description =====

The simplest sentence structure in English includes a  //  **subject**  // and an  //  **action**  // word. // 'The boy ran.'  //

==== Subject ====

The //**subject**// is who or what the sentence is about. In these examples, the subject is underlined: 1) //'__The boy__  is running.'//  2) //'__He__  is running.'//

Subjects are typically noun phrases or pronouns. (See: [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:parts-of-speech]] for more information.) In the examples above, "the boy" is a noun phrase that has the noun 'boy,' and "he" is a pronoun.

Sometimes a subject is not stated but is implied. For example, //'Close the door//.' The verb is 'close'; the subject is implied to be 'you.' See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] for more information.

==== Predicate ====

The predicate is the part of a sentence that tells something about the subject. It usually has a verb. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_verbs]])


>'//The man is strong//.' 

The subject is '//the man//' and the predicate is '//is strong//' (It describes the man.)

>'//He worked hard//.'

The subject is 'he' and the predicate is 'worked hard' (It is something the man did.)

The verb may have an object or a complement:

>//'The man made a garden.'// 

In the sentence above, the subject is "the man," the verb is "made," and the object is "a garden."

>//'The man is strong.'//  

In the sentence above, the subject is "the man," the verb is "is," and the complement is "strong." (A complement is a phrase that completes the sentence, and says something about the subject.)

====Compound Sentences====

A sentence can be made up of more than one sentence. Each of the two lines below has a subject and a predicate and is a full sentence.
> '//He planted the yams.//'
> '//His wife planted the corn.//'

The compound sentence below has the two sentences above.

>'//__He planted the yams__ and __his wife planted the corn__//.'

Compound sentences are joined by a conjunction such as "and," "but," and "or".

==== Clauses ====

Clauses are like sentences in that they have a subject and a predicate. But clauses cannot stand alone. They are always part of a longer sentence. 

>'//__When the corn was ready__, his wife picked it//.'

The long sentence above has two parts: The phrase "When the corn was ready" is not a full sentence, because it cannot stand alone. It is a clause. The phrase "his wife picked it" can stand alone, so we call it a sentence.

Note: We are using the word //clause// for 'dependent clause' and //sentence// for 'independent clause' and for utterances that have at least one independent clause.

====Relative Clauses====
In some languages, clauses can tell about  in the sentence. These are called **relative** clauses.

   * Relative clauses can **distinguish**  which thing is being talked about. For example: '//She put a little food in her own bag and a lot of food in the bag __that belonged to her sister__//.' This relative clause '//that belonged to her sister//' defines which bag.
  * Relative clauses can **inform**  or **remind** the people about something. For example: '//She gave some of the food to her only sister, __who was very thankful__.//' The clause “//who was very thankful//” tells how her sister responded to her. Since she had only one sister, it does not tell which sister. 

Some languages can use relative clauses both to distinguish and inform or remind. Other languages only use them for defining.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Many sentences in the Bible have more than one clause. And each clause can have phrases in addition to the subject and verb.

A language may have a preferred order for its clauses and other phrases. For example some languages may prefer the order in the first example, while others may prefer the order in the second.

  - //She went to the garden to pick some tomatoes.//
  - //In order to pick some tomatoes, she went to the garden.//
A language may have a preferred word order for its subject, verb, and object or complement. (See: [[wordorder]]) For example, English and French normally put the object after the verb. But if the object is a pronoun, French puts it before the verb.

  * English: //The man sees __the house__.//
  * French: //L'homme voit __la maison__. //  (The man sees the house.)
  * English: //The man sees __it__. //
  * French: //L'homme __la__  voit. //  (The man it sees.)

Even within the noun phrase, languages have different word orders. For example, in English, adjectives come before the noun they describe. But in French, adjectives can occur before or after the noun, depending on their type.

  * English: //the __pretty__  flower//
  * French: //la __jolie__  fleur//  (the pretty flower)
  * English:// the __purple__  flower//
  * French:// la fleur __violette__// (The flower violette)

Translators should become aware of the following things in their language: the normal orders of clauses in sentences, the normal order of phrases in clauses, and the normal order of words in phrases. If their language allows variety, translators should learn what each variety is used to communicate.

Translators should became aware of the kinds of clauses their language has and their functions. They should understand the purposes of the clauses in the language they are translating from. When they are translating into their language, they should use the types of clauses and the clause orders that are natural in their own language and that have the same meaning as that of the language they are translating form .

For example, the relative clause in the examples below give added information about the house. Languages that do not use relative clauses and languages that do not use relative clauses for that purpose, will need another way of expressing the information.

 \\ '//After putting the food in the bags, she brought them to her **house**, __which was in the village__//.' \\ '//After putting the food in the bags, she brought them to her house. Her house was in the village.//'

//'Although the boy ran very hard, he couldn't catch the **fox**, __which disappeared into the woods__.'//  \\ //'Although the boy ran very hard, he couldn't catch the fox, because it disappeared into the woods.'//
