\v 20 So Yahweh was very angry with the Israelite people. He said, "These people have disobeyed the agreement I made with their ancestors They have not heeded what I told them.
\v 21 So I will no longer expel the people-groups that Joshua left in this land when he died.
\v 22 I will use them to test the Israelite people to see whether they will do what I want them to do, as their ancestors did."
\v 23 Yahweh had allowed these people-groups to stay in that land. He did not expel them by allowing Joshua \add and his men\add* to defeat them.

\v 20 And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel; and he said, Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which
I commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;
\v 21 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
\v 22 that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it,
or not.
\v 23 So Jehovah left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
