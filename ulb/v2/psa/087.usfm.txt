\c 87
\d A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song.
\q
\v 1 His foundation is in the holy mountains.
\q
\v 2 Jehovah loves the gates of Zion
\q More than all the dwellings of Jacob.
\q
\v 3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know me:
\q Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia:
\q This one was born there.
\q
\v 5 Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her;
\q And the Most High himself will establish her.
\q
\v 6 Jehovah will count, when he writes up the peoples,
\q This one was born there. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 7 They that sing as well as they that dance shall say,
\q All my fountains are in thee.
