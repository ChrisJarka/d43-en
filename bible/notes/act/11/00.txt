====== Acts 11 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "The Gentiles also had received the word of God" ==
In the early church, its members were almost exclusively Jewish. Then, the Gentiles started to believe in Jesus. This is what it means that to "receive the word of God." This was criticized by many Jews at first.

== "Baptism in the Holy Spirit" ==

Many scholars believe that this indicates the Spirit began to indwell, or live inside their heart in order to guide them when they believed in Jesus. Others believe that this gave the ability to speak in tongues in addition to indwelling them and is an event that occurs after salvation.
