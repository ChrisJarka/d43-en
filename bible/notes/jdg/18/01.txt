\p
\v 1 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell
in; for to that day their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.
\v 2 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol,
to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land. And they came to the hill-country of
Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
