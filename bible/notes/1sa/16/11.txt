\v 11 And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he is
keeping the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.
\v 12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And
