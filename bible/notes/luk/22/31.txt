\v 31 "Simon, Simon, look out!/listen! Satan has asked [God to let him test] for you, he wants to separate you from me as chaff from wheat .[and God has permitted him to do it. Satan wants to cause you to suffer distress
so that you will not believe in me anymore. He wants to shake you, just like a man shakes wheat in a sieve.]
\v 32 But I have prayed especially for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail [completely stop believing in me.] so that when you have returned to faith in me, you may strengthen these, your brothers. [So when you restore your relationship with me, help your fellow apostles to trust in me more!"]
