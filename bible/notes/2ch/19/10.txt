\v 10 In every dispute that your fellow Israelites who live in the cities want you to settle, you must warn them to not sin against Yahweh by telling lies during the trialâ€”regardless of whether the trial is about murder, or about various laws, or about various royal decress. If you do not warn them, God will punish you. Do this so that he does not become angry with you or your fellow Israelites.

\v 10 Whenever any dispute comes to you from your brothers who live in their cities, whether concerning bloodshed, whether about laws and commands, statutes or decrees, you must warn them, so they do not become guilty before Yahweh, or anger will come toward you and toward your brothers. You shall do this and you will not be guilty.
