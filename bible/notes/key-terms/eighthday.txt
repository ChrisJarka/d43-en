====== on the eighth day ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Old Testament, male Jewish babies were circumcised on the eighth day after birth according to Jewish tradition.

  * Circumcision was required by God and was a symbol of the covenant relationship of the members of Abraham's family to God.
  * In the New Testament, some Christians with a Jewish background wanted to keep this Jewish Tradition, and that became a source of conflict with Paul even though he had been circumcised himself on the eighth day.
  *
