\v 27 That ruler will make a strong agreement with many people. He will promise to do what he has said in that agreement for seven years. But when that time is half finished, he will prevent priests from giving any more offerings and sacrifices to God. A disgusting idol will be put on the highest part of the temple, and it will stay there until \add God\add* gets rid of the one who put it there, which is what he said that he would do."

\v 27 And he shall confirm a covenant with many for one seven; and in the middle of the seven he shall put an end to the sacrifice and the offering. And upon the wing of abominations shall come one that makes desolate; and a full end and a decisive event is poured out on the one who 
is making desolation.
