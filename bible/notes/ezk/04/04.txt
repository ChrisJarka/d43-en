\v 4 Then, lie on your left side and set the iniquity of the house of Israel against it:
their sins will be lifted up upon it according to the number of the days that you lie down against it.
[[Here and elsewhere in theses chapters, I opted for "lifted up" iniquity rather than "bore/bear." The sense is one of a public display, not a martyrdom. Lifted up has the sense of showing everyone their iniquity; bearing usually means it is being carried (as Christ bore sins) and is not the right picture for this passage.]]
\v 5 I myself have appointed to you the years of their iniquity as the number of days--390 days! So you will 
lift up the iniquity of the house of Israel.
