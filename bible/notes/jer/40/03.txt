\v 3 And now he has caused it to happen. He has done just what he said that he would do, because you people sinned against Yahweh and refused to obey him.
\v 4 But today I am going to take the chains off your wrists and release you. If you want to come with me to Babylon, \add that will be fine\add*. I will take care of you. But if you do not want to come with me, do not come. \add Stay here\add*. Look, the entire country is available; you can choose whatever part you want to go to. You can go wherever you wish." \add Then he took the chains off my wrists\add*.

\v 3 So Yahweh brought it and did just as he declared since you sinned against Yahweh and did not listen to his voice, so this thing has come to you.
\v 4 But now look! I have released you this day from the manacles that were upon your hands. If it is good in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, come and I will set my eyes over you. 
But if it is evil in your eyes to come with me to Bablyon, stop. Look at all the land before you to go to the good and the right: go there!‚Äù
