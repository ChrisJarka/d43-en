\v 12 When they saw Job from a distance, they almost did not recognize him. They wailed loudly, they tore their robes, and they threw dust over their heads \add to show how sorry they were because of what had happened to Job\add*.
\v 13 Then they sat on the ground with Job for seven days. None of them said anything to Job, because they saw that he was suffering greatly, \add and they did not think that anything that they said would lessen his pain\add*.

\v 12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they tore every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
\v 13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him: for they saw that his grief was very great.
