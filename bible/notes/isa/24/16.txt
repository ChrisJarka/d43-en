===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **we have heard** - "We" refers to people who remain in Israel after God judges the earth. Isaiah is describing something in the future as if it has already happened. This emphasizes that the event will certainly happen. Alternate translation: "we will hear"
    * **But I said** - The word "I" refers to Isaiah. Isaiah is now talking about his present situation where terrible things are happening. 
    * **I have wasted away, I have wasted away** - Isaiah repeats this phrase for emphasis. Alternate translation: "I have become very weak." Isaiah was very concerned because he saw people who deceived others and did not honor their commitments. 
    * **The treacherous have dealt treacherously; yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously** - Isaiah repeats this phrase for emphasis. Alternate translation: "Indeed, those who deceive are now deceiving others" or "Indeed, the deceivers have acted deceitfully."
