\v 39 And the Lord said to him, Now you the Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
\v 40 You foolish ones, did not he that made the outside make the inside also?
\v 41 But give for alms those things which are within; and behold, all things are clean to you.
