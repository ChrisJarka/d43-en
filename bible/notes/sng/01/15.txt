===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Listen** - "Listen carefully" or "What I am about to say is important." You could use a word in your language that tells the hearer to listen carefully.
  * **my love** - "you whom I love." Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:09|1:9]]
  * **your eyes are doves** - One possible is that the Israelites considered doves to be gentle and soft birds, and the man considers the woman's eyes beautiful because the way the woman looks at him makes him think she is gentle. AT: "you are very gentle" Another possibility is that the man is speaking of the woman's white eyeballs or the shape of her eyes, the shape of a dove. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
