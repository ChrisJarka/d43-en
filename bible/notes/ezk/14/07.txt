\v 8 I will show that I detest him, and cause \add what happens to\add* him to be a warning to others, and cause him to be someone whom people despise. I will cause him to longer be allowed to associate with my people. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.

\v 7 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that separateth himself from me, and
takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to
inquire for himself of me; I Jehovah will answer him by myself:
\v 8 and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him
off from the midst of my people; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
