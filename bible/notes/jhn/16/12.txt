\v 12 I have many more things that\add I would like\add* to tell you, but you are not able to accept them now.
\v 13 But \add God's\add* Spirit is the one who will teach you \add God's\add* truth. When he comes, he will guide you so that you \add understand\add* all \add spiritual\add* truth. He will not speak from his own \add authority\add*. Instead, it is the things that he hears \add my Father say\add* that he will tell you. He will also tell you about things that will happen \add later\add*.
\v 14 He will honor me by taking my \add truth\add* and revealing it to you.

\v 12 I have many more things I want to tell you, but if I told you now, they would be for you like a heavy burden that you didn't have the strength to carry.
\v 13 But when the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you to find all the truth there is. He will not speak out of his own authority, but whatever he hears he will announce to you about future events.
\v 14 The Spirit will explain who I am and tell you what I have done. He will do this by telling you all that he received from me.

<usfm>
\v 12 I have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
\v 13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from
himself; but what things soever he shall hear, these shall he speak: and he shall declare to you the things that
are to come.
\v 14 He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare
it to you.
