====== Speech Quotations ======


===== Definition: =====


In English there are direct or non-direct, or indirect, quotations.


    * **DIRECT**  quotations are when the words that were said originally are used. (She said, "Come." and then he said, "I will come.")
    * **INDIRECT**  or **NON-DIRECT**  quotations are when the original words are changed. (She told him to come. He said he would come.) The quote marks _ckgedit_QUOT__ckgedit_QUOT__________ckgedit_QUOT__ckgedit_QUOT_ are not used and often there is a change in the verb tense.
===== How to Translate =====


Some languages have more than one kind of **NON-DIRECT**quotations. If that is true of your language, consider the best non-direct quotation you should use.


Remember that **DIRECT**  quotes in the source text should be direct quotes in the translated text. Perhaps your language organizes the sentence differently, you should then organize the sentence to keep the direct quote.
