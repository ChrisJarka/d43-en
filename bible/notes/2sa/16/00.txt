====== 2 Samuel 16 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

==David leaves Jerusalem ==
David and the soldiers loyal to him left Jerusalem before Absalom arrived with his army. Ziba brought David's army some food and drink. Shimei, one of Saul's relatives, went along the hilltops cursing David and throwing stones. Joab's brother ask permission to take the man's head off but David did not allow him to. He said that maybe God would bless him when he saw how he was being treated. 
== Absalom seeks advice from David's advisers ==
David's best adviser, Ahithophel, told Absalom to publicly seduce the concubines that David had left to take care of the palace. This would show the people that the breach with David was complete.


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===
== Simile ==
To show how seriously people took Ahithophel's advise, the author used a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] comparing his advise to God's advise. "Now the advice of Ahithophel that he gave in those days was as if a man heard from the mouth of God himself."
