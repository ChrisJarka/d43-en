\c 10
\p
\v 1 Brethren, my heart’s desire and my supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved.
\v 2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
\v 3 For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
