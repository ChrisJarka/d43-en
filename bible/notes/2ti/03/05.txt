\v 5 \add And, although they will\add* pretend that they worship God, they will not let \add God's Spirit\add* work powerfully \add in their lives\add*. Do not associate with such people \f + \ft Or: Do not let such people join \add your congregation\add* \f*,
\v 6 because some such \add people, even now\add*, subtly\f + \ft Or: deceivingly \f* persuade foolish women to let them come into their houses, and then they deceive those women \add so that they control what those women think. These women\add* have been burdened with sins \f + \ft Or:have sinned very much \f* and they have been led to do \f + \ft Or:they do \f* the many \add evil\add* things that they strongly desire to do.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 They will seem to honor God, but they will refuse to accept the power that God truly wants to give them. Stay away from people like this.
\v 6 These men persuade foolish women to let them come into their houses. Then they deceive those women so that they control what they think. These are women who sin all the time, so they follow these evil men into doing all sorts of bad things that they enjoy doing.
\v 7 Even though these women are always wanting to learn new things, they are never able to learn what is actually true.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 They will have a form of godliness, but they will deny the power of it. Turn away from these people.
\v 6 For some of them are men who enter into households and captivate foolish women who are overwhelmed with sins and are led away by various desires.
\v 7 These women are always trying to learn new  things, yet they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
