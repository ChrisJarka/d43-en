====== Maintenance Tasks post-Phase2 ======

This is a list of ongoing tasks and tasks that we are postponing until after Phase 2 is complete.

This page is a "work in progress." New tasks need to be added and existing tasks need to be evaluated.

This list may get long. It may make it easier to see what is here if we list the tasks alphabetically by translation issue.
==== One-time tasks: ====

  * **Anthropomorphism tA page** - Write page and make links to it to deal with God being spoken of as if he had a body???
