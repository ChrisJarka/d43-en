===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Return it to its sheath**  - The word "sheath" refers to a pocket made to hold a sword or knife.  This phrase means the Israelites will be taken by the Ammonites.  (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metaphor]])
  * **In the place of your creation, in the land of your origin**  - The word "your" refers to the people of Israel. God is saying he's going to take them back to where God promised Abram to create from him a nation.  This promise was made in the land of Ur in Babylon.  God is saying they are going to be taken to Babylon where their ancestor Abraham was from.  He states this in two different ways to be understood and to show the importance of what He's saying. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:parallelism]])
  * **I will pour out my indignation upon you! I will fan the fire of my rage against you**  - God is saying the same thing in different ways.  He does this to show the importance of what he's saying.  These phrases are speaking about God no longer waiting to punish the people of Israel for their actions. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:parallelism]])
  * **I will pour out my indignation upon you**  - The word "indignation" means anger at a bad action or situation.  God says he will "pour out" his indignation or anger.  This means he will allow it to happen.  He compares his anger to a bowl of water that has been collected but is now poured out. Alternate translation: "I will act on my anger against you" (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metaphor]])
  * **I will fan the fire of my rage**  - The word "rage" means anger.  Someone fans a fire in order to make it hotter and bigger.  Fire is very hot and is used to show how angry God is at the people of Israel.   God is saying he is going to allow his anger to grow. Alternate translation: "I will allow myself to become more angry" (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metaphor]])
  * **cruel men, craftsmen of destruction**  - Here God says the same thing in two different ways. He does this to help us understand what these poeple are like.  (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:doublet]])
  * **in the hand of cruel men**  - The word "cruel" means someone who will hurt others without feeling bad about it. Alternate translation: "in the control of men who will want to hurt you"
  * **craftsmen of destruction**  - The word "craftsmen" refers to a person who builds things.  Alternate translation: "people who create ways to destroy others"  (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metaphor]])
