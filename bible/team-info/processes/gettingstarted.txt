===== 3. Go to your assigned Book or Chapter. =====


==== Namespace====

Namespace is the term for the directory, or folder, of the pages. Most of the pages that you will work on are in the en:bible namespace. (The "en" namespace means English, the "bible" namespace is the working namespace and the "bible" namespace is where the pages will go when they are finally done.)
{{en:bible:team-info:processes:namespaces.png?nolink&350x150}}

Click on the blue name of the namespace (has a gray triangle to the left of the name) to open the namespace (directory.)

==== How to Use the Sitemap ====

Watch the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xZ_4nPOBOU|video]] on how to use the Sitemap or follow these steps:
  * Click the Sitemap link at the top right of the wiki. 
  * The Sitemap opens at the point of the page you were on. (For example: If you were in Luke the Sitemap will already have the book of Luke namespace open.)
  * Click on the namespace, in blue text, to display the list of pages in the directory.
  * Click on the page, in green text, to open a page.
