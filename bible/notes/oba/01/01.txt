===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The Vision of Obadiah** - This is the title of the book. Here "Vision" is used in the general sense of a message from Yahweh, rather than to indicate how Obadiah received the message. AT: "The Message of Obadiah" or "The Prophesy of Obadiah"
  * **The Lord Yahweh says this concerning Edom** - This tells the reader that the entire book is a message about Edom.
  * **Yahweh** - This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the translationWord page about Yahweh concerning how to translate this.
  * **an ambassador has been sent** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh has sent an ambassador" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Rise up** - "Stand up." This phrase is used to tell people to get ready.
  * **rise up against her** - Here "her" refers to Edom. This is a metonym for the people of Edom, so it could also be translated as "them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Behold, I will make you** - Beginning in verse 2, Obadiah records the words that Yahweh speaks directly to Edom.
  * **Behold** - This alerts the reader to pay special attention to what follows. AT: "Look" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **I will make you small among the nations, you will be greatly despised** - These two phrases mean similar things and are used to emphasize that Edom will lose its important status. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **I will make you small among the nations** - Something that is insignificant is spoken of as if it is of small size, and can easily be overlooked. AT: "I will make you insignificant among the nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will be greatly despised** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the people of other nations will hate you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
