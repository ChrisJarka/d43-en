\v 4 Think about what you have done. You have not paid wages to the workmen who have harvested your fields for you. Now those reapers are crying out to God for him to help them. And God, the all-powerful Lord, has heard their loud cries.
\v 5 You have bought anything you wanted so you could live like kings. Just like cattle fatten themselves, not realizing that they will be slaughtered, you have lived just to enjoy things, not realizing that God will severely punish you.
\v 6 You have arranged for others to condemn innocent people. You have arranged for others to kill people, eventhough those people had not done anything wrong. They were not able to defend themselves against you. My brothers and sisters, that is what I say to the rich people who oppress you.

\v 4 Look, the pay of the laborers who harvested your fields, whom you have not paid, cries out! And the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Armies.
\v 5 You have lived in luxury on the earth and indulged yourselves. You have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter.
\v 6 You have condemned and killed the righteous man, the one who does not resist you.
