\v 24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up what is lacking in my flesh of the afflictions of Christ for his bodyâ€™s sake, which is the church;
\v 25 and, I serve the church according to the management of God that was given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God
\v 26--the mystery--that God has hidden for ages and for generations but now which God has revealed to his holy ones,
\v 27 to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery that includes the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
