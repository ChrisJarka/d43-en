=== What is the Gospel of Luke about? ===

The Gospel according to Luke is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ, but focus especially on his work. The four Gospel emphasize different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. It is probable that the book was written to produce an accurate description of the life of Jesus. The Gospel of Luke the first of two volumes written by Luke, Acts is the second. The gospel was probably written to a Gentile audience. 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "The Gospel of Luke," or "The Gospel according to Luke." Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, for example, "The Good News about Jesus that Luke wrote." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Luke? ===

The book does not give the reader the name of the author. Since early Christian times, however, it has been generally believed that the author was Luke because he is the only person who could be included in the passages using the word "we." Luke was a medical doctor and his way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile who was sympathetic to Judaism, but he was not a convert to Judaism. Although he was not an eyewitness to the ministry of Jesus, but as he wrote his accounts, he consulted many people who were.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
=== What is the role of women in Luke?===

In the ancient Near East, the role of women was typically undervalued. Often, a woman's testimony would not have been given authority in a courtroom. In the Gospel of Luke, women play a prominent and very important role. It is often the women who are the most [[:en:obe:kt:faithful|faithful]] to Yahweh.

=== Why does Luke spend a great deal of time recording the final week of Jesus' life?===

While the life of Jesus is important, it is his sacrificial death that is of greatest importance to the Christian. His life provides an example for Christians to follow, but it also prepares Jesus to be a sacrifice which is free from the taint of sin. Luke's focus on the events immediately prior to Jesus's death emphasize that Jesus willingly died for the sins of man.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What are the Synoptic Gospels? ===

The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the synoptic gospels because they share a large amount of textual material. However, the authors often used the same accounts and the same teachings of Jesus to emphasize different aspects of his life, ministry, and message.

When text is the same or almost the same among two or three gospels, it is said to be "parallel." When these parallel passages are translated, the wording in the project language should be kept the same as much as possible.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Luke? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of more accurate manuscripts. The follow are the most significant issues in Luke:\\

  * "Then an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground." (22:43–44) 
  * "For he was required to release one prisoner during the feast" (23:17) (so noted in ULB)
  * "Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." (23:34)


Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to Luke's Gospel.
