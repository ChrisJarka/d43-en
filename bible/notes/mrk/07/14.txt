===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **There is nothing from outside of a person that can defile him when it enters into him. It is what comes out of the person that defiles him.**  - Jesus begins to teach all the people, not just the Pharisees. It isn't lack of ceremony, or what we eat or drink that makes us unacceptable to be in God's presence. What we say, and do, or refuse to do to obey him make us unfit to be in God's presence. It is not our ceremonies, but our loving obedience that draw us near to him.
  * **v16**  - Many ancient mauscripts and translations include this text: If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.  This phrase has Jesus adding his doctrinal authority and urgency to every faithful follower observing what was just taught.
