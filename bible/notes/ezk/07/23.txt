===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues his prophecy of judgment on Israel through  Ezekiel.

  * **the land is filled with the judgment of blood**  - "everywhere in the country people are dying as a result of God's punishment"
  * **city is full of violence**  - "violence is everywhere in the city"
  * ** and they will possess their houses**  - The word "they" refers to the wicked.  The word "their" refers to people of Israel.  
  * ** and they will possess their houses**  - The word "possess" means to have or own. "and the wicked will own the people of Israel's houses"
  * **Fear will come**  - Though the emotion "fear" cannot move, it will be where it was not before.  "The people will be afraid"  (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:personification]])
  * **They will seek peace, but there will be none**  - The word "seek" means to "look for" or "try to find." This means the people want peace.  They will try to get away from the killing and violence so they will not be afraid but they will not be able to get away. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:personification]])
