<usfm> \v 20 Then Job stood up and tore his robe and shaved his head because he was very sad. Then he laid down on the ground to worship God. \v 21 He said, \q1 "When I was born, I had no clothes. \q1 When I die, I will not take any clothes with me. \q1 Yahweh gave me everything that I possessed, \q1 and now he has taken it all away. \q1 But we should always praise Yahweh!" \p \v 22 So in spite of all the things that happened to Job, he did speak not like a foolish man—he did not sin by saying that what God had done was wrong.* </usfm>
