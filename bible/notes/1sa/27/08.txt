\v 8 And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those
nations were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.
\v 9 And David struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel; and he returned, and came to Achish.
