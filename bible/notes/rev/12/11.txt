====== Revelation 12:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Our fellow believers overcame him because they never stopped trusting 
\q1 \f + \ft Or: never stopped telling people about \f* Jesus, 
\q1 and because they trusted in what the one who is like a lamb accomplished 
\q1 when his blood flowed when he died.
\q1 Even though those believers wanted to live, 
\q1 they were willing to let people kill them for speaking truly about him.
\q1
\v 12 So, all you angels living \f + \ft metonymy \f* in heaven, rejoice!
\q1 But terrible things will happen to you ungodly people who \f + \ft metonymy \f* live on the earth and 
\q1 on the ocean, because the devil has come down to you!
\q1 He is very angry because he knows that he has only a short time 
\q1 during which he can harm people.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Our fellow believers overcame him because the lamb had shed his blood and died for them, 
\q1 and because they said the truth about him to other people.
\q1 They did not seek to remain alive, 
\q1 but were willing to let people kill them for speaking truly about him.
\q1
\v 12 So everyone in heaven should rejoice.
\q1 But terrible things will happen to you people who live on the earth and on the ocean, because the devil has come down to you!
\q1 He is very angry because he knows that he has only a short time before God judges him.

\v 11 They overcame him through of the blood of the Lamb and through  the word of their testimony. They did not love their lives, even to death.
\v 12 Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who live in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has gone down to you. He is very angry, knowing that he has but a short time.
