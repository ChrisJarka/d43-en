\v 6 But those whom God puts right with himself because they trust in Christâ€”to them Moses does not say, "No one can find out how to go to heaven," that is, in order to bring Christ down to us.
\v 7 Moses also does not say this to them: "No one can find out how to go down to where the dead are," that is, in order to bring Christ back from the dead for us.
