\v 17 He liked to curse people.
\q2 So those terrible things that he requested to happen to othersâ€”cause them to happen to him!
\q1 He did not want to bless others,
\q2 so make sure that no one blesses him!
\q1
\v 18 He often cursed other people, also;
\q2 cause the terrible things that he wanted to happen to others to happen to him and enter his body as water does,
\q2 as olive oil soaks into a person's bones when it is rubbed on his skin.


\q1

\v 17 He loved cursing; may it come back upon him.

\v 18 He clothed himself with cursing as his garment,
\q and his curse came into his inner being like water,
\q like oil into his bones.

===== Translation Notes: =====

David continues to ask God to punish a person who attacked him with his words and returned hatred for his love.
  * **He loved cursing** - "He loved curses" or "loved to curse other people"
  * **may it come back upon him** - Possible meanings are 1) "his curse came back to him" or 2) "his curse entered into him."
  * **may no blessing come to him** - This could also be translated as, "so blessing was far from him." This phrase means "so he had no blessing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **He clothed himself...into his bones** - David uses these images to emphasize that curses filled every part of the man, on his outside, on his inside, and even into the innermost part of him. AT: "Curses became part of who he was and all he could do was curse other people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He clothed himself with cursing as his garment** - "He put curses on like clothes." People wear clothes on their outside." (See: 5. Clothing is Moral Quality in [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimagery]])
  * **into his inner being** - "entered into him." When people drink water, it goes inside of them. (See: 6. A Liquid is a Moral Quality in [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimagery]])
  * **like oil into his bones** - AT: "Curses went into his bones like oil goes into bones." The bones are the innermost part of a person. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
