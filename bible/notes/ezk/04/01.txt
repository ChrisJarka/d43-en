<usfm> \c 4 \p \v 1 But you, Son of man, take a brick for yourself and place it before you. Then engrave the city of Jerusalem upon it. \v 2 And lay siege against it, and build forts against it. Raise up an assault ramp against it and set camps around it. Place battering rams all around it. \v 3 And you, take for yourself an iron pan, and use it as an iron wall between yourself and the city. Set your face against it and the city, for it will be under siege. So lay siege against it! This will be a sign to the house of Israel. </usfm>
