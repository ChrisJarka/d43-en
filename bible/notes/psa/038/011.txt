====== Psalms 038:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 My friends and neighbors stay away from me because of my sores;
\q2 even my own family stays far from me.
\q1
\v 12 And those who want to kill me set traps to catch me;
\q2 those who want to harm me discuss the ways that they can get rid of me;
\q2 they plot against me all day.
\b
\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague;
\q And my kinsmen stand afar off.
\q
\v 12 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me;
\q And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things,
\q And meditate deceits all the day long.
</usfm>
