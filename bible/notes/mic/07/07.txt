===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verse 8 Micah begins speaking as if he were one woman speaking to her enemy, another woman. This is perhaps the daughter of Zion ([[:en:bible:notes:mic:01:13|1:13]]), who represents the people of Israel, speaking to the "daughter of soldiers" ([[:en:bible:notes:mic:05:01|5:1]]), who represents the nations which attacked Israel. All commands and instances of "you" are feminine singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])

  * **But as for me** - Here "me" refers to Micah.
  * **I will wait for the God of my salvation** - The abstract noun "salvation" can be translated as a verb. AT: "I will wait for the God who saves me" or "I will wait for God, who saves me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **will hear me** - The word "hear" represents hearing and acting. AT: "will act to help me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **fall ... rise** - These words are metaphors for suffering from disaster and then recovering. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **sit in darkness** - These words are a metaphor for suffering from disaster. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
