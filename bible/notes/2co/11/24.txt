\v 24 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
\v 25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep;
\v 26 in journeyings often, in perils of rivers,
in perils of robbers, in perils from my countrymen,
in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city,
in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea,
in perils among false brethren;
