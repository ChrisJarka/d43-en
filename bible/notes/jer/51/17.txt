<usfm>
\v 17 Every man is become brutish and is without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his image; for his
molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\v 18 They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\v 19 The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.
