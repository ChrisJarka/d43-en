\v 8 Behold! I am coming with them from the north land and I will gather them from the furthest parts of the earth;
\q The blind and lame will be with them, pregnant women and those delivering a child will be together! 
\q A great assembly will return here!
\q
\v 9 They will come with weeping, and I will lead them in their supplications; I will bring them to rivers of water!
\q On a straight path! They will not stumble on it, for I will be a father to Israel,
\q And Ephraim will be my firstborn!
