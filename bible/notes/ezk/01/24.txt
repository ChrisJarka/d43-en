===== Translation Notes: =====

Ezekiel continues to tell about his vision of the living creatures.

  * **Like the noise of rushing water** - This can be translated as a sentence: "The sound of their wings was loud like rushing water." (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]]) 
  * **rushing water** - The phrase used for "rushing water" simply mean "a lot of water." The phrase could be used to refer to "a loud river", "a large waterfall", or "the waves crashing at the ocean". All of these have a very loud and similar sound. Any one of them would be a good translation for "rushing water."
  * **Like the voice of the Almighty** - The Bible sometimes refers to thunder as "the voice of the Almighty." The sound of the creatures wings is loud like thunder is loud. Alternate translation as a new sentence: "It sounded like thunder" or "It was very loud like thunder." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]]) 
  * ** there was the sound of a rainstorm** - Possible meanings are: 1) "the sound of very big storm" or 2) "the sound of a very large crowd of people." Big storms and large crowds of people are very loud and make a lot of noise. Alternate translation: "there was a sound that was loud like a big storm" or "there was a sound that was loud like a very large crowd of people."
  * **Whenever they stood still** – "Whenever the creatures stopped moving"
  * **they lowered their wings** – "the creatures let their wings hang down by their sides." When the creatures were not using their wings to fly, they let their wings hang down and hold still.
  * **the dome over their heads** - "the dome that was over the heads of the creatures"
