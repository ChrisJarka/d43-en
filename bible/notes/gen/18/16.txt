\v 16 Then the men arose to leave and looked down toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way.
\v 17 But Yahweh said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
\v 18 since Abraham will indeed become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?
\v 19 For I have chosen him, that he may instruct his children and his household after him, to keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice, so that Yahweh may bring upon Abraham all that he has promised him."
