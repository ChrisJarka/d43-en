===== License =====

This module answers the question: //What does the license determine for distribution?//

Distribution options depend significantly on the terms of the content license.

==== Open-licensed (CC BY-SA, Public Domain) ====
If you recorded and produced open-licensed content, you are free to distribute the audio content in the best  ways of your choice and in any quantity.

==== Restricted-license (Copyright All Rights Reserved) ====
If you recorded and produced restricted-license content, the distribution requirements and limitations are set forth in the contract or agreement. If you want to distribute copyrighted content already produced by others, the copyright holder will have set terms for how the content may or may not be distributed. Therefore, some, or much, of what can be done to distribute CC By-SA content may not be legally possible for copyrighted content. This may lead to frustration, extra costs and missed opportunities. It is true that at no point in a project are the constraints of All Rights Reserved copyright so evident as when you want to share content with people in need of it.

These restrictions commonly cause broad challenges and frustrations for God's family in the real-world context. This can lead to decisions to break the license terms or, as the copyright holder, allow one group, but not others, to distribute content out of compliance with the license terms. Such actions are hurtful among God's family. There are also potential ramifications for recipients of restricted content. In some countries, breaking copyright law is a criminal offense. Legal action against the recipient of copyright restricted material can be pursued by the government without the request or consent of the copyright holder.

Our question is if this is the best way for God's family to participate in ministry together? Would it not be much better for God's family to work together in a way that did not require our brothers and sisters to break the law? This situation is not a problem created by the laws of governments. Instead this is a problem created by content producers choosing a license that legally restricts and controls access to Biblical content. Governments are only enforcing the license terms.

As a content producer, consider being part of the solution that avoids all of these restrictions and difficulties. Use a license that and allows all of us to work together and bless others with God's message in their heart language without all the problems mentioned above.
