===== Description =====

**Definition**: Irony is using words that appear to say the opposite of what the speaker or writer means. Irony is often used as humor or to emphasize how different something is from what it should be, or how someone's belief is incorrect or wrong. 

**Example**: “When Jesus heard this he said to them, ‘People who are strong in body do not need a physician; only people who are sick need one. I did not come to call **__righteous__** people, but sinful people.’ ” (Mark 2:17 ULB)\\
When Jesus refers here to “righteous people,” he is not referring to literal “righteous people,” but instead he is referring to people who __think__ they are righteous (but they are actually unrighteous). The Bible makes it clear that Jesus had to die for ALL people in the world because, “… __all have sinned__ and come short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23 ULB)  So, Jesus came to call “sinful people” to believe in Him, and that includes everyone! There are no “righteous people” who do not need the eternal forgiveness that only Jesus Christ can give!

**Purpose**: Using irony is a powerful way to cause people to listen to and think about the message a speaker or writer wants the hearer or reader to understand. A speaker might repeat the statement of irony to emphasize it, but the speaker does not actually believe that statement. The statement of irony is to cause people to listen and think deeply. The listeners or readers must understand the context of a statement of irony to understand it. The context will also show that the speaker or writer does not actually agree with the literal statement of irony.

**Reason this could be a translation issue**:
If a reader understands a statement of irony as if it is literally true, then the reader will misunderstand the entire meaning that is intended and will likely even believe something to be true that is the direct __opposite__ of what is true!  Irony presents a false statement as if it is true to strongly emphasize something that is very true, and very important. So, the reader must understand the point of irony, which is: to present an untruth as if it is true in order to emphasize what is really true and how important that actual truth is.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**1.**  “After blindfolding him, they asked him, saying, ‘__Prophesy__! __Who is the one who hit you__?’ ” (Luke 22:64 ULB)
\\ The soldiers were hitting Jesus and told him to prophesy and say who hit him. This was irony because the soldiers were implying that if Jesus was a really a prophet, he should be able to tell who hit him without seeing them. But the soldiers did not believe that Jesus was a real prophet. They told Jesus to prophesy because they were mocking him and wanted to prove that he was not really a prophet.\\

**2.**  “ ‘Present your case,’ says Yahweh; ‘present your best arguments for your idols,’ says the King of Jacob. __Let them bring us their own arguments__; have them come forward and __declare to us what will happen__, so we may know these things well. Have them __tell us__ of earlier predictive declarations, so we can reflect on them and know how they were fulfilled.”  (Isaiah 41:21-22 ULB)\\
Here Yahweh is mocking the people and their idols. He is __challenging their idols to speak__ and tell what will happen in the future, but he knows __they cannot even speak__. 
 
**3.**  “Foolish Galatians, __whose evil eye has harmed you__? Was not Jesus Christ depicted as crucified before your eyes?” (Galatians 3:1 ULB)\\
Paul is speaking to the Galatians using irony and asking a rhetorical question, suggesting that the Galatians are __acting as though someone has put a spell on them__ with the “evil eye.” However, Paul does not really believe that someone has put a spell on them. 

**4.**  “Can you lead light and darkness to their places of work?\\
Can you find the way back to their houses for them?\\
__Undoubtedly you know, for you were born then;\\
the number of your days is so large__!”   (Job 38:20, 21 ULB)\\
Yahweh rebukes Job because Job seems to believe that he knows about how light and darkness originated, as if he was present when they were created by Yahweh.

===== Translation Strategies =====

**1.**  If the irony would be understood correctly in your language, translate it as it is stated.\\
\\
**2.**  If the irony would not be understood correctly, you could translate the actual, intended meaning of the statement of irony. The actual meaning of the irony is __not__ found in the literal words of the speaker, but instead the true meaning is found in the opposite of the literal meaning of the speaker's words.     

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

**1.**  If the irony would be understood correctly in your language, translate it as it is stated.

**2.**  If the irony would not be understood correctly, you could translate the actual, intended meaning of the statement of irony. The actual meaning of the irony is not found in the literal words of the speaker, but instead the true meaning is found in the opposite of the literal meaning of the speaker's words. 

**Examples** (each of the following examples are explained above):

Mark 2:17b could be translated something like:\\ 
“I have not come to call __those who think they are righteous__ to repentance, but __those who know they are sinners__.”\\ 
\\
Luke 22:64 ULB could be translated something like:\\
 “After blindfolding him, they said to him, ‘__You are not a prophet because you cannot even tell us who struck you!__’ ”\\ 
\\
Isaiah 41:21-22 ULB could be translated something like:\\ 
“ ‘Present your case,’ says Yahweh; ‘present your best arguments for your idols,’ says the King of Jacob. Your idols __cannot bring us their own arguments or even come forward to  declare to us what will happen__. We cannot hear them because __they cannot speak__ to tell us their earlier predictive declarations, so we cannot reflect on them and know how they were fulfilled.”\\  
\\ 
Galatians 3:1 ULB could be translated something like:\\ 
“Foolish Galatians, __you act like someone has put a spell on you with the evil eye__. Was not Jesus Christ depicted as crucified before your eyes?” (Galatians 3:1 ULB)\\
\\
Job 38:20, 21 ULB could be translated something like:\\ 
“Can you lead light and darkness to their places of work?
Can you find the way back to their houses for them?
__You act like you know how light and darkness were created, as if you were there;
as if you are as old as creation__!”   (Job 38:20, 21 ULB)
