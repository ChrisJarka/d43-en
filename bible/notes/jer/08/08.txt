\q1
\v 9 Those teachers, who think that \f + \ft irony \f* they are wise, will be ashamed\f + \ft Or: disgraced \f* and dismayed when they are taken \add to other countries by their enemies\add*
\q2 because they sinned by rejecting what I told them.
\q1 Truly, they were not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* very wise to do that!
\q1
\v 10 So, I will give their wives to other men;
\q2 I will give their fields to \add the enemy soldiers\add* who conquer them.
\q1 All the people, including those who are important and those who are not important, deceive others in order to obtain their possessions.
\q2 Even my prophets and my priests do that.

\v 8 Your men who teach you the laws that Moses wrote have been saying false things about those laws.
\q So, why do they continue saying, "We are very wise because we have the laws of Yahweh"?
\q
\v 9 Those teachers, who think that they are wise, will be ashamed and dismayed when they are taken to other countries by their enemies
\q Because they sinned by rejecting what I told them. Truly, they were not very wise to do that!
\q
\v 10 So, I will give their wives to other men; I will give their fields to the enemy soldiers who conquer them.
\q All the people, including those who are least important and those who are most important, they all are trying to get money by tricking others 
\q Even my prophets and priests, they all lie to get what they want.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 How can you say, "We are wise, for the law of Yahweh is with us"?
\q Indeed, see! The deceitful pen of the scribes has created deceit.
\q
\v 9 The wise men will be ashamed. They are dismayed and trapped.
\q Behold! They reject Yahweh's word, so what use is their wisdom?
\q
\v 10 So I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who will possess them,
\q because from the least to the greatest, all of them are greedy for dishonest gain! From the prophet to the priest, all of them practice deceit.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues giving Jeremiah his message to the people of Judah.

  * **How can you say, "We are wise, for the law of Yahweh is with us"?** - Yahweh asks this question to make the people of Judah think about what they were saying. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "You think that you are wise because you have the law of Yahweh with you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How can you say** - The "you" here refers to the people of Judah.
  * **Indeed, see!** - These words tell the hearer to pay close attention to what follows.
  * **The deceitful pen of the scribes** - The pen represents the words that the scribes write. AT: "The false things that the scribes write" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **has created deceit** - "has given you false ideas"
  * **The wise men will be ashamed** - "Those men who think they are wise will feel ashamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **dismayed** - "terrified" or "shattered"
  * **Behold!** - "Pay attention!"
  * **so what use is their wisdom?** - This question expects a negative answer and is intended to make the hearers think about how little what they consider wisdom is really worth when they reject Yahweh's word. AT: "so what they think is wise does not do them any good." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **for from the least to the greatest, all of them are greedy for dishonest gain! From the prophet to the priest, all of them practice deceit** - Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:13|6:13]].
  * **for from the least to the greatest, all of them are greedy - The phrase "from the least to the greatest" shows that all the people of Israel are included in the phrase "all of them," regardless of how important they are. AT: "all of them, including the least powerful, the most powerful, and every one else, are greedy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **the least** - This refers to the least powerful and least important people. AT: "the least powerful people" See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **the greatest** - This refers to the most powerful and most important people. AT: "the greatest people" or "the most powerful people" See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **all of them** - "all of the people of Judah"
  * **are greedy for dishonest gain** - The abstract noun "gain" can be expressed with the phrases "get more money" or "get more things." AT: "want to get more money by lying to people" or "strongly desire to get more things and will even trick people in order to get them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * **all of them practice deceit** - "all of them deceive people" or "all of them are liars"
