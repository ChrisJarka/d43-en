\v 9 It came about the same night that Yahweh said to him, “Arise, attack the camp; for I have given you victory over it.
\v 10 But if you are afraid to attack, go first with Purah, your servant, down to the camp.
\v 11 You will hear what they say, and afterward your hands will be strengthened to attack the camp.” Then Gideon went down with Purah, his servant, to the outermost part of the soldiers who were in the camp.
