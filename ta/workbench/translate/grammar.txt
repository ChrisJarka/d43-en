====== Grammar - Important Information ======

I'm trying to make this a simple directory to the big grammar/syntax topics.

**Sentences**\\
When we speak, we organize our thoughts in sentences. A sentence usually has a complete thought about an event or a situation or state of being.

**Parts of Speech** \\ 
All words in a language belong to a category called a  part of speech.
[[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech]]

**Quotations** \\ 
A **quotation** is a report of what someone else has said. 
  * **DIRECT** quotations are when someone reports someone else’s speech the way the other person would have said it. (She said, “Come.” and then he said, “I will come.”) 
  * **INDIRECT quotations are when someone reports basically what another person said but from his own perspective (using his own words). (She told him to come. He said he would come.)
