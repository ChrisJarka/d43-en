\c 38

\v 1 In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus
says Jehovah, Set your house in order; for you shall die, and not live.
\v 2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Jehovah,
\v 3 and said, Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and
have done that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
\v 4 Then came the word of Jehovah to Isaiah, saying,
\v 5 Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus says Jehovah, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears:
behold, I will add to your days fifteen years.
\v 6 And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.
\v 7 And this shall be the sign to you from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do this thing that he has spoken:
\v 8 behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps, which is gone down on the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten
steps. So the sun returned ten steps on the dial whereon it was gone down.

\v 9 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness.
\q
\v 10 I said, In the noontide of my days I shall go into the gates of Sheol:
\q I am deprived of the residue of my years.
\q
\v 11 I said, I shall not see Jehovah, even Jehovah in the land of the living:
\q I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
\q
\v 12 My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me as a shepherdâ€™s tent:
\q I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life; he will cut me off from the loom:
\q From day even to night will you make an end of me.
\q
\v 13 I quieted myself until morning; as a lion, so he breaks all my bones:
\q From day even to night will you make an end of me.
\q
\v 14 Like a swallow or a crane, so did I chatter;
\q I did moan as a dove; mine eyes fail with looking upward:
\q O Lord, I am oppressed, be you my surety.
\q
\v 15 What shall I say? he has both spoken to me, and himself has done it:
\q I shall go softly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
\q
\v 16 O Lord, by these things men live;
\q And wholly therein is the life of my spirit:
\q Wherefore recover you me, and make me to live.
\q
\v 17 Behold, it was for my peace that I had great bitterness:
\q But you have in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;
\q For you have cast all my sins behind your back.
\q
\v 18 For Sheol cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee:
\q They that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.
\q
\v 19 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day:
\q The father to the children shall make known your truth.
\q
\v 20 Jehovah is ready to save me:
\q Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments
\q All the days of our life in the house of Jehovah.

\v 21 Now Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.
\v 22 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?
