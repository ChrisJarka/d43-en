\c 49
\p
\v 1 Of the people of Ammon. Thus says Jehovah: Hath Israel no sons? has he no heir? why then does Malcam possess Gad, and
his people dwell in the cities thereof?
\v 2 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the
people of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess
them that did possess him, says Jehovah.
