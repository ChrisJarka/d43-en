===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Pay attention and listen to my voice; be attentive and listen to my words**  - This is saying the same thing twice to urge them to pay careful attention (See: Doublet)
  * **Does a farmer who plows all day to sow, only plow the ground? Does he continually break up and harrow the field?**  - This question is intended to make them think deeply. Alternate translation: "A farmer does not plow the ground over and over.  He does not keep turning over the soil." (See: rhetorical question)
