===== Translation Notes: =====

Verse 33 concludes Wisdom's statement that began in verse 22.

    * **They will eat the fruit of their ways and with the fruit of their schemes they will be filled** - "They will eat the fruit of ther ways" and "with the fruit of their schemes they will be filled" both mean "they will experience the consequences of their actions" (UDB). The parallelism reinforces the concept. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **Those who have not been taught are killed when they turn away, and the indifference of fools will destroy them** - Both expressions mean that those who have not learned wisdom will suffer because of their foolishness.  Both expressions emphasize a willful rejection of teaching ("when they turn away" and "indifference"), and both use extreme consequences ("killed", "destroyed") to make the point. The parallelism reinforces the concept. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
