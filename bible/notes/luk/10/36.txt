===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues speaking to the man who asked how to have eternal life.)
    * **Which of these three, do you think** - This could also be translated as "What do you think? Which of these three."
    * **proved to be a neighbor** -
    * **to him who fell among the robbers** - That is, "to the man who was attacked by robbersl
    * **Now as the went on their way** - That is, "As Jesus and his disciples went on their way."
    * **he entered** - That is, "Jesus entered." This could also be translated as "Jesus and his disciples went into."
    * **who also sat at the Lord's feet**  - That is "who sat with the others at the Lord's feet." Mary was humble, respected Jesus, and assumed the position of a learner. Hence the translation should get across these ideas.
    * **heard his word**-  That is, "was listening to him"  or "was listening to what Jesus said." She gave him her attention.
