<usfm>
\v 7 These strong horses went out and sought to go and roam over the earth, so the angel said, "Go and roam over the earth!" and they left for all the earth.
\v 8 Then he called out to me and spoke to me and said, "Look at the ones that are going out to the north country; they will appease my spirit concerning the north country."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he called out to me** - "the angel called out to me"
  * **Look at the ones** - "Look at the black horses"
  * **they will appease my spirit concerning the north country** - The words "my spirit" refer to Yahweh, so many translations change this to read "Yahweh's spirit." Possible meanings are 1) the word "spirit" represents Yahweh's emotions and appeasing his spirit means that the chariots will cause Yahweh no longer to be angry with the north country AT: "they will calm my anger concerning the north country" or 2) the word "spirit" represents Yahweh's presence and the chariots will cause the Jews who live in the north land to experience Yahweh's blessings. AT: "they will cause my spirit to rest in the north country" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
