\v 4 So I sent out all of my servants the prophets to them repeatedly, for I sent them to say, ‘Quit doing these abominable things that I hate!’
\v 5 But they did not listen and would not extend their ear to return from their evil to not burn incense to other gods.
\v 6 So my fury and my wrath poured out and kindled a fire in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, so they would become a ruin, a devastation as in this day!
