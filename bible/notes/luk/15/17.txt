\v 17 Finally, after he thought clearly/carefully about what he had done, he said to himself: 'All of my father's hired servants have plenty of food much more than enough food! They have more !
\v 18 So I will leave here and go back to my father. I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God/heaven (the Greek word) and in your face/before you/in your presence.
\v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called  your son; just employ me to be like as one of the other your hired servants."'

\v 17 But when he came to himself he said, 'How many hired servants of my fatherâ€™s have more than enough food, and I perish here with hunger!
\v 18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight:
\v 19 I am no more worthy to be called your son: make me as one of your hired servants.'
