\v 1 And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 2 Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah, I remember for you the kindness of your youth, the love
of your espousals; how you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.
\v 3 Israel was holiness to Jehovah, the first fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall be held guilty;
evil shall come upon them, says Jehovah.
