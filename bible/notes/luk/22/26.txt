\v 26 But you should not be like them!

Whoever is a leader should be one who serves \add the others\add*.
\v 27 Keep in mind who is the most important one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. It is certainly the one who \add just sits\add* at the table, not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* those who serve \add the meal\add*. But I, \add your leader\add*, have been \add an example for you\add* by serving you \add while I have been\add* among you.

\v 26 But you shall not be so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that serves.
\v 27 For which is greater, he that sits at the table, or he that serves? is not he that sits at the table? but I am in the midst of you as he that serves.
