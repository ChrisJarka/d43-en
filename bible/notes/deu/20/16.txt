\v 16 But in the cities that are in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, you must kill all the people and all the animals \f + \ft litotes \f*.
\v 17 You must get rid of them completely. Get rid of the Heth people-group, the Amor people-group, the Canaan people-group, the Periz people-group, the Hiv people-group, and the Jebus people-group; that is what Yahweh our God commanded you to do.
\v 18 If you do not do that, they will teach you to sin against Yahweh our God and do the disgusting things that they do when they worship their gods.

\v 16 But of the cities of these peoples, that Jehovah your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breatheth;
\v 17 but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Jehovah your God has commanded thee;
\v 18 that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done to their gods; so would you sin against Jehovah your God.
