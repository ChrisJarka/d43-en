===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **And Jesus also said to his disciples**  - the last section was directed at Pharisees and scribes, though Jesus' disciples may have been part of the crowd listening.
    * **manager**  - that is a steward or someone who was in charge of taking care of the rich man's possessions. 
    * **squandering**  - that is, "to scatter" or, "spend foolishly". Much like the Prodigal Son, this man is wasting the wealth that he has been given.
    * **What is this I hear about you**? - This is a rhetorical question. The rich man is saying, "I have heard what you are doing."
    * **Give an account of your management**  - or, set things in order to pass on to someone else, or straighten things up to hand over.
