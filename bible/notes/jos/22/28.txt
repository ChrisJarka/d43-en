<usfm>
\v 28 In the future, if your descendants say that, our descendants can say, 'Look at the altar that our ancestors made! It is exactly like Yahweh's altar \add at Shiloh\add*, but we do not burn sacrifices on it. It only shows that we are Israelites!'
\v 29 We certainly do not want to rebel against Yahweh or stop doing what he desires, by building an altar for completely burning some sacrifices and burning grain offerings and making \add other\add* sacrifices. \add We know that\add* there is only one true altar for Yahweh our God, and it is in front of the Sacred Tent \add at Shiloh\add*."

\v 29 We certainly do not want to rebel against Yahweh or stop doing what he desires, by building an altar for completely burning some sacrifices and burning flour offerings and making other sacrifices. We know that there is only one true altar for Yahweh our God, and it is in front of the Sacred Tent at Shiloh."

\v 28 Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold
the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness
between us and you.
\v 29 Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, and turn away this day from following Jehovah, to build an altar
for burnt-offering, for grain offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle.
