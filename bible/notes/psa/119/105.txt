===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **NUN** - This is the fourteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In the Hebrew language, each line of verses 105-112 begins with this letter.
  * **is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path** - These two phrases have the same meaning and emphasize how God's word teaches him how to live. AT: "shows me how to live my life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
