\p
\v 1 Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David
this night:
\v 2 and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him
shall flee; and I will strike the king only;
\v 3 and I will bring back all the people to thee: the man whom you seek is as if all returned:
so all the people shall be in peace.
\v 4 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
