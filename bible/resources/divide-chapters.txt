====== Dividing Chapters for Translation Notes ======

(This page is in progress. Please add your comments and suggestions to the Discussion area below.)


===== Division Principles: =====

  * Remember that the passage and notes need to be able to fit the small display of a mobile phone or tablet.
  * Short chunks will be less overwhelming for novice translators to tackle, and will encourage them in the translation process by allowing them to see quick and steady progress through the project.
  * Keep sections short so that excessive scrolling will not be necessary in order to view all the notes. Ideal length would be 2-4 verses, depending on the length of the verses.
  * Use natural divisions as much as possibleâ€“clear paragraph divisions, sharp subject or location changes, etc.
  * When faced with a short passage with distinct topics, consider dividing them for clarity of explanation, even though this would result in very short chunks.
  * When faced with a passage with a single thought or argument, consider making the chunk a bit longer to include the whole thought, unless it would be unbearably long.
  * Look for occasions to include explanations of key terms and important phrases within the boundaries of a chunk.
  * Consider the theological and grammatical complexity of the verses when dividing. More complex passages should be shorter, if possible.
  * Give extra weight to the structure of the original-language text rather than to English-langauge divisions.
  * As of 07/15/14, divisions must occur at verse breaks. The software is unable to accommodate a chunk such as "3-5a."
  * Final principle: It can be fixed. Don't agonize over the divisions. They can be changed later (with some effort) if a better division is discovered during the development of the notes.


===== Suggested Process: =====

  - Insert a break before the chapter marker
  - Find and remove extraneous line breaks mid-verse that hinder scanning the text
  - Insert breaks before each paragraph marker //if// they occur a reasonable number of verses from the previous one
  - Start at the top with the first section that is too long and look for natural breaks:
    * a change in speakers
    * a change in location
    * a significant change in action
    * a jump ahead in time
  - If division is necessary, but there is no sentence break, look for a place where the sentence //could// be broken without disrupting the flow:
    * compare sentence breaks in NIV, NASB, NLT, etc.
    * insert the break mid-sentence
    * write a note in the chat section alerting the Text team to the break
