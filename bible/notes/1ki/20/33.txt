\v 33 Now the men observed diligently, and hasted to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Your brother Ben-hadad. Then
he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
\v 34 And Ben-hadad said to him, The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. And I, said Ahab, will let you go with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.
