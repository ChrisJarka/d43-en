<usfm>
\v 13 Once I saw here on this earth something that a wise man did that impressed me.
\v 14 There was a small town, where only a few people lived. The army of a great king came to that town and surrounded it. They built dirt ramps up against the walls in order to climb up and attack the town.
\v 15 In that town there was a man who was poor but very wise. Because of what that man \add suggested\add*, the town was saved; but people soon forgot about him.

\v 13 I have also seen wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me:
\v 14 There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.
\v 15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
