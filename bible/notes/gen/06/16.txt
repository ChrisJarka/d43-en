===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **deck **- the floor of a ship. The ark had three different levels or compartments like a building of three stories.
  * **"deck" - **  the floor of a ship. The ark had 3 interior decks, or alternatively, 3 layers of living space, or 3 levels of rooms, or 3 stories (as in a building). I posted this Translation Note because while the above definition of "deck" is true, I felt It needs added accuracy and alternate translations.
  * **all flesh**  - While the primary focus is on human beings, animal life is also included.
  * **Listen**  - In this verse, "listen" is used to emphasize the certainty, communicated by God, of his commitment to destroy the earth in a flood. Alternate, "heed my words" or "pay attention"
  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **make a roof for the boat**  - This is an actual peaked roof. It is not designed to be walked on, only to protect the occupants and shed weather (water). This is in contrast to normal boats where<font 14px line-height: 19px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>the</font>    <font 14px line-height: 19px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>top deck of a boat is outside and forms the roof of</font>    <font 14px line-height: 19px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>the interior deck</font>    <font 14px line-height: 19px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>below.</font>
