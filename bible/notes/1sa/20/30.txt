\v 30 Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I
know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?
\v 31 For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the ground, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Wherefore now
send and fetch him to me, for he shall surely die.
