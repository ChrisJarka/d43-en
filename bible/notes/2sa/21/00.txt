====== 2 Samuel 21 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

There are two very different stories in the chapter. 1-17 is the story of the famine and 18-22 is the stories of the Israelis killing Philistine giants.  

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Famine cause by a broken oath ==
When Israel first conquered the land they promised not to kill the people of Gibeon. But Saul tried to kill them all. So God sent a famine on Israel. David asked the people of Gibeon what they wanted so they would pray for Israel. They said they want 7 of Saul's descendants. They hung them from a tree. One of Saul's wives protected the bodies day and night from birds or animals until the drought was over. Then David took those bodies and the bones of Saul and Jonathan and buried them all in Saul's father's tomb.

== The Giants of Gath killed ==
Israel and the Philistines had several other war and David's soldiers killed seven giants from  the town of Gath.
