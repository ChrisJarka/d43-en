\v 18 But the glory is that God fitted each part of the body, and it works just as he designed it. No part is indespensible. Every part is needed.
\v 19 If each of us were exactly like all the other parts, we wouldn't have a body at all.
\v 20 The work of the Spirit of God makes each of us, as individual members of the body, and he makes each of the members into a unified and whole body, that has everything it needs.
