<usfm> \v 9 Human minds are extremely corrupt\f + \ft Or: deceitful \f*, \q2 and we cannot change that. \q2 It is also completely impossible \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* for anyone to understand that. \b \q1 \v 10 But I, Yahweh, search what is in everyone's inner being, \q2 and I examine what they are thinking. \q1 I will give all people rewards, \q2 what they deserve for what they have done." \b \q1 \v 11 \add I, Jeremiah, agree, because I know that\add* people who become rich by doing things that are unjust \q2 are like birds that hatch eggs that they did not lay\f + \ft Or: stole from another nest \f*. \q1 So, when those people have lived only half of the years \add that they expect to live\add*, their wealth will disappear. \q2 Then \add other people will realize that\add* those rich people have been foolish. \b \q1 </usfm>

<usfm> \v 9 Human minds are extremely corrupt, \q2 and we cannot change that. \q2 It is also completely impossible for anyone to understand that. \b \q1 \v 10 But I, Yahweh, search what is in everyone's inner being, \q2 and I examine what they are thinking. \q1 I will give all people reward or punishment, \q2 what they deserve for what they have done." \b \q1 \v 11 I know some people who become rich by doing things that are unjust. \q2 They are like birds that hatch eggs that they did not lay. \q1 So, when those people have lived only half of the years that they expect to live, they will disappear. \q2 Then other people will realize that those people have been foolish. \b

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \q \v 9 The heart is more deceitful than anything else. It is sick; who can understand it? \q \v 10 I am Yahweh, the one who searches through the mind, who tests the heart. \q I give to each person what he deserves, punishing him for the fruit of his deeds. \q \v 11 A partridge hatches an egg that she did not lay. Someone may become rich unjustly; \q but in his prime of life, those riches will abandon him; he will be a fool in the end." </usfm>
