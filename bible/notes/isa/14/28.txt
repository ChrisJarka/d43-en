\v 28 In the year that king Ahaz died this oracle came.
\v 29 Do not rejoice, O Philistia, because the rod that struck you is broken. For out of the serpentâ€™s root will
come forth an adder, and his offspring will be a fiery flying serpent.
\v 30 The firstborn of the poor will feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety.  I will kill your root with famine
that will put to death all your survivers.
