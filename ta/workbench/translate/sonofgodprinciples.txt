1. **The names Father and Son are chosen by God himself and revealed in the Bible, the word of God.**
>Jesus said, "I praise you __Father__, Lord of heaven and earth,... no one knows the __Son__ except the __Father__, and no one knows the __Father__ except the __Son__..." (Matthew 11:25-27 ULB) (See also: John 6:26-57 ULB)
Theologians have found the terms 'Father' and 'Son' to be irreplaceable, because any other terms end up suggesting incorrect things about God. No one should try to replace them in translation.

2. **The words "Father" and "Son" show God's Persons exist in an __eternal__, infinite, loving relationship.**
>"__The Father loves the Son__." (John 3:35-36; 5:19-20 ULB)

>Jesus said, "__Father__, __glorify your Son__ so that __the Son may glorify you__... I glorified you on the earth,... Now Father, glorify me... with the glory that __I had with you before the world was created__." (John 17:1-5 ULB)

Father, Son, and Spirit have eternally loved one another, so human fathers and sons should too. 

3. **God’s Father-Son relationship was created into humanity as part of the image of God in mankind.**
>"God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness...' God created man in his own image... Male and female..." (Genesis 1:26 ULB)

>"This is my commandment, that you should love one another as I have loved you." (John 15:12 ULB)

>"God deals with you as with sons, for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?... Should we not... obey the Father of spirits and live?" (Hebrews 12:7-9 ULB)

>"Children, obey your parents in the Lord... 'Honor your father and mother'... fathers, do not provoke your children to anger… raise them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord." (Ephesians 6:1-4 ULB)

The language chosen by God to describe his Persons is chosen according to God's characteristics, not man's. Human fathers and sons, and man's limited ability to generate life, exist because God created humanity in his image. 'Father' and 'Son' language describing God’s Persons originates from the realities of God, not from any need to mirror human realities. 

God has chosen to reveal himself through normal family relationships. We cannot fully understand the depths of the relationship between God the Father and God the Son, but by translating with words that best represent the relationship between human fathers and sons, God speaks in the way he has chosen.

4. **Human father-son relationships are fallen and imperfect.**

Yahweh saw that the wickedness of mankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually. (Genesis 6:5 ULB)
>"... both Jews and Greeks, all of them, [are] under sin, as it is written, 'There is none righteous, not one. There is none who understands. There is none who seeks after God. They have all turned away, they together have become useless. There is none who does good, no, not as many as one… There is no fear of God before their eyes… For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.' " (Romans 3:9-23 ULB)

Normal human father-son relationships during the times of the Bible were never as intimate, loving or perfect as the relationship between Jesus and his Father. But, the translator should not shy away from these God-selected terms because of cultural or family problems. The words "Father" and "Son" allow God to speak to us and correct and guide our understanding of who God is and has always been. The Bible uses common, normal words for "Father" and "Son," like the English "father" and "son." Choose words in your language that are widely used and refer to a human "father" and his human "son." 

5. **The eternal Son humbled himself 2000 years ago. Jesus' mother was Mary, but his father was God.**
>"Then Mary said, 'How will this happen, since I am a virgin?' The angel answered her, 'The __Holy Spirit__ will come over you and the power of the __Most High__ will overshadow you. Therefore, the holy one who will be born will be called the __Son of God__.' " (Luke 1:34-35 ULB)

>"__Christ Jesus__... did not consider his __equality with God__ as something to hold on to. But instead he emptied himself... in the likeness of men he humbled himself... to the death of the cross." (Philippians 2:5-8 ULB)\\  
Christ is termed "son of the Most High" because the Holy Spirit miraculously placed him in Mary's womb, introducing his temporal mission to be born as a human and provide salvation for humanity.

6. **God the Father adopts believers in Christ as his 'sons'.**
>…God sent his Son…that we might receive adoption as sons. Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls, "Abba, Father." (Galatians 4:4-6)

>"God so loved the world, that he gave __his only unique Son__, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. God did not send the __Son__... to condemn the world, but so that the world should be saved... He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been condemned already because he has not believed __in the name of the unique Son of God__." (John 3:16-18 ULB)

>"God... sent his own __Son__... to be an offering for sin, and he condemned sin in the flesh." (Romans 8:3 ULB)

>"... we were reconciled to God through the death of his __Son__,... saved by his life." (Romans 5:10 ULB) 

7. **The terms 'Father' and 'Son' cannot be replaced by any other terms without suggesting incorrect things about God. No one should try to replace them in translation.**\\

God is eternally 'Father', 'Son', and 'Spirit.' The existence of fathers and sons in humanity is not the reason God describes himself with a 'Father' and a 'Son'. Instead, God created humanity to have fathers and sons because God himself is Father, Son, and Spirit. God did not choose the descriptors 'Father' and 'Son' to use our families to illustrate Himself. Instead, God created us in His image, including fathers bringing forth sons, to illustrate His eternal being and the loving fellowship of His Persons.

Therefore, it is necessary to chose the same terms for God 'the Father' and 'Son' that are revealed to humanity in God's word, the Bible. God himself is the source of this terminology, not man. These terms must be translated literally, which means the translator must use words in his language to translate Father and Son as described in point number 4 above, words in your language that are widely used and refer to a human "father" and his human "son."
