\v 10 The wheels were all alike: Each had one wheel inside another wheel.
\v 11 Whenever they moved, they went straight in whatever direction one of the winged creatures faced. The wheels did not turn in another direction while the winged creatures flew.

\p
\v 9 So I looked, and behold! Four wheels were beside the cherubim—one wheel beside each cherub—and the appearance of the 
wheels was like a beryl stone.
\v 10 They appeared in the same likeness for all four of them, like a wheel intersecting another wheel.
\v 11 When they moved, they went in any direction; they did not turn when they moved since they moved to the place where
the head faced. They did not turn when they moved.
