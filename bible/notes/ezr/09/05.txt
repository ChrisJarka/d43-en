\v 5 When it was time to offer those sacrifices, I was still sitting there, wearing those torn clothes and mourning\f + \ft Or: sad \f*. I stood up, and then I quickly prostrated myself on the ground. I lifted up my hands to Yahweh, my God,
\v 6 and this is what I prayed:
\pi "Yahweh my God, I am very ashamed to raise my head in front of you. The sins that we Israelites have committed \add are very great; it is as though they\add* have risen up higher than our heads, and our guilt \add for committing those sins, it is as though it\add* rises up to the heavens.

\p
\v 5 And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe rent; and I fell upon my
knees, and spread out my hands to Jehovah my God;
\v 6 and I said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increased over our
head, and our guiltiness is grown up to the heavens.
