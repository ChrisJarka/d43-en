\v 22 Do not carry loads out of your houses or do any other work on Sabbath days! Instead, cause Sabbath days to be holy\f + \ft Or: set apart for me \f*. I commanded your ancestors to do that,

<usfm>
\v 21 Thus says Jehovah, Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of
Jerusalem;
\v 22 neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do you any work: but hallow you the sabbath
day, as I commanded your fathers.
\v 23 But they listened not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not
receive instruction.
