==== Description ====

A metaphor occurs when someone speaks of something as if it were something else because there is something that they have in common. That is, in some way one is like the other. The thing he speaks of is called the **topic**.  The thing he calls it is the **image**. 

1. Sometimes the **topic** and the **image** are both stated clearly. 

>Jesus said to them. â€œ__I am the bread of life__. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who trusts in me will never be thirsty." (John 6:35 

Jesus called himself the bread of life. The topic is "I" and the image is "bread." Bread is a food that people ate all the time. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to trust in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.

2. Sometimes only the **image** is stated clearly.

>Produce fruits that are worthy of repentance (Luke 3:8)

The image here is "fruits". The topic is not stated, but it is actions or behavior. Trees can produce good fruit or bad fruit, and people can produce good behavior or bad behavior. Fruits that are worthy of repentance are good behavior that is appropriate for people who have repented.

=== Purposes of Metaphor ===

  * One purpose of metaphor is to teach people about something that they do not know (the **topic**) by showing that it is like something that they already know (the **image**).
  * Another purpose  is to emphasize that something has a particular quality or to show that it has that quality in an extreme way.
  * Another purpose is to lead people to feel the same way about one thing as they would feel toward another.
  * Often metaphors are the favorite way for speakers of a language to talk about something. For example, when English speakers talk about the amount of something changing, they often say that it is going up or down. ("The literacy rate is going up." "The price of bread has gone down.") Many other languages require their speakers to say these things in other ways.

=== Reasons this could is a translation issue  ===
  * People may not realize that that a word is being used as a image in a metaphor.
  * People may not be familiar with the thing that is used as an image. 
  * If the topic is not stated, people may not know what the topic is.
  * People may not know why the metaphor is used. That is, they may not know how the topic and the image are alike.

=== Translation Principles  ===
  * 
  * Do not make the meaning of a metaphor more clear to the target audience than it was to the original audience.
  * Do not make a metaphor sound more novel to the target audience than it was to the original audience.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>__I am the good shepherd__. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. (John 10:11 ULB)

In the metaphor above, the topic is "I" and the image is "the good shepherd." Jesus called himself the good shepherd. A good shepherd saves the lives of his sheep even if it would put his own life in danger. Jesus wanted to save his people and would die in order to do it.

>Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of __the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees__." The disciples reasoned among themselves and said, "It is because we took no bread." (Matthew 16:6-7 ULB)

Jesus used a metaphor, but his disciples did not realize it. When he said "yeast," they thought he was talking about bread, but "yeast" was the image in his metaphor about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Since the disciples did not understand what Jesus meant, it would not be good to state clearly here what Jesus meant.


==== Translation Strategies ====
If people would understand the metaphor correctly, consider using it. If not, here are some other strategies.

  - If the target audience would not know the **image**, or if the image is not used in the same way, use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. 
  - If the target audience would not know the **image**, simply state the truth that the metaphor was used to communicate. For example, "the children of Jerusalem" ([[en:bible:notes:luk:13:34]]) could be restated as "the people living in Jerusalem."
  - If the topic is not stated clearly in the original, and if it would also be unclear to your readers, state the topic clearly. However, do not do this if the topic was not clear to the original audience. For example, in Matthew 16:6, Jesus told his disciples "Beware of the __yeast__  of the Pharisees and Sadducees." His disciples thought he was talking about bread, but Jesus was warning them about the __teaching__  of the Pharisees and Sadducees. That was the topic, but it was unstated, and the disciples did not understand it at first. If the metaphor were fully stated, it would be, "The teaching of the Pharisees is like yeast." This sentence would communicate the fact that both teachings and yeast spread throughout whatever they touch and change it.
  - If the target audience would not understand the metaphor, then change the metaphor to a simile by adding "like" or "as."
  - If the biblical metaphor seems to be a normal way for the biblical language to say something, then use the normal way that your language says it. For example, "[Stephen] fell asleep" (en:bible:notes:act:07:59) can be translated, "Stephen died."
