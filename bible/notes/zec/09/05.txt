<usfm>
\v 5 Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be sore pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to
shame; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
\v 6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
\v 7 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he also shall be a
remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
