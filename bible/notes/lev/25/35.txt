\v 35 And if your brother be waxed poor, and his hand fail with thee; then you shall uphold him: as a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee.
\v 36 Take you no interest of him or increase, but fear your God; that your brother may live with thee.
\v 37 You shall not give him your money upon interest, nor give him your food for increase.
\v 38 I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.
