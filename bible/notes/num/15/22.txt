<usfm>
\v 22 There may be times when you Israelites do not obey all these instructions that I have given to Moses to tell you, but not because you intended to disobey them.
\v 23 There may be times when some of your descendants do not obey all these instructions that I have given to Moses to tell to you.
\v 24 If you or they sin \add by forgetting to obey these instructions\add* and none of the Israelite people realize that they were doing that, one young bull as an offering for all the people \add must be brought to the priest\add*. That will be pleasing to me \add when it is burned on the altar\add*. They must also bring to me a grain offering and an offering of wine, and a male goat, to be sacrificed to remove the guilt of their sin.

\v 22 When you sin without intending to sin and do not obey all these commandments that Yahweh has spoken to Moses,
\v 23 everything that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses from the day that Yahweh commanded you and onward for this and future generations,
\v 24 then it will be for sin done unintentionally, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation must offer one young bull for a burnt offering for a sweet aroma to Yahweh, along with its grain offering and drink offering ordered by the decree, and one male goat for a sin offering.
