=== What is the Book of Jonah about? ===

The book of Jonah is a biographical narrative, with purpose of showing the inclusion of Gentiles in the mercy and grace of Yahweh, and their ability to respond to warnings with true [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]] and worship of Yahweh. He was given a mission to take a warning and to call the people of Nineveh to repentance, or Yahweh would destroy their city. Jonah, as a loyalist to Israel, chose not to do what Yahweh called him to do, and he ran away. Jonah was a patriot to the nation of Israel (living in the Northern Kingdom, with Samaria as the chief city), and he did not want Gentiles to be shown grace. Jonah desired for Nineveh to fall because they were an enemy of Israel). Despite this, Yahweh sent him to Nineveh to call them to repent and to worship Yahweh.


=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may decided to translate this traditional title "The book of Jonah" in a way that is more clear to the readers. They may decide to call it, "The book about Jonah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]).

=== Who wrote the Book of Jonah? ===

The author of the Book of Jonah is unknown. The prophet Jonah is mentioned in 2 Kings 14:25. He lived in the northern kingdom in the 8th century BC, during the time of King Jeroboam II. 


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== How are Jonah and Elijah connected? ===

There are many parallels between Jonah and the prophets Elijah and Elisha that should be studied. Each of these was sent to Gentile nations, Elijah to Sidon;  Elisha to Syria; and Jonah to Nineveh. Notice that Elijah and Jonah both suffered depression after their greatest victories. Elijah and Jonah both delivered messages that were more about destruction and defeat than about the grace of Yahweh. Elijah’s message from in 1 Kings 17:1b, “As Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there will not be dew or rain these years unless I say so.” See also Jonah’s message from Jonah 3:4b. “In forty days and Nineveh will be overthrown.” The oracles of Elijah and Jonah are surprisingly short and punctuated with an unspoken desire that their prophecies not be followed or that they bring terrible results to those who hear the message. The message of grace to the Gentiles is central to the New Testament message.

=== Who was Assyria? ===

During the time of Jonah, Assyria was the most powerful kingdom in the world. It was known for its ruthlessness. Eventually, God punished Assyria for its sin.

=== Did Assyria convert to Judaism? ===

While it is possible that the Assyrians came to worship Yahweh alone, it is likely that they continued to worship other [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]].


=== Why is Yahweh concerned with a foreign nation? ===

God shows [[:en:obe:kt:mercy|mercy]] to Assyria and Jonah implies that Assyria will use this mercy to destroy the nation of Israel. Jonah struggles with this greatly. What he fails to see is that God's mercy towards the nation of Israel exceeds the mercy shown to Assyria. The reaction the people of Assyria to the prophet of Israel is repentance. This is the reaction the people of Israel should have had to their own prophets. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Is Jonah written as narrative or a parable? ===

Some people believe that the book of Jonah is a myth, fable or allegory. It is best for the translator to use language that treats the text as if the events actually happened. The writing style should follow a more narrative quality.

=== Did a "whale" or "big fish" swallow Jonah? ===

For many years, English translations used the word "whale," but it is better to use the term "big fish."
