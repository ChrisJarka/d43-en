====== Background Information ======

===== Description =====

Occasionally an author may take a break from the storyline to share something of interest. This break usually contains background information. An author may use background information for several reasons:

  * To add interest to the story.
  * To provide important historical or cultural information.
  * To tell the reader, or listener, something very important

Notes should follow this format:

===== Bible Examples =====

=== Act:08:09 ===

"But there was a certain man in the city named Simon, who had earlier been practicing sorcery; he used to astonish the people of Samaria, while claiming that he was an important person."

  * **the city**  - "the city in Samaria." "in Samaria" is background information. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:writingstyles|Writing Styles - Background Information]])
=== Gen:16:16 ===

"Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram."

  * **Abram was**  - This introduces background information about Abram's age when these things happened. Your language may have a special way to mark background information. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:writingstyles|Writing Styles - Background Information]])
=== Luk:03:23 ===

"Now Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years of age. He was the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, "

  * **Jesus himself**  - "this Jesus" or "this person Jesus." This is immediately followed by background information about Jesus. If your language has a way of showing that what follows is background information, you should use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:writingstyles|Writing Styles - Background Information]])
