\v 13 Specifically, all the military guards who are stationed here in Rome and many other  because I proclaim the good news about Christ.
\v 14 Also, most of the believers here now proclaim the message from God more courageously and fearlessly because they trust the Lord more firmly to help them. They trust the Lord more because they have seen how the Lord has helped me while I have been a prisoner  here.

\v 12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have advanced the progress of the gospel.
\v 13This was so because my bonds in Christ became known throughout the whole palace, and to everyone else.
\v 14 And also so that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my imprisonment, speak the word of God with more boldness and without fear.
