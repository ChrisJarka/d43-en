\v 9 But then I will turn to people of a pure language, to call all of them in the name of Yahweh to serve me with
one accord.  [[I wish there was away to maintain the “one shoulder” of the Heb., since it accords well with being yoked in Jesus’ NT expressions.]]
\v 10 From beyond the river of Ethiopia my worshipers--my scattered daughter--will bring my offering.
\v 11 In that day you will not be put to shame for all your deeds that you transgressed against me, since at that time I will
remove from your midst those of you who celebrated your pride and you will no longer act arrogantly on my holy mountain.
