\v 7 But \add because I do not want to have to punish you\add*, I am praying to God that he will help you not to do anything evil \add that would cause me to have to punish you. I pray this\add*, not in order that when people \add who say that I am not your apostle\add* realize \add that my ministry among you has been very successful, they will have to agree\add* that I do have authority from Christ. Instead, \add I pray this because I want\add* you to do what is right, even though that might mean that \add my opponents would think\add* that I do not have authority from Christ, \add since I would not have an opportunity to show my authority to discipline you\add*.
\v 8 \add If you do what is right, I will not discipline you\add*, \add because it would\add* not\add be right for me to do that if you are conducting your lives the way you should, like\add* God's true \add message says that you should. What God asks me to do is to help people to know and obey his\add* true \add message\add*.

\v 7 But because I do not want to have to punish you, I am praying to God that he will help you not to do anything evil that would cause me to have to punish you. I pray this, not in order that when people who say that I am not your apostle realize that my ministry among you has been very successful, they will have to agree that I do have authority from Christ. Instead, I pray this because I want you to do what is right, even though that might mean that my opponents would think that I do not have authority from Christ, since I would not have an opportunity to show my authority to discipline you.
\v 8 If you do what is right, I will not discipline you, because it would notbe right for me to do that if you are conducting your lives the way you should, like God's true message says that you should. What God asks me to do is to help people to know and obey his true message.

\v 7 Now we pray to God that you do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is honorable, though we be as reprobate.
\v 8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
