====== Galatians 06:14-16 ======

<usfm>
\v 14 I myself, however, strongly desire that I never boast about anything like that. The only thing I will boast about is what our Lord Jesus Christ accomplished by dying on the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Because of what Christ did on the cross, I no longer am interested in the things that those who do not trust Christ \f + \ft metonymy \f* think are important, and those people are no longer interested in the things that I \f + \ft metaphor \f* think are important.
\v 15 I will boast about Christ dying on the cross because God is concerned neither that people are circumcised nor that people are not circumcised. Instead, he is concerned only that people conduct their lives in a completely new way.
\v 16 I pray that God will give inner peace and act kindly towards all who will act according to this new way of life. It is all those who live according to this new way of life who are now truly God's people \f + \ft metaphor \f*, as the Israelite people were God's people previously.

\v 14 Be it far from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.
\v 15 For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, rather a new creation.
\v 16 As many as shall walk by this rule peace and mercy be on them, and on the Israel of God.
