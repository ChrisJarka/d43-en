===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 So, do not pay attention to your \add false\add* prophets and fortune-tellers and people who predict what will happen by working magic or by talking with spirits of dead people. Those people say that the king of Babylon will not conquer your country.
\v 10 Those people are all liars. \add If you believe what they say\add*, it will result in your being exiled from your land. I will cause you to be taken from your land, and you will die far away.
\v 11 But the people of any country who do what the king of Babylon wants them to do will remain in their own country and be able to plant their crops \f + \ft metonymy \f* as they always have done. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it."

\v 9 But as for you, listen you not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayours, nor to
your sorcerers, that speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon:
\v 10 for they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and you should
perish.
\v 11 But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that
nation will I let remain in their own land, says Jehovah; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
