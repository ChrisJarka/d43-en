\v 2 Then Yahweh replied to me,
\q1 "Write plainly on tablets \add what I am revealing to you in\add* this vision,

\q1
\v 3 In this vision \add I will be talking about things that will happen\add* in the future.
\q1 Now is not the time when those things will happen,

\v 2 Yahweh answered me and said,
\q "Record this vision, and write plainly on the tablets so that the one reading them might run.
\q
\v 3 For the vision is yet for a future time and will finally speak and not fail.
\q Though it delays, wait for it. For it will surely come and will not tarry.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh answers Habakkuk.

  * **Record this vision, and write plainly on the tablets** - Both of these phrases are saying the same thing in two different ways. AT: "Write this vision clearly on the tablets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **tablets** - These are flat pieces of stone or clay that were used for writing.
  * **so that the one reading them might run** - Possible meanings are 1) that the message is easy enough to read that a messenger can read it as he runs from place to place proclaiming the message. AT: "so that the one reading the tablets might be able to run as he reads" or 2) this is a metaphor in which Yahweh speaks of reading something very quickly as if the person who reads it is running. AT: "so that the one reading the tablets might be able to read quickly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the vision ... will finally speak** - Yahweh speaks of the events in the vision happening as if the vision were a person who speaks. AT: "the vision ... will finally happen" or "the vision ... will finally come true" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Though it delays, wait for it. For it will surely come and will not tarry** - Yahweh speaks of the events of the vision taking a long time to happen as if the vision were a person who does not arrive soon at his destination. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **will not tarry** - Possible meanings are 1) "will not be late" or 2) "will not come slowly"
