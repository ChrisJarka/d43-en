\nb
\v 1 And so, working together, we urge you not to receive the grace of God to no effect.  
\v 2 For he says,
\q In a favorable time I paid attention to you,
\q And in the day of salvation I helped you.
\m Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
\v 3 We certainly do not want to give anyone reason to do what is wrong, that no one may blame our ministry,
