\v 4 Then one of Sennacherib's important officials told them to take this message to Hezekiah:
\p "This is what the king of Assyria, the great king, says: What are you trusting in to rescue you?
\v 5 You say that you have weapons to fight us and some country's promises \add to help you\add*, \add and that will enable you to defeat us\add*, but than is only talk \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. Who do you think will help you to rebel against my \add soldiers from Assyria\add*?
\v 6 Listen to me! You are relying on \add the army of\add* Egypt. But that will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* using a broken reed for a walking stick on which you could lean. But it would pierce the hand of anyone who would lean on it! That is what the king of Egypt would be like for anyone who relied on him \add for help\add*.
\v 7 But perhaps you will say to me, 'No, we are relying on Yahweh our God \add to help us\add*'.' \add I would reply\add*, 'Is he not the one whom \add you insulted by\add* tearing down his shrines and altars and forcing everyone in Jerusalem and \add other places in\add* Judah to worship only in front of the altar \add in Jerusalem\add*?'

\v 4 Then one of Sennacherib's important officials told them to take a message to Hezekiah
\p from the king of Assyria, the great king. In the message, the king said to the people of Jerusalem, "What are you trusting in to rescue you?
\v 5 You say that you have weapons to fight us and that some other nation has promised to help you, but that is only talk. Who do you think will help you to rebel against my soldiers from Assyria?
\v 6 Listen to me! You are relying on the army of Egypt. But that is like when a man tries to walk while leaning on a broken reed for a walking stick. But it would pierce the hand of anyone who would lean on it! That is what the king of Egypt is like for anyone who relies on him for help.
\v 7 But perhaps you will say to me that you are relying on Yahweh your God to help you. In that case, I would answer that Yahweh is the one whom Hezekiah insulted by tearing down his shrines and altars and forcing everyone in Jerusalem and other places in Judah to worship only in front of the altar in Jerusalem."

\v 4 The the chief commander said to them, "Tell Hezekiah that the great king, the king of Assyria, says, 'What is the source of your confidence? 
\v 5 You speak only useless words, saying there is counsel and strength for war. Now in whom are you trusting? Who has given you courage to rebel against me?


\v 6 Look, you trust in the walking stick of this bruised reed of Egypt, but if a man leans it will stick into his hand and pierce it. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt is to anyone who trusts in him.
\v 7 But if you say to me, "We are trusting in Yahweh our God," is not he the one whose shrines and altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem?"
