\d For the Chief Musician; set to Jonath elem rehokim. A Psalm
of David. Michtam: when the Philistines took him in Gath.
\q
\v 1 Be merciful to me, O God; for man would swallow me up:
\q All the day long he fighting oppresseth me.
\q
\v 2 Mine enemies would swallow me up all the day long;
\q For they are many that fight proudly against me.
\q
\v 3 What time I am afraid,
\q I will put my trust in thee.
\q
\v 4 In God (I will praise his word),
\q In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid;
\q What can flesh do to me?
\q
\v 5 All the day long they wrest my words:
\q All their thoughts are against me for evil.
\q
\v 6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves,
\q They mark my steps,
\q Even as they have waited for my soul.
\q
\v 7 Shall they escape by iniquity?
\q In anger cast down the peoples, O God.
\q
\v 8 You numberest my wanderings:
\q Put you my tears into your bottle;
\q Are they not in your book?
\q
\v 9 Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call:
\q This I know, that God is for me.
\q
\v 10 In God (I will praise his word),
\q In Jehovah (I will praise his word),
\q
\v 11 In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid;
\q What can man do to me?
\q
\v 12 Your vows are upon me, O God:
\q I will render thank-offerings to thee.
\q
\v 13 For you have delivered my soul from death:
\q Hast you not delivered my feet from falling,
\q That I may walk before God
\q In the light of the living?
