\v 4 \add From now until he is born\add*, you must not drink any wine or other alcoholic\f + \ft Or: fermented \f* drink, and you must not eat any food that will make you unacceptable to God.
\v 5 Actually, you are already pregnant. After you give birth to your son, you must never allow his hair to be cut. He must be dedicated to God from the day he is born until the day he dies. He is the one who will rescue the Israelite people from the people of Philistia."

\v 5 You will become pregnant. After you give birth to your son, no one may ever cut his hair. He will be dedicated to God even before he is born until the day he dies. He will begin the work that will rescue Israel from the power of the Philistines."

\v 3 The angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman and said to her, "See now, you have been unable to become pregnant, and you have not given birth, but you will become pregnant and you will give birth to a son.
\v 4 Now be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean.
\p 
\v 5 Look, you will become pregnant and give birth to a son. No razor will be used upon his head, for the child will be a Nazirite dedicated to God from the womb. He will begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines."
