\v 5 And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have
dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
\v 6 And at the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the
king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm;
but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that became the father of her, and he that strengthened her in those times.
