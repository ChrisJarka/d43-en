\v 14 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*,
\v 15 "When you sin, without intending to, by not giving to Yahweh the things that you are required to give to him, you must pay a penalty by bringing to Yahweh a ram that has no defects. You must determine how much silver it is worth, by using the official standard in the temple. It will be an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty.
\v 16 But you must also make restitution for what you failed to give to Yahweh, adding one-fifth of its value. You must give that to the priest. He will offer the ram as a sacrifice for the sin that you have committed and cause you to no longer be guilty; and you will be forgiven.

You must determine how much silver it is worth, by using the official standard in the sacred tent. It will be an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty.
\v 16 But you must also make restitution for what you failed to give to Yahweh, adding one-fifth (twenty percent) of its value. You must give that to the priest. He will offer the ram as a sacrifice for the sin that you have committed and cause you to no longer be guilty, and you will be forgiven.

\v 14 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 15 "If any one violates a command and sins but is not aware of it regarding anything commanded to be set apart for Yahweh, then he must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish from the flock with its worth accounted in silver shekels, after the shekel of the tabernacle, for a guilt offering.
\v 16 He must satisfy Yahweh for violating what is set apart as holy to him, and he must add a fifth to it (twenty percent) and give it to the priest. Then the priest will make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he will be forgiven.
