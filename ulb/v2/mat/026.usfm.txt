\c 26
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,
\v 2 You know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.
\v 3 Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, to the court of the high priest, who was
called Caiaphas;
\v 4 and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.
\v 5 But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among the people.
\p
\v 6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
\v 7 there came to him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as
he sat at meat.
\v 8 But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?
\v 9 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
\v 10 But Jesus perceiving it said to them, Why trouble you the woman? for she has wrought a good work upon me.
\v 11 For you have the poor always with you; but me you have not always.
\v 12 For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
\v 13 Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman has done
shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
\p
\v 14 Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
\v 15 and said, What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they weighed to him thirty pieces of
silver.
\v 16 And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him to them.

\p
\v 17 Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where will you that we make
ready for you to eat the passover?
\v 18 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover
at your house with my disciples.
\v 19 And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
\p
\v 20 Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples;
\v 21 and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.
\v 22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say to him every one, Is it I, Lord?
\v 23 And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
\v 24 The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good
were it for that man if he had not been born.
\v 25 And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He says to him, You have said.
\p
\v 26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat;
this is my body.
\v 27 And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink you all of it;
\v 28 for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many to remission of sins.
\v 29 But I say to you, I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you
in my Fatherâ€™s kingdom.
\p
\v 30 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
\p
\v 31 Then says Jesus to them, All you shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and
the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
\v 32 But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.
\v 33 But Peter answered and said to him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.
\v 34 Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, that this night, before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.
\v 35 Peter says to him, Even if I must die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the
disciples.
\p
\v 36 Then comes Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and says to his disciples, Sit you here, while I go yonder
and pray.
\v 37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.
\v 38 Then says he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death: abide you here, and watch with me.
\v 39 And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass
away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as you wilt.
\v 40 And he comes to the disciples, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, What, could you not watch with me one
hour?
\v 41 Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
\v 42 Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, your will be
done.
\v 43 And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
\v 44 And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.
\v 45 Then comes he to the disciples, and says to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and
the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\v 46 Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrays me.
\p
\v 47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from
the chief priests and elders of the people.
\v 48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.
\v 49 And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.
\v 50 And Jesus said to him, Friend, do that for which you are come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and
took him.
\v 51 And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the
high priest, and struck off his ear.
\v 52 Then says Jesus to him, Put up again your sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the
sword.
\v 53 Or think you that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?
\v 54 How then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
\v 55 In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are you come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat
daily in the temple teaching, and you took me not.
\v 56 But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him,
and fled.
\p
\v 57 And they that had taken Jesus led him away to the house of
Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
\v 58 But Peter followed him afar off, to the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the
end.
\v 59 Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;
\v 60 and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two,
\v 61 and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
\v 62 And the high priest stood up, and said to him, Answerest you nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
\v 63 But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether
you are the Christ, the Son of God.
\v 64 Jesus says to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Henceforth you shall see the Son of man sitting at the
right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.
\v 65 Then the high priest tore his garments, saying, He has spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold,
now you have heard the blasphemy:
\v 66 what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.
\v 67 Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some struck him with the palms of their hands,
\v 68 saying, Prophesy to us, you Christ: who is he that struck thee?
\p
\v 69 Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came to him, saying, You also was with Jesus the Galilaean.
\v 70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what you sayest.
\v 71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and says to them that were there, This man
also was with Jesus of Nazareth.
\v 72 And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.
\v 73 And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth you also are
one of them; for your speech makes you known.
\v 74 Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.
\v 75 And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice. And he went out, and
wept bitterly.
