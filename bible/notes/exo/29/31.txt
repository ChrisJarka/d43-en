<usfm> \p \v 31 You must take the ram for the consecration of the priests to me and boil its meat in a holy place. \v 32 Aaron and his sons must eat the ram's meat and the bread that is in the basket at the entrance to the tent of meeting. \v 33 They must eat the meat and bread that were given to atone for them and to consecrate them to serve me. No one else may eat that food, because they must treat it as consecrated to me, reserved for me. \v 34 If any of the meat of the consecration offering or any of the bread, remains to the next morning, then you must burn it. It must not be eaten because it has been consecrated—reserved—for me. </usfm>
