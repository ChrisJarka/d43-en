==== Introduction to the Audio Manual ====

The unfoldingWord Audio Manual is created to be a helpful companion for your audio projects, training and equipping you in the basic skills and wisdom you need to carry a project from start to finish.

We have divided the manual into modules focused on various aspects of audio work. The principles, standards, skills, recommendations and guides are carefully selected and continually evaluated to identify the best practices and optimized equipment for recording and for effective distribution of Biblical content in real-world conditions.

This manual will be revised and updated occasionally. You can always find the latest version at https://unfoldingword.org.
