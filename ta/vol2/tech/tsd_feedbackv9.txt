The Feedback option can be used for three major reasons:
    * Reporting errors
    * Asking questions about the program
    * Making suggestions about the program

=== Reporting Errors ===

Sometimes translationStudio may not work as expected.

At times the program may restart, also called a 'crash'. This is most likely not because of what the translator did. When this happens, the **Feedback** window will open and a request to type into the space an explanation of what was being done just before the program restarted.

=== Asking Questions or Making Suggestions ===

At other times, the translator may have a question or they may want to make a suggestion about the program or content. The people that have worked on the program are very interested in what you, the user, think. **Please feel free to share any questions or comments.**

To ask a question or make a comment:
  - Click on the 3-dot menu found at the bottom left of the window. 
  - Choose **Feedback** from the list. 
  - Use the keyboard to type in an explanation of the problem that you have been experiencing.
  - Click on **Confirm** at the bottom right of the Feedback window. 


**Note:** The feedback will be sent when there is an Internet connection.
