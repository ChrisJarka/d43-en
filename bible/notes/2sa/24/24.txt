\v 24 And the king said to Araunah, Nay; but I will verily buy it of you at a price. Neither will I offer burnt offerings
to Jehovah my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
\v 25 And David built there an altar to Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings and peace-offerings. So Jehovah was entreated
for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
