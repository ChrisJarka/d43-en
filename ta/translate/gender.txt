====== Gender Notations ======

The English language makes a distinction in pronouns between male, female and neutral nouns.

"Whomever" is neither masculine nor feminine. The same is true for 'it'; however, it is not a word English ever uses for people.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

The author followed the natural grammatical pattern of his own language, only making such distinctions when he wants to make a deliberate contrast. The translator should also follow the natural grammatical pattern of the Target Language.
