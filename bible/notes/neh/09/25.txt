\v 25 Our ancestors captured cities that had walls around them, and they took possession of fertile land. They took possession of houses that were full of good things, where there were wells that were already dug. They took possession of many vineyards and groves of olive trees and fruit trees. They ate all that they wanted to and became fat. They were delighted in all these good things that you gave to them.

vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted
themselves in your great goodness.
