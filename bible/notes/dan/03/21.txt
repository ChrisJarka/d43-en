\v 21 Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their
other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
\v 22 Therefore because the kingâ€™s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men
that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.
\v 23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
