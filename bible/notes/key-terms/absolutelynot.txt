====== absolutely not, may it never be, God forbid ======

When used by Paul, this is the strongest way of saying that what he is speaking about can never happen or must never happen. If he says Jesus can absolutely not cause anyone to sin, he means it is impossible for Jesus to cause anyone to sin. If Paul says may it never be that I should sin, he means it is his fervent desire and wish that he not sin.
