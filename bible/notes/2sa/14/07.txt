====== 2 Samuel 14:7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Now, all my family oppose me. They are insisting that I allow them to kill my son who is still alive \f + \ft metonymy \f*, in order that they may get revenge for his killing his brother. But if they do that, I will not have any son to inherit \add my possessions\add*. That would be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* extinguishing the last coals of a fire, and my husband would not have a son to preserve our family's name. \f + \ft doublet \f*"

\v 7 And, behold, the whole family is risen against your handmaid, and they say, Deliver him that struck his brother, that we may
kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left,
and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.
