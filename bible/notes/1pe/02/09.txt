\v 9 But you are people whom God has chosen to belong to him. You are a group that worship God like priests, and you rule with God like kings. You are a people group that belongs to God, so that you might proclaim the wonderful things he has done. He has called you from your former ways, when you were ignorant of his truth, and he has made you understand the marvelous true things about him.
\v 10 What the Scriptures say is true about you:
\q "Formerly, you were no people group at all,
\q But now you are God's people group.
\q At one time God had not acted mercifully toward you,
\q But now he has acted mercifully toward you."

\v 9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's possession, so that you would announce the wonderful actions of the one who called you out from darkness into his marvelous light.
\q
\v 10 You were once not a people, 
\q but you are now the people of God.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verse 10 Paul quotes a verse from the prophet Hosea. Some modern versions do not format this as a quote, which is also acceptable. 

  * **you are a chosen race** - The word "you" refers to believers in Christ. 
  * **called you out** - "called you to come out" or "called you to turn away from" 
  * **from darkness into his marvelous light** - Here "darkness" means the people were sinful and did not know God. And, "light" means God caused them to know him and to start doing what pleases him. AT: "from a life of sin and ignorance of God to a life of knowing and pleasing him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
