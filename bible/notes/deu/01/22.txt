\v 22 But all of your ancestors came to me and said, 'Before we go, we should \add first\add* send some men there to explore the land, in order that they can return and tell us which will be the best road to go there and what kind of towns are there.'
\p
\v 23 I thought that it would be good to do that, so I chose twelve men, one man from each tribe.
\v 24 They went up into the hilly area as far as Eshcol Valley, and they explored all that area.

\v 22 And you came near to me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.
\v 23 And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:
\v 24 and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
