\v 13 We are not discouraged. We are like \add the person who\add* wrote \add in the Scriptures\add*, "\add God\add*, I trusted \add in you\add* and so I continue speaking \add your message\add*." We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* also trust \add in God\add*, so we continue speaking \add his message\add*.
\v 14 \add We do this\add* because we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* know that \add although people might kill us, God\add*, who caused the Lord Jesus to live again after he died, will also cause us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* to live again \add after we die. God will do this because we belong to\add* Jesus. \add And then God\add* will bring us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, together with you, to be with him.
\v 15 \add So I say that\add* all these things \add that we\f + \ft exclusive \f* suffer\add* are in order to help you. \add We have suffered all this\add* in order that more and more people, \add as a result of hearing that God will\add* kindly\f + \ft Or: freely \f* \add forgive their sins\add*, will thank \add him and praise him. Then\add* they will greatly honor him \add and worship him\add*.

\v 13 We have the same spirit of faith as is written in Scripture, "I trusted in him, this is why I speak." We are like the person who wrote that Scripture because we also trust in God and we also speak about what he has done for us.
\v 14 We know that the one who raised up the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us up from the dead with Jesus, and he will bring us with you, and there to be where God is.
\v 15 Everything that we go through, all we do for you, so that as God generous gift to us who did not deserve it, can spread to more and more people, thanksgiving offered to God will grow and more people will honor God.

<usfm>
\v 13 But we have the same spirit of faith according to that which was written, "I believed, and so I spoke." We also believe, and so we also speak,
\v 14 knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus, and will bring us with you into his presence.
\v 15 Everything is for your sake so that, as grace is spread to many people, thanksgiving may increase to the glory of God.
