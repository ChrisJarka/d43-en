====== magic, magician ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "magic" refers to the practice of using supernatural power that does not come from God. A magician is someone who practices magic.

  * In the Bible, "magic" often refers to pagan practices of divination.
  * Pagan magicians or diviners would use different methods of trying to find out information, such as examining animal entrails or throwing animal bones on the ground, looking for patterns.
  * Magicians or diviners interpret these patterns as signs or guidance from a false god that they worship.
  * God forbids all such practices for his people since these lead them to believe in superstitions rather than in his word.
