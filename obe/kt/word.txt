====== word ======

===== Definition: =====

A "word" refers to something that someone has said.

  * An example of this would be when the angel told Zechariah "You did not believe my words" which means "You did not believe what I said."
  * This term almost always refers to an entire message, not just one word.
  * Often in the Bible, "the word" refers to everything God has said or commanded, as in "the word of God" or "word of truth"
  * Sometimes "word" refers to speech in general such as "powerful in word and deed" which means "powerful in speech and behavior."
  * A very special use of this term is when Jesus is called "the Word."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Different ways of translating "word" or "words" include, "teaching," "message," "news", "a saying" or "what was said."
  * When it refers to Jesus, this term could be translated as "the Message" or "the Saying." If there is a term in the target language for one word, this would be the best term to use here.
