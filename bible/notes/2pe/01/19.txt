\v 19 We are sure  about this prophetic word. You do well to attend to it. The word is like a lamp that shines in a dark place until the morning comes and the sun rises--in your hearts:
\v 20 Know this first, that all written prophecy does not come from the reasoning of the prophet.

\v 21 No prophecy ever came by the will of man, but it came by the Holy Spirit to men who spoke from God.
