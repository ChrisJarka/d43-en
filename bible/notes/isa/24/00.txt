====== Isaiah 24 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

While it appears that this chapter is a continuation of the prophecy from the previous chapter, it looks at the Assyrian conquest as a whole as Yahweh's punishment on the world. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Covenant ==
The mention of an "everlasting covenant" in this chapter is probably not to a specific covenant with Abraham or Moses. Instead, it is an expectation that mankind would obey Yahweh. Some consider this to be a covenant Yahweh made with Adam. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:eternity]] and [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Reign of Yahweh ==
It appears that some aspects of this prophecy are still to be fulfilled in the last day before Yahweh reigns on earth in Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])
