===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to talk to the people about John the Baptist)
    * **This is he of whom it is written** - That is, "He is the one the prophets wrote about" or "The one you went out to see is the one the prophets wrote about long ago"
    * **before your face** -
    * **among them that are born of women**  - That is, "among those to whom a woman has given birth." It is a figure of speech referring to all people. It could also be translated as "among all the people who have ever lived" or "of all people who have ever lived."
    * **the least important person**  - A more literal way of translating this is "the smallest person." It might also be translated as "the least important person in the kingdom of God, which came after John the Baptist."
    * **in the kingdom of God** - This could also be translated as, "who has come into the kingdom of God" or "who has submitted to God's rule."
    * **greater** - That is, "more important."
