<usfm>
\v 21 After I left Jerusalem, I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
\v 22 At that time believers in the Christian congregations who were in the province of Judea still had never seen me.
\v 23 They only heard others keep saying, "Paul, the one who in the past was doing violent things to us, is now proclaiming the same Good News that we believe and he had been trying to stop!"
\v 24 So they kept praising God because of what had happened to me.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
\v 22 I was still not known by sight to the churches of Judea that were in Christ,
\v 23 but they were only hearing, "He who once was persecuting us now proclaims the faith that he had been destroying,"
\v 24 and they were praising God because of me.
