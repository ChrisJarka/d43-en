\q
\v 4 I said, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me:
\q Heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
\q
\v 5 Mine enemies speak evil against me, saying,
\q When will he die, and his name perish?
\q
\v 6 And if he come to see me, he speaks falsehood;
\q His heart gathers iniquity to itself:
\q When he goes abroad, he tells it.
