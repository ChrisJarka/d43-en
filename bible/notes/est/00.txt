**What is the Book of Esther about?**\\

The Book of Esther is the account of a terrible plot to kill all the Jews living in the Persian Empire. These were the descendants of the Jews whom the Babylonians had taken into exile. 

This book tells how a young Jewish woman named Esther became the queen of Persia, the most important wife of the king of Persia. The book implies that God used Esther to save her people from destruction.

The Book of Esther ends by explaining that the Jewish festival of Purim began as a celebration of God's rescue of the Jews. The name "Purim" comes from "pur," the lots or dice that the Jews' main enemy threw in order to decide on what day to begin killing them.

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\

The traditional title of this book is, "The Book of Esther." However, it is possible to make the title's more clear in other languages. We recommend, "The Book about Esther" or "The History about Esther."



===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
**What was the Persian Empire?**\\

The Persian Empire, or more properly, the First Persian Empire, consisted of many kingdoms and regions that King Cyrus the Great conquered and ruled over. When he conquered Babylonia in 539 B.C., he came into control of the Jews who were there. 

**Why were there Jews in Babylonia when the Persians conquered it?**\\

These Jews were the descendants of the people of Judah who had survived the attacks of the Babylonian army about 586 B.C. under King Nebuchadnezzar II.

**What was meant by "the Laws of the Medes and Persians"?**\\

This idea, found in Esther 1:19 and Daniel 6:12, referred to laws and decrees which, once issued, could not be taken back. The Medes were an ethnic group who had formed their own nation, but who were taken over by the Persians and absorbed into them.
