This begins an account of Jesus calming a storm.

  * **entered a boat** - "Jesus got onto a boat"
  * **his disciples followed him** - Try to use the same words for "disciple" and "follow" that you used in ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:21|8:21]]) and ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:21|8:22]]).
  * **Behold** - This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of doing this.
  * **there arose a great storm on the sea** - "a great storm arose on the sea."
  * **so that the boat was covered with the waves** - "so that the waves covered the boat." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **woke him up, saying, "Save us** - Possible meanings are 1) As they were waking Jesus up they were saying "Save us." or 2) They first woke Jesus and after Jesus was awake they said, "Save us."
  * **we are about to die** - "we are going to die"
