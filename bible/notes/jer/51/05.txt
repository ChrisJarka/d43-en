===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Israel and Judah are not forsaken by their God, by Yahweh of hosts** - The words "Israel" and "Judah" are metonyms for the people of Israel and Judah. This can be translated in active form. AT: "Yahweh of hosts, the God of the people of Israel and Judah, has not forsaken them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **their land is filled with offenses committed against the Holy One of Israel** - The land in which they live is spoken of as if it were a container and their offenses as if they were solid objects that could fill the container. The abstract noun "offenses" can be translated as a verb. AT: "they have offended the Holy One of Israel everywhere throughout the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **in her iniquity** - Babylon is spoken of as if it were a woman. The word "iniquity" is a metonym for God punishing the people for their iniquity. AT: "when Yahweh punishes Babylon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will repay all of it to her** - Babylon is spoken of as if it were a woman, and the iniquity of the people is spoken of as if Yahweh needed to pay back a debt. The word "her," meaning Babylon, is a metonym for the people of Babylon. AT: "will punish the Babylonians as much as they deserve" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
