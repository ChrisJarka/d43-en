====== Isaiah 28:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Terrible things will happen to \add Samaria city, the capital of Israel\add*!
\q2 It is on a hill above a fertile valley;
\q1 the people who live there, who get drunk by drinking too much wine, are very proud;
\q2 it is a beautiful and glorious city,
\q2 but some day that beauty will disappear like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a flower that wilts and dries up.
\q1
\v 2 Listen to this: Yahweh will cause a great army to attack it.
\q2 Their soldiers will be like \f + \ft simile \f* a huge hailstorm or a very strong wind;
\q1 they will be everywhere, like the water of a huge flood,
\q2 and they will smash to the ground \add the buildings in Samaria\add*.

\q1
\v 1 Woe to the proud garland of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty,
\q1 that is on the head of the lush valley of those who are overcome with wine!
\q1
\v 2 Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one; as a hailstorm,
\q1 a destroying storm, as a cloudburst of might and overwhelming,
\q1 he will strike the earth with his hand.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Woe to the proud garland ... on the head of the lush valley of those who are overcome with wine** - A "garland" is a crown made of flowers. Here it is a metonym that represents proud people who wear garlands to parties and get drunk. It is also a metaphor that speaks of the city of Samaria, which is located at the top of a fertile valley, as if it were a garland on the head of the valley. Isaiah speaks of terrible things happening to the proud people of Samaria as if they were a garland and its flowers will no longer be beautiful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Behold** - "Listen" or "Pay attention"
  * **who are overcome with wine** - "who are drunk with wine"
  * **the Lord has a mighty and strong one; as a hailstorm ... overwhelming** - A "hailstorm" is when hard pieces of ice fall from the sky. Here it is a simile that refers to the enemy army that Yahweh will send to destroy the people of Samaria. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **a mighty and strong one** - Here "one" refers to a mighty king who has a powerful army.
  * **he will strike the earth with his hand** - The word "he" refers to the "mighty and strong one" who is the king of the enemy army. Here "hand" represents his powerful army. AT: "his powerful army will throw them down to the ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
