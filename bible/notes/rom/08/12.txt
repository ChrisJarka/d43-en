<usfm> \v 12 Therefore, my fellow believers, we must live as the Spirit directs us. What we do not have to do is live as our old evil heart wants us to. \v 13 If you do what your old evil heart wants, you will surely not live forever with God. But if you allow the Spirit to stop you doing those things, then you will live forever.
