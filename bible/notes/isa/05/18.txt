    * **Woe to those who pull along iniquity with cords of emptiness and sin with a cart rope** - "Terrible things will happen to people who continue in sin"  This likens people who sin to weaving a string which turns into a cart rope which enslaves them.  (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
    * **those who say** - "the sinful people will say" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:active]])
    * **God...him** - "Yahweh"
    * **so we can see it happen** - "We" refers to those people who are sinning and are mocking God by telling him to prove to them that he will punish them for their sin.
