\q
\v 15 When I make the land of Egypt--a land that was full--a wasteland and a desolation;
\q When I strike all of her inhabitants, then they will know that I am Yahweh!
\q
\v16 There will be a lament! For the daughters of the nations will lament her, they will lament concerning Egypt,
\q And concerning all her entourage, they will lament for them!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’”
