\c 50

\v 1 Thus says Jehovah, Where is the bill of your motherâ€™s divorcement, wherewith I have put her away? or which of my
creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities were you sold, and for your transgressions was your mother
put away.
\v 2 Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it
cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish
stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.
\v 3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
\p
\v 4 The Lord Jehovah has given me the tongue of them that are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him that is
weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as they that are taught.
\v 5 The Lord Jehovah has opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward.
\v 6 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
\v 7 For the Lord Jehovah will help me; therefore have I not been confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I
know that I shall not be put to shame.
\v 8 He is near that justifies me; who will contend with me? let us stand up together: who is mine adversary? let him come
near to me.
\v 9 Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? behold, they all shall wax old as a garment; the
moth shall eat them up.
\p
\v 10 Who is among you that fears Jehovah, that obeys the voice of his servant? he that walks in darkness, and has no
light, let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and rely upon his God.
\v 11 Behold, all you that kindle a fire, that gird yourselves about with firebrands; walk you in the flame of your fire, and
among the brands that you have kindled. This shall you have of my hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.
