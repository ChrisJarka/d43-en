===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I saw **  â€“ Isaiah begins to describe a vision that God gave to him. This could be translated as "I saw in a vision" or "YHWH gave me, Isaiah, a vision of."
  * **the Lord sitting **  - When Isaiah saw the Lord, the Lord was sitting. Isaiah was not the one sitting.
  * **on a high and elevated throne **- The words "high" and "elevated" most likely form a hendiadys meaning "very high" or "extremely high." The hight of the throne emphasizes the supreme authority and holiness of the Lord. (See: Hendiadys)
  * **the hem of his robe **- This refers to the outer edge of the garment that the Lord was wearing. It could be translated as "the border of his garment" or "the edge of his garment."
  * **filled the temple **- The word used for temple here is often used to refer to the palace of kings. Since, the Lord is a king his temple is considered a palace. This continues Isaiah's emphasis on the Lordship of YHWH found in this passage.
  * **above him **- "above the Lord"
  * **Seraphim**  - These creatures are only mentioned in Isaiah 6, verses 2 and 6. The word in Hebrew suggest that the creatures might have a fiery appearance or resemble snakes. Because we do not know exactly what the "seraphim" are, it would be best to translate the word with a generic term such as "creatures" or "living things" or "beings".
  * **each one had six wings **- "each one of the seraphim had six wings" (See: Ellipsis)
  * **with two each covered **- "with two wings each seraph covered" <font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>(See: Ellipsis)</font>
