\v 21 And you also, at one time, were alienated and were enemies in your mind and by your evil works.
\v 22 Yet now he has reconciled you in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable before him
\v 23 if you continue grounded and settled in the faith and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you heard and that was proclaimed in all the creation under heaven, the gospel that I, Paul, came to serve.
