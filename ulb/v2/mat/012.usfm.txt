\v 1 At that season Jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck
ears and to eat.
\v 2 But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, Behold, your disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the
sabbath.
\v 3 But he said to them, Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him;
\v 4 how he entered into the house of God, and ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that
were with him, but only for the priests?
\v 5 Or have you not read in the law, that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless?
\v 6 But I say to you, that one greater than the temple is here.
\v 7 But if you had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.
\v 8 For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.
\p
\v 9 And he departed thence, and went into their synagogue:
\v 10 and behold, a man having a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they
might accuse him.
\v 11 And he said to them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the
sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?
\v 12 How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.
\v 13 Then says he to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.
\v 14 But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.
\p
\v 15 And Jesus perceiving it withdrew from thence: and many followed him; and he healed them all,
\v 16 and charged them that they should not make him known:
\v 17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\q
\v 18 Behold, my servant whom I have chosen;
\q My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased:
\q I will put my Spirit upon him,
\q And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles.
\q
\v 19 He shall not strive, nor cry aloud;
\q Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets.
\q
\v 20 A bruised reed shall he not break,
\q And smoking flax shall he not quench,
\q Till he send forth judgment to victory.
\q
\v 21 And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.
\p
\v 22 Then was brought to him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spoke
and saw.
\v 23 And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David?
\v 24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man does not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.
\v 25 And knowing their thoughts he said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every
city or house divided against itself shall not stand:
\v 26 and if Satan throws out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
\v 27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
\v 28 But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.
\v 29 Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong
man? and then he will spoil his house.
\v 30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathers not with me scattereth.
\v 31 Therefore I say to you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall
not be forgiven.
\v 32 And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever shall speak against the
Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.
\v 33 Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by
its fruit.
\v 34 You offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
speaketh.
\v 35 The good man out of his good treasure brings forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings
forth evil things.
\v 36 And I say to you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
\v 37 For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.
\p
\v 38 Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee.
\v 39 But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be
given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet:
\v 40 for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three
nights in the heart of the earth.
\v 41 The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the
preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
\v 42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the
ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
\v 43 But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and finds it
not.
\v 44 Then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, he finds it empty, swept, and
garnished.
\v 45 Then goes he, and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and
the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so shall it be also to this evil generation.
\p
\v 46 While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.
\v 47 And one said to him, Behold, your mother and your brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.
\v 48 But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
\v 49 And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren!
\v 50 For whoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
