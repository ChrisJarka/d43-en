====== Personification [pərˌsänəfiˈkāSHən] ======


Personification is a kind of simile or metaphor, in which an idea or something that is not alive is referred to as if it were a person and could do the things people do or have the attributes people have.


===== Purposes of Personification =====


===== Examples from English =====


**That delicious looking dessert is calling out to me "Eat me. Eat me."** This personification helps to show how tempted the speaker feels to eat the cake and also helps to shift the responsibility for the speakers choice to eat it from the speaker to the cake.


**The raging fire devoured everything in it's way.** \\ 
This description of the fire helps show how terrifying and destructive it was by comparing it to a wild animal that devours other animals.


**The flowers danced in the gentle breeze.** This personification shows how pleasant and light-hearted the situation was.
===== Examples from the Bible =====


**Wisdom is justified by all her children.** Luke 7:35 (WEB)\\ 
Here Jesus spoke of wisdom as if it were a woman that has children. Wisdom's "children" are people who believe and follow wisdom. As a result of following God's wisdom they live wisely, and their wise behavior proves that God's wisdom is right.


**Therefore also __the wisdom of God said__, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,** Luke 11:49 (WEB)\\ 
Here God's wisdom is personified as if it could speak.


**But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. __Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed__. Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.** Luke 23:23b, 24 (WEB)\\ 
In this personification, the people's voices and Pilate's voice are portrayed as if they are in a battle, and the people's shouting voices win the battle. Pilate would do what they wanted.


No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. __You can’t serve both God and riches__. Matthew 6:24. Here riches is personified as a master whom people might serve.
===== Translation Suggestions =====


    * If the personification would be understood correctly, use it.
    * Using the words "like" or "as" can help clarify that this is a figure of speech, as in 1 Thessalonians 5:4, "that the day should overtake you __like__  a thief"
    * If it wouldn't be understood correctly, find a way to translate it without the personification. For example, "The wisdom of God said" could be translating as "God in his wisdom said."
