===== translationNotes that Identify Figures of Speech =====


==== Description =====

Figures of speech are ways of saying things that use words in non-literal ways. That is, the meaning of a figure of speech is not the same as the more direct meaning of its words. There are many different types of Figures of Speech. 


In the translationNotes there will be an explanation on how to translate the Figure of Speech that is in the passage. Sometimes an Alternate Translation (AT:) is provided. There will also be a link to the translationAcademy page for additional information and translation strategies to help the translator accurately translate for the meaning of the passage. 

In order to translate the meaning, you need to be able to recognize figures of speech and know what the figure of speech means in the source language. Then you can choose either a figure of speech or a direct way to communicate that same meaning in the target language. 

==== Translation Notes Examples ====

> Many will come in my __name__ and say, 'I am he,' and they will lead many astray. (Mark 13:6 ULB)

  * **Many will come in my name** - The word "name" represents the authority of Jesus. AT: "Many will come, claiming my __authority and permission__ and say," (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 

In this example the Figure of Speech is explained and then followed by an alternate translation (AT). After the AT is the link to the tA page about Metonymy. Click on the link to learn the strategies to accurately translate Metonymy.

> "You offspring of poisonous snakes, who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming? (Luke 3:7 ULB)

  * **You offspring of poisonous snakes** - This is a word picture. Poisonous snakes are dangerous and represent evil. AT: "You evil poisonous snakes!" or "You are evil like poisonous snakes." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
