====== Grammar Topics ======

I'm trying to make this a simple directory to the big grammar/syntax topics.

**[[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences]]**\\
When we speak, we organize our thoughts in sentences. A sentence usually has a complete thought about an event or a situation or state of being. \\ 
 
**[[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]**
Some languages have both active and passive sentences.
  * ACTIVE: My father built the house in 2010. 
  * PASSIVE: The house was built in 2010. 

**[[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech]]** \\ 
All words in a language belong to a category called a  part of speech. \\ 


**Quotations** \\ 
A quotation is a report of what someone else has said.  \\ 
**[[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_quotations]]** tells about the two parts of a quote. \\ 
**[[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]]** tells about direct and indirect quotes
  * He said, “I will come.” 
  * He said that he would come.
