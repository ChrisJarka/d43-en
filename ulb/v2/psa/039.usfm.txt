\c 39
\d For the Chief Musician, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I said, I will take heed to my ways,
\q That I sin not with my tongue:
\q I will keep my mouth with a bridle,
\q While the wicked is before me.
\q
\v 2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good;
\q And my sorrow was stirred.
\q
\v 3 My heart was hot within me;
\q While I was musing the fire burned;
\q Then spoke I with my tongue:
\q
\v 4 Jehovah, make me to know mine end,
\q And the measure of my days, what it is;
\q Let me know how frail I am.
\q
\v 5 Behold, you have made my days as handbreadths;
\q And my life-time is as nothing before thee:
\q Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 Surely every man walks in a vain show;
\q Surely they are disquieted in vain:
\q He heapeth up riches, and knows not who shall gather them.
\q
\v 7 And now, Lord, what wait I for?
\q My hope is in thee.
\q
\v 8 Deliver me from all my transgressions:
\q Make me not the reproach of the foolish.
\q
\v 9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth;
\q Because you did it.
\q
\v 10 Remove your stroke away from me:
\q I am consumed by the blow of your hand.
\q
\v 11 When you with rebukes do correct man for iniquity,
\q You make his beauty to consume away like a moth:
\q Surely every man is vanity. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 12 Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear to my cry;
\q Hold not your peace at my tears:
\q For I am a stranger with thee,
\q A sojourner, as all my fathers were.
\q
\v 13 Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,
\q Before I go hence, and be no more.
