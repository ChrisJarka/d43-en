\q
\v 19 Then you spoke in vision to your saints,
\q And saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty;
\q I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
\q
\v 20 I have found David my servant;
\q With my holy oil have I anointed him:
\q
\v 21 With whom my hand shall be established;
\q Mine arm also shall strengthen him.
\q
\v 22 The enemy shall not exact from him,
\q Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
\q
\v 23 And I will beat down his adversaries before him,
\q And strike them that hate him.
