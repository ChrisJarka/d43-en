\v 23 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass,
to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
\v 24 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and killed him: and his body was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it;
the lion also stood by the body.
\v 25 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told
it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
