===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 God did not spare the angels who sinned. He handed them down to Tartarus, to be kept in chains in darkness until the judgment.
\v 5 God did not spare the ancient world. He brought a flood upon the world of ungodly men, but he did  preserve Noah--a herald of righteousness--with seven others.
\v 6 He reduced the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes. He condemned them to destruction as an example of what is to come to  ungodly men.
