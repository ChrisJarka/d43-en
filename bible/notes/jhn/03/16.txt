\v 17 When God sent his Son into the world, his purpose was not to punish the \add people in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world for their sins. Instead, he sent him in order that they might be saved by him \f + \ft Or:he might save them \f* \add from being\add* \add guilty\f + \ft Or: punished\add* \f* \add for their sins\add*.
\v 18 Everyone who trusts in his Son, \add God says that they\add* will not be punished \f + \ft Or:that he will not punish them \f*. But God has already \add said that\add* everyone who does not trust in his Son will be punished \f + \ft Or:that he will punish everyone who does not trust in his Son \f*, because they have not trusted in what his only Son \add has done for them\add*.

\v 16 God loved the world so much, that he gave his only Son, that everyone who trusts in him, would not die, but would have eternal life.
\v 17 God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world but to save it.
\v 18 Everyone who trusts in the Son, God will never condemn, but everyone who does not trust in him, God has condemned already, because they did not put their trust in the name of the only Son of God.

\v 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only unique Son, that whoever believes on him should not perish but
have eternal life.
\v 17 For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world should be saved through him.
\v 18 He that believes on him is not condemned.  He that does not believe has been already condemned, because he has not believed on
the name of the unique Son of God.
