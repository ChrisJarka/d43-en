===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **After leaving there** - "After Jesus left the Pharisee's house"
  * ** the scribes and the Pharisees opposed him and argued with him** -  "the scribes and the Pharisees began to oppose him and argue with him"  They began to do this habitually.
  * **trying to trap him in his own words** - This is a metaphor. They wanted him to say something wrong so that they could accuse him. It can be translated without the metaphor as in the UDB.
