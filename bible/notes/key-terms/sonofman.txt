====== Son of Man ======

===== Definition: =====

The title, "Son of Man" is best known for how Jesus used it to refer to himself. There are different interpretations regarding its meaning.

  * In the Old Testament, the phrase, "son of man" is often used to mean "man" or "human being."
  * God also used "son of man" many times to address the prophet Ezekiel as when he said, "…you, son of man, must prophesy…."
  * Jesus often used this term to refer to himself instead of saying "I" or "me." Some have said that during that time period, it was a modest way of referring to oneself.
  * The prophet Daniel saw a vision of a "son of man" coming with the clouds. Many interpret this to be a prophecy about the Messiah.
  * Many years later, John also saw a vision of a son of man sitting on the clouds and Jesus referred to the Son of Man coming back on the clouds. These show that the Son of Man is also divine.
  * The title "Son of Man" emphasizes Jesus' humanity. While Jesus was fully God, he was also fully human.
  * One way to translate this in the New Testament would be to say "I, the Son of Man" to make it clear that Jesus is talking about himself.
  * When Jesus uses it, this can also be translated as, "I, the one who became a human being" or "the man from heaven."
  * Check to make sure the translation of this term does not give the wrong meaning.
