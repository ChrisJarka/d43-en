\v 37 "O people of Jerusalem, you who killed the prophets who lived long ago, and you who killed others whom God sent to you with stones. Many, many times I wanted to gather you together to protect you, like a hen gathers her young chicks under her wings. But you did not want me to do that.
\v 38 So listen to this: Your city will become an uninhabited place.
\v 39 Keep this in mind: You will see me again only when I return, when you say about me, 'God is truly pleased with this man who comes with God's authority.'"

\v 37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often did I long to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but you did not agree!
\v 38 See, your house is left to you abandoned.
\v 39 For I say to you, You will not see me from now on, until you say, 'Blessed
is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'
