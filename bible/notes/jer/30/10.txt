<usfm>
\v 10 Therefore fear you not, O Jacob my servant, says Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save you from
afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall
make him afraid.
\v 11 For I am with thee, says Jehovah, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered
you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct you in measure, and will in no wise leave you unpunished.
