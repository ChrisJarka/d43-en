<usfm>
\v 3-4 But he was \add suddenly\add* taken \f + \ft Or:\add Christ suddenly\add* took him \f* up to \add a place called\add* Paradise, \add that wonderful place where God lives. I repeat that\add* I do not know whether his body \add went there\add* or only his spirit. Only God knows \add that. While he was there, God\add* told him some things that he does not allow \add human beings\add* to tell \add others about\add*.
\v 5 I will proudly talk about that man. However, I will not be boasting \add as\add* I say that I \add am the one who saw and heard those wonderful things\add*. I will talk only about the things that \add cause others to think of\add* me as a weak \add human being like everyone else\add*.

\v 3  And I know this man—but if this were a real, physical man or if this were an amazing vision of a man, I do not know, but God knows the truth—
\v 4 and he was taken up into a place in heaven called paradise and there he heard about things so different, so wonderful, and so beautiful that he could not express what he had heard or explain them in human speech.
\v 5 I will give praise to a man like this, and I do not praise myself in foolishness, but I will speak only the truth about him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 And I know such a man—whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—
\v 4 who was caught up into paradise and he heard things no one can put into words.
\v 5 On behalf of such a person I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.
