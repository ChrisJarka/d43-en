===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Therefore, all the evil things you want to do in this world--think of them as enemies that must die. You must execute them: Do not try to do sexually immoral or impure acts. Do not think in lustful or evil ways. And do not be greedy, because that is the same as worshiping idols. 

Therefore, get rid of all sinful desires related to this world, as if they are enemies that must be killed. Do not seek to do sexually immoral or impure acts. Do not carry out lustful or evil thoughts. And do not act with greed. These things are like worshipping idols instead of the true God, because God is set apart from such sinfulness.
\v 6 It is because people do things like these that God is angry with them, for they do not obey him.

Because of such sin the anger of God comes upon those who disobey him.
\v 7 You yourselves also formerly lived like that when you were participating with those who behaved like that.
\v 8 But now you must doing these things. Do not be angry at each other; do not try to make trouble for each other. Do not insult each other or talk in shameful, disgusting ways.


So now get rid of all these sinful ways, as if you were putting them to death. Do not angrily rage at others or scheme to cause trouble. Do not let evil or filthy or blasphemous words be spoken from out of your mouths, and
