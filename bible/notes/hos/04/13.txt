\q
\v 13 They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,
\q and burn incense on the hills,
\q under oaks, poplars and terebinths,
\q because its shade is good.
\q Therefore your daughters commit prostitution,
\q and your brides commit adultery.
\q
\v 14 I will not punish your daughters when they commit prostitution,
\q nor your brides when they commit adultery.
\q For the men consort with prostitutes,
\q and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes.
\q The people who do not understand will come to ruin.
