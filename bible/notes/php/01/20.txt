===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **It is my confident expectation and hope that I will not be ashamed.**  - Paul is using a doublet to emphasize how sure he is that he is living in a way that glorifies Christ. This can be translated as "I definitely expect and trust that I will not have regrets." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
    * **my, I**  - These pronouns refer to Paul.  (See: [[en:ta:translate:singularpronoun]])
    * **But with all courage, as always and especially right now,**  - "But I will have enough courage right now, as I have always had,"
    * **I will bring glory to Christ in my body,**  - Paul uses the physical "body" as a metonym for his life or the way he lives. "so that I will honor Christ by my life," (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]]) 
   * ** whether by life or by death.**  - "if I go on living or if I die."
   * **For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.**  - "Because if I go on living, I will live for Christ, and if I die, that is even better."
