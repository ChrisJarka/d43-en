\v 22 And if men fight together and hurt a pregnant woman so that she miscarries, but there is no other injury to her, then he will surely be fined, according as the womanâ€™s husband's demands are of him, and he shall pay as the judges determine.
\v 23 But if there is serious injuy, then you will give a life for a life,
\v 24 an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot,
\v 25 burning for burning, a wound for a wound, or a bruise for a bruise.
