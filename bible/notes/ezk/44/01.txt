\p
\v 1 Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looks toward the east; and it was shut.
\v 2 And Jehovah said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for
Jehovah, the God of Israel, has entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.
\v 3 As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by the way of the porch of
the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
