\v 14 â€œNow fear Yahweh, and serve him with all integrity and faithfulness; and put away the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh.
\v 15 If it evil in your eyes for you to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves, this day, whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live. But as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh.
