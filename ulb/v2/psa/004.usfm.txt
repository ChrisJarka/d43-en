\c 4
\d For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness;
\q You have set me at large when I was in distress:
\q Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
\q
\v 2 O you sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?
\q How long will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood?
\qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 3 But know that Jehovah has set apart for himself him that is godly:
\q Jehovah will hear when I call to him.
\q
\v 4 Stand in awe, and sin not:
\q Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,
\q And put your trust in Jehovah.
\q
\v 6 Many there are that say, Who will show us any good?
\q Jehovah, lift you up the light of your countenance upon us.
\q
\v 7 You have put gladness in my heart,
\q More than they have when their grain and their new wine are increased.
\q
\v 8 In peace will I both lay me down and sleep;
\q For thou, Jehovah, alone make me dwell in safety.
