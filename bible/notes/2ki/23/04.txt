\v 4 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to
bring forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of
heaven, and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Beth-el.
\v 5 And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the
cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon,
and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
