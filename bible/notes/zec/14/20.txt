\v 20 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLY UNTO JEHOVAH; and the pots in Jehovahâ€™s house shall be like
the bowls before the altar.
\v 21 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy to Jehovah of hosts; and all they that sacrifice shall come and
take of them, and boil therein: and in that day there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts.
