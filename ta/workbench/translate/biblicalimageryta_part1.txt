===== Description =====

In all languages, most metaphors fall into broad patterns of associations between ideas. The patterns of associations found in the Bible are often unique to the Hebrew and Greek languages. It is useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems on how to translate them. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere.

For example, one pattern of associations in the Bible is that plants represent moral qualities. In Hosea 10:12 the words "sow," "reap," and "fruit" give the image of planting something. Righteousness and covenant faithfulness are moral qualities. Just as sowing a certain kind of seed results in reaping that kind of plant, doing what is righteous results in benefiting from covenant faithfulness.

> Sow righteousness for yourselves, and reap the fruit of covenant faithfulness.  (Hosea 10:12 ULB)

This patterns is also seen Job 4:8. The words "plow," "sow" and "reap" give the image of planting something. Doing what is evil and causing trouble are spoken of as plowing and sowing them. Just as plowing and sowing a certain kind of seed results in reaping that kind of plant, doing what is evil and causing trouble results in having troubles.

>Based on what I have observed, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble, reap the same. (Job 4:8 ULB)

When translators become familiar with these patterns, they will see that many **similes** in the Bible are built on these same associations of ideas. Luke 17:6 has a simile in which the image of a mustard seed is associated with the moral quality of faith.

>If you had faith as a mustard seed, you would say to this sycamore tree, 'Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you. (Luke 17:6 ULB)

==== Reasons this is a translation Issue ==== 

These patterns of associating one idea with another present three challenges to anyone who wants to identify them:

(1) When looking at particular metaphors in the Bible, it is not always obvious what two ideas are associated with each other. For example, it may not be immediately obvious that the expression //It is God who puts strength on me like a belt// Ps. 18:32 (ULB) is based on the association of clothing with moral quality. In this case, the image of a belt represents strength. (See: "Clothing represents a moral quality" in [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_manmade]])

(2) When looking at a particular expression, the translator needs to know whether or not it represents something else. This can only be done by considering the surrounding text. The surrounding text shows us for example, whether “lamp” refers concretely to a container with oil and a wick for giving light or whether "lamp" is an image  that represents life. (See: "FIRE or LAMP represents life" in [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_phenom]]). In Isaiah 42:1-3, the fact that that God's servant will bring justice shows that this passage is talking about people, not ordinary lamps. A dimly burning lamp is an image for a person who is in danger of dying.[[http://example.com|External Link]]

> Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen one, in him I take delight. I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring justice to the nations. He will not cry out nor shout, nor make his voice heard in the streets. A crushed reed he will not break, and __a dimly burning wick he will not quench__: he will faithfully execute justice. (Isaiah 42:3 ULB)
 

(3) Expressions that are based on these associations of ideas frequently combine together in complex ways. Moreover, they frequently combine with—and in some cases are based on—common metonymies and cultural models.  (See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part2]] and [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part3]].) For example, in 2 Samuel 14:7 "the burning coal" is an image for the life of the son, who represents what will cause people to remember his father. So there are two patterns of association here: the association of the image of the burning coal with the life of the son, and the association of the son with the memory of his father.

>They say, 'Hand over the man who struck his brother, so that we may put him to death, to pay for the life of his brother whom he killed.’ And so they would also destroy the heir. Thus they will put out __the burning coal__ that I have left, and they will leave for __my husband neither name nor descendant__ on the surface of the earth. 2 Sam. 14:7 (ULB)
