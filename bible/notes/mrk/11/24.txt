===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **stand and pray**  - Traditionally Jews would start morning, afternoon and evening services with "The Standing Prayer."  These were 18 general prayers that either praise God for something or ask God for something.  Jews still continue this tradition, though now have 19 prayers.  The Lord's Prayer, found in Matthew 6:9-13 and Luke 11:2-4 could be considered a shortened replacement for this prayer, though it is used by Christians while both sitting and standing, and in public services and in private.
    * **whatever you have against anyone**  - "whatever you're angry with someone else about"
