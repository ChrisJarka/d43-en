\v 17 Then Jesus said to him, "Simon, son of Jonah, God is pleased with you. What you just saidâ€”no human has revealed this to you. Instead, it was my Father who lives in heaven who has revealed this to you.
\v 18 I will also tell you this: You are Peter, which means 'rock.' You will be the support for the group of those who believe in me, like a large rock supports a great building. And even death will not be strong enough to destroy it."

\v 17 Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood have not revealed this to
you, but my Father who is in heaven.
\v 18 I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; the gates of Hades will 
not prevail against it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus responds to Peter's acknowledgment that Jesus is the Son of God.

  * **Simon Bar-Jonah** - Simon is Peter's name; Jesus adds "Bar-Jonah" which means "son of Jonah."
  * **for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you** - "no human being has revealed this to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **upon this rock** - Peter's name means "rock." This may be a reference to Peter's being the first public witness and support for those who believe in Jesus. It may also refer to Peter's confession that Christ is from God. This confession would be the foundation on which God would build his church. It probably does not mean that Peter is the rock on which God would build his church.
  * **gates of Hades** - This refers to the powers of death led by Satan himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
