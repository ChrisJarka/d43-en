===== How to Translate Names =====


There are many things to keep in mind when translating a name.


    * Proper names sometimes reveal information about the item.
    * Personal names may reveal something about the origin or history of the family.
    * Personal names may reveal something about a characteristic of the person.
    * Some people and some places have more than one name.
    * Usually names are used simply to identify a particular person or place. Even though the name may have a meaning, usually the meaning of the name is not in focus.


There are several ways to handle names when translating the Bible:


    * Pronounce the name as it is pronounced in the source language or another language, and using your language's spelling system, write it in a way that people will read it with that pronunciation. (See [[:en:ta:vocabulary:translatenames:transliterate|Transliterate]])
    * Spell the name as it is spelled in the source text or another language, but pronounce the word according to how your language pronounces those symbols.â€‹
    * Translate the meaning of the name.
    * If a person or place has two names, use the name that occurs in the particular text you are translating.
    * If a person or place has two names, use one name most of the time and the other name only when the texts talks about the name or its meaning.
