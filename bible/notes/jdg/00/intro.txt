**What is the Book of Judges about?**
The Book of Judges tells of some events that occurred in Israel over perhaps 150 years. This was a period after the Israelites had settled in the Promised Land and leading up to the death of Samson. 

The theme of this book is how the Israelites repeatedly went against Yahweh by adopting the idolatry and immoral practices of the surrounding peoples. The Israelites then came under the oppression of enemy nations, in which they suffered until they called to Yahweh for help. Yahweh would then bring forward someone to lead the nation to victory and freedom. This person, called a "judge," would then lead Israel or part of Israel in time of peace until he died. 

After that judge's death, the same pattern of events would repeat itself.

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\ 
Many titles summarize the contents of the book. It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). This book traditionally has the title “Judges” because it gives accounts about some of the main leaders of "judges" in Israel before there were any kings over the people.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**Were the judges national or local leaders?**\\
While many of the judges were leaders of the nation of Israel, it appears that some of the judges were leaders of only certain tribes.

**What kind of society was Israel during the time of the Judges?**\\
Rather than a unified nation during this time, Israel was a loose association of twelve tribes. These tribes were descended from the same ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They shared in the same covenant with Yahweh and sometimes helped each other in time of military need.

**What spiritual struggles did Israel experience during the time of the judges?**\\
Israel struggled during this time to remain [[:en:obe:kt:faithful|faithful]] to Yahweh. The best judges encouraged Israel to be faithful to him, but some of the judges did not.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**What is the meaning of the phrase "in those days there was no king in Israel, and everyone did what was right in his own eyes?"**\\
When the author wrote these words, there was a king who ruled the nation of Israel. There also an implication that the author was judging the people (in the period of Judges) for not having a king.  Even though the author believed the people needed a king, they were still wrong for having a king other than Yahweh.

**Should Judges be translated as a series of individual stories?**\\
No. While it is possible to see the book of Judges as a series of individual stories, it should be translated as a single unified book.   

**How should I translate the position of Judge?**\\
"Judge" can be an inaccurate word choice for the position of judge in this book. Despite their names, the Judges were more involved with military battles than with other leadership responsibilities. Their focus is never on [[:en:obe:kt:judge|judging]] between two people or groups of people. Because of this, it may be better to translate using the title "leader," "military leader," "general" or "commander."
