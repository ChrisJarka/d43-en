\v 6 For the people of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness until all the people, even the men of war, that came out of Egypt had died because they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh. Yahweh swore them that he would not let them see the land that Yahweh swore to their ancestors that he would give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 7 So, Joshua circumcised their children that Yahweh raised up in their place because they had not been circumcised on the way.
