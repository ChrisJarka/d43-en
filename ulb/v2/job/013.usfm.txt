\v 1 Lo, mine eye has seen all this,
\q Mine ear has heard and understood it.
\q
\v 2 What you know, the same do I know also:
\q I am not inferior to you.
\b
\q
\v 3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty,
\q And I desire to reason with God.
\q
\v 4 But you are forgers of lies;
\q You are all physicians of no value.
\q
\v 5 Oh that you would altogether hold your peace!
\q And it would be your wisdom.
\q
\v 6 Hear now my reasoning,
\q And listen to the pleadings of my lips.
\q
\v 7 Will you speak unrighteously for God,
\q And talk deceitfully for him?
\q
\v 8 Will you show partiality to him?
\q Will you contend for God?
\q
\v 9 Is it good that he should search you out?
\q Or as one deceiveth a man, will you deceive him?
\q
\v 10 He will surely reprove you,
\q If you do secretly show partiality.
\q
\v 11 Shall not his majesty make you afraid,
\q And his dread fall upon you?
\q
\v 12 Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes,
\q Your defences are defences of clay.
\b
\q
\v 13 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak;
\q And let come on me what will.
\q
\v 14 Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth,
\q And put my life in my hand?
\q
\v 15 Behold, he will kill me; I have no hope:
\q Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.
\q
\v 16 This also shall be my salvation,
\q That a godless man shall not come before him.
\q
\v 17 Hear diligently my speech,
\q And let my declaration be in your ears.
\q
\v 18 Behold now, I have set my cause in order;
\q I know that I am righteous.
\q
\v 19 Who is he that will contend with me?
\q For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost.
\b
\q
\v 20 Only do not two things to me;
\q Then will I not hide myself from your face:
\q
\v 21 Withdraw your hand far from me;
\q And let not your terror make me afraid.
\q
\v 22 Then call thou, and I will answer;
\q Or let me speak, and answer you me.
\q
\v 23 How many are mine iniquities and sins?
\q Make me to know my transgression and my sin.
\q
\v 24 Wherefore hide you your face,
\q And holdest me for your enemy?
\q
\v 25 Wilt you harass a driven leaf?
\q And will you pursue the dry stubble?
\q
\v 26 For you writest bitter things against me,
\q And make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:
\q
\v 27 You put my feet also in the stocks,
\q And markest all my paths;
\q You set a bound to the soles of my feet:
\q
\v 28 Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth,
\q Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
