===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Though this letter from Paul and Timothy to the Colossian believers, later in the book Paul makes it clear that he is the writer. Most likely Timothy was with him and wrote the words down as Paul spoke.

  * **an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God** - "chosen by God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus"
  * **our brother** - Paul includes his audience in the word "our." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **you** - The word "you" here refers to the Colossian saints and faithful believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
