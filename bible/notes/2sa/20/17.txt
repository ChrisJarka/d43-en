\v 17 And he came near to her; and the woman said, Are you Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said to him, Hear the
words of your handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
\v 18 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask
counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.
\v 19 I am of them that are peaceful and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why will
you swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?
