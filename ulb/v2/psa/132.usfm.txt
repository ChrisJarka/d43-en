\d A Song of Ascents.
\q
\v 1 Jehovah, remember for David
\q All his affliction;
\q
\v 2 How he sware to Jehovah,
\q And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
\q
\v 3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house,
\q Nor go up into my bed;
\q
\v 4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes,
\q Or slumber to mine eyelids;
\q
\v 5 Until I find out a place for Jehovah,
\q A tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.
\q
\v 6 Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah:
\q We found it in the field of the wood.
\q
\v 7 We will go into his tabernacles;
\q We will worship at his footstool.
\q
\v 8 Arise, O Jehovah, into your resting-place;
\q Thou, and the ark of your strength.
\q
\v 9 Let your priests be clothed with righteousness;
\q And let your saints shout for joy.
\q
\v 10 For your servant Davidâ€™s sake
\q Turn not away the face of your anointed.
\q
\v 11 Jehovah has sworn to David in truth;
\q He will not turn from it:
\q Of the fruit of your body will I set upon your throne.
\q
\v 12 If your children will keep my covenant
\q And my testimony that I shall teach them,
\q Their children also shall sit upon your throne for evermore.
\q
\v 13 For Jehovah has chosen Zion;
\q He has desired it for his habitation.
\q
\v 14 This is my resting-place for ever:
\q Here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
\q
\v 15 I will abundantly bless her provision:
\q I will satisfy her poor with bread.
\q
\v 16 Her priests also will I clothe with salvation;
\q And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
\q
\v 17 There will I make the horn of David to bud:
\q I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
\q
\v 18 His enemies will I clothe with shame;
\q But upon himself shall his crown flourish.
