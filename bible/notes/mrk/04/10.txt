\v 10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.
\v 11 And he said to them, To you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all things
are done in parables:
\v 12 that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn
again, and it should be forgiven them.
