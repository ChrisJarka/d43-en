\v 8 Then Judah said to Onan, "Your older brother died without having any sons. So marry his widow and have sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with her. That is what our customs require that you should do."
\v 9 But Onan knew if he did that, any children who would be born would not be considered to be his. So every time he had sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with his brother's widow, he spilled his semen on the ground, so that she would not get pregnant and produce children for his older brother.
\v 10 Yahweh considered that what he did was wicked, so he caused him to die also.

\v 8 Judah said to Onan, "Make love to your brother’s wife. Do the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up a child for your brother."
