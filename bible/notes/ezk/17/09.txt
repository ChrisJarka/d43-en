\v 9 Say thou, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit
thereof, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? and not by a strong arm or much people can it be
raised from the roots thereof.
\v 10 Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind touches it? it shall
wither in the beds where it grew.
