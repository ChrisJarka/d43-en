====== Introduction to Hebrews ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of Hebrews ===

  - Jesus is superior to God's prophets and angels (1:1-4:13)
  - Jesus is superior to the priests who serve in the temple in Jerusalem (4:14-7:28)
  - Jesus' ministry is superior to the old covenant that God made with his people (8:1-10:39)
  - What faith is like (11:1-40)
  - Encouragement to be faithful to God (12:1-29)
  - Concluding encouragements and greetings (13:1-25)

=== What is the Book of Hebrews about? ===

In the Book of Hebrews, the author wanted to show that Jesus fulfilled several Old Testament prophecies. Jesus' role as the perfect High Priest is explained; the author did this in order to encourage the Jewish Christians and to explain that Jesus is better than anything that the old covenant had to offer.  Hebrews shows how Jesus completed the law of Moses, so that animal sacrifices would from then on be useless. Jesus was the sacrifice for all sins, once and for all time. He is therefore the one to truly trust for access to God the Father.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Hebrews." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "The Letter to the Hebrews," or "A Letter to the Jewish Christians." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Hebrews? ===

No one knows who wrote Hebrews, but scholars have made suggestions such as the Apostle Paul, Luke, or Barnabas.  The date of writing is also not known, but most believe it was written not more than seventy years after the birth of Christ.  Jerusalem was destroyed in A.D. 70, but the writer of this letter talks about Jerusalem as if it had not yet been destroyed.  

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Can readers understand this book without knowing about the sacrifices and the work of the priests required in the Old Testament? ===

It would be very difficult for readers to understand this book with understanding these matters. Translators might consider giving some explanations to this effect in notes or in an introduction to this book.
