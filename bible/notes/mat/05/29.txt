\v 29 And if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you; for it is better for you that one
of your body parts should perish, than that your whole body should be thrown into hell.
\v 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you; for it is better for you that one
of your body parts should perish, than that your whole body should go into hell.
