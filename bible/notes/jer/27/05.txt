\v 5 “I myself made the earth, the ground, and the beasts that are on the surface of the ground by my great strength and my outstretched arm; and I have given it to the one who is right in my eyes.
\v 6 So now, I myself give all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant. Also, I give the living things of the field to him to serve him.
\v 7 For all the nations will serve him, his sons, and his sons’ sons until the time of his land comes also to him. Then many nations and great kings will serve against him!
