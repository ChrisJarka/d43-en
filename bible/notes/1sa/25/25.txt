\v 25 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name,
and folly is with him: but I your handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom you did send.
\v 26 Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah liveth, and as your soul liveth, seeing Jehovah has withholden you from
bloodguiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies, and them that seek evil to my
lord, be as Nabal.
