\c 63
\d A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.
\q
\v 1 O God, you are my God; earnestly will I seek thee:
\q My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee,
\q In a dry and weary land, where no water is.
\q
\v 2 So have I looked upon you in the sanctuary,
\q To see your power and your glory.
\q
\v 3 Because your lovingkindness is better than life,
\q My lips shall praise thee.
\q
\v 4 So will I bless you while I live:
\q I will lift up my hands in your name.
\q
\v 5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness;
\q And my mouth shall praise you with joyful lips;
\q
\v 6 When I remember you upon my bed,
\q And meditate on you in the night-watches.
\q
\v 7 For you have been my help,
\q And in the shadow of your wings will I rejoice.
\q
\v 8 My soul follows hard after thee:
\q Your right hand upholdeth me.
\q
\v 9 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it,
\q Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
\q
\v 10 They shall be given over to the power of the sword:
\q They shall be a portion for foxes.
\q
\v 11 But the king shall rejoice in God:
\q Every one that swears by him shall glory;
\q For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
