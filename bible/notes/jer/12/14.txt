\v 14 This is also what Yahweh said to me: "I will punish the evil nearby nations that have been trying to take away the land that I gave to my Israelite people, and I will force them to leave their own land. But I will throw the people of Judah out of their land, also.
\v 15 But later I will act mercifully toward those nations again, and I will bring them back to their own lands again. Each \add clan\add* will come back to its own land.

\v 14 Thus says Jehovah against all mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to
inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
\v 15 And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring
them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
