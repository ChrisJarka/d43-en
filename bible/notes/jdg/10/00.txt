== Israel's sin ==
 
"The people of Israel added to the evil they had done in the sight of Yahweh and worshiped the Baals, the Ashtoreths, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the people of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. They abandoned Yahweh and no longer worshiped him. Yahweh burned with anger toward Israel, and he gave them to the Philistines and to the Ammonites, to conquer them."
