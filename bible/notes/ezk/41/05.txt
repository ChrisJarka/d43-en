====== Ezekiel 41:5-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Then he measured the wall of the temple: it was 10.5 ft.\f + \ft Or: 3.2 meters \f* thick. Each of the rooms around the outside of the temple were 7 ft.\f + \ft Or: 2.1 meters \f* wide.
\v 6 Those rooms had three levels, one above the other. There were thirty rooms on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple that were supports for those side rooms; so those supports were not built into the wall of the temple.
\v 7 Each of those side rooms was wider than the one below it. The most narrow rooms were built first, at the bottom. Then a wider set of rooms was built over it, and the widest set was at the top. A set of stairs was built from the lowest level through the middle level to the highest level.

\v 5 Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the
house on every side.
\v 6 And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which
belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold
therein, and not have hold in the wall of the house.
\v 7 And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed the house
higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the breadth
of the house continued upward; and so one went up from the lowest
chamber to the highest by the middle chamber.
