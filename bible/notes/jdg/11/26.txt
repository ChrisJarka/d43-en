\v 26 While Israel lived for three hundred years in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are along by the banks of the Arnon—why then did you not take them back during that time?
\v 27 I have not done you wrong, but you are doing me wrong to war against me. Yahweh, the Judge, will decide today between the people of Israel and the people of Ammon.”
\v 28 But the king of the people of Ammon rejected the warning Jephthah sent him.
