====== hope ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "hope" refers to expecting and strongly desiring something to happen. Often it means to not be certain that it will happen. 

  * In the Bible, the term "hope" also has the meaning of trust as in, "my hope is in the Lord." It refers to a sure expectation of receiving what God has promised his people. 
  * The meaning of having a sure expectation is translated as "confidence" in the ULB, in order to communicate the meaning of being sure or certain about something.
  * To have "no hope" means to have no expectation of something good happening. It means that it is actually very certain that it will not happen.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * In most contexts in the ULB, the term "to hope" could also be translated as "to wish" or "to desire" or "to expect."
  * The expression, "nothing to hope for" could be translated as "nothing to trust in" or "no expectation of anything good"
  * To "have no hope" could be translated as, "have no expectation of anything good" or "have no security" or "be sure that nothing good will happen."
  * The expression, "have set your hopes on" could also be translated as "have put your confidence in" or "have been trusting in."
