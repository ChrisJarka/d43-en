===== Section Headings =====

This module answers the question: What kind of section headings should we use?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:checking:acceptable|Acceptable Style]]

 * Have you decided to indicate section headings? If you are using section headings, which kind has the translation team decided to use (see examples below)? How does the national language handle section headings? (Is the community satisfied with the decisions of the translation team?) Be sure to use a kind of section heading that the people will understand is not part of the text that it introduces. 

Examples of section headings for Mark 2:1-12: 
  -Summary statement: “By healing a paralyzed man, Jesus demonstrated his authority to forgive sins as well as to heal.” 
  -Explanatory comment: “Jesus heals a paralyzed man.” 
  -Topical reference: “Cure of a paralytic.” 
  -Question: "Does Jesus have authority to heal and forgive sins?"
  -"About" comment: "About Jesus healing a paralyzed man."
