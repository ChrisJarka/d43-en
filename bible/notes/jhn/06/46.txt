  * **(Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God—he has seen the Father.)** - John is adding his own insight. Whatever words you use to show that this is an important part of the story, you can use such words here. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:discourse:background]])
  * **Truly, truly** - This is a way of marking emphasis, (“Listen! This is important!”) Translate it however you would add emphasis to an important phrase in your language. (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])
