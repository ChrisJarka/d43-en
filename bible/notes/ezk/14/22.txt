\v 22 Yet, behold! A remnant will be left in her, survivors who will go out with sons and daughters. Behold! They will go out to you, 
and you will see their ways and actions and be comforted concerning the punishment that I have sent to Jerusalem, and about everything 
else that I have sent against the land.
\v 23 The survivors will comfort you when you see their ways and their actions; so you will know all these things that  
I have done against her—I have not done them in vain!" This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
