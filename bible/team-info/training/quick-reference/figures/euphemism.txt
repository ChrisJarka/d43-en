===== Bible Examples =====

=== Act:05:10 ===

"She instantly fell down at his feet, and breathed her last, and the young men came in and found her dead; they carried her out and buried her by her husband."

  * **breathed her last**  - This is a euphemism for "she died." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:euphemism|Euphemism]])

=== Gen:04:25 ===

"Adam had marital relations with his wife again, and she bore another son. "

  * **had marital relations**  - “had sex with.” Your language may have a way of saying this politely. Some languages say “knew” or “slept with.” (See: [[:en:ta:translate:euphemism|Euphemism]])

=== Luk:08:43 ===

"A woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years and had spent all her money on physicians, but could not be healed by any of them."

  * **had been bleeding**  - "had a flow of blood." She was probably bleeding from her womb even when it was not the normal time for it. Some cultures may have a polite way of referring to this condition. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:euphemism|Euphemism]])
