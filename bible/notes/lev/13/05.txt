\v 5 Then the priest must examine him on the seventh day to see if in his view the disease is not any worse, and it has not spread in the skin. If it has not, then the priest must isolate him seven days more.
\v 6 Then the priest will examine him again on the seventh day to see if the disease is better and it has not spread farther in the skin. If it has not then the priest will pronounce him clean.  It is a rash. He must wash his clothes and then he is clean.
