<usfm> \v 10 Now think carefully about these words, which you have read in the Scriptures: \p "The men who were building the building refused to use a certain stone. But the Lord has put that same stone in its proper place, and it has become the most important stone in the building! \v 11 The Lord has done this, and we marvel as we look at it." \p \v 12 Then the Jewish leaders realized that Jesus was accusing them when he told this story about what those wicked people did. So they wanted to arrest him. But they were afraid of what the crowds would do if they did that. So they left him and went away.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Have you not read this scripture?**  - This is a rhetorical question meaning "surely, you have read this scripture." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **'The stone which the builders rejected, has been made the cornerstone. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes.'**  - Jesus is quoting Psalm 118:22-23. He is now giving the meaning of the parable that he told in 12:1-9. The grape farmers are the religious leaders. The grape vineyard is the people of God. The religious leaders were to care for the people and help them to become better followers of God. Instead, the leaders made the people do many things that God never commanded and they killed God's son.
  * **The stone which the builders rejected has been made the cornerstone**  - This is comparing Jesus as the foundation of God's kingdom to a stone that becomes a cornerstone (the most important foundation stone) in a physical building. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]]) Jesus is the foundation of God's kingdom whom the religious leaders will reject but whom God the Father will make the foundation of God's kingdom.
  * **This was from the Lord**  - God the Father made Jesus the foundation of his kingdom.
  * **marvelous in our eyes **  - Jesus becoming the foundation of God's kingdom is wonderful to those who recognize him as God's Son.
  * **They sought to arrest Jesus**  - The religious leaders saw Jesus as a threat to their power.
  * **They feared the crowd**  - "The leaders were afraid of the people's reaction". Most people thought Jesus was a man of God.
