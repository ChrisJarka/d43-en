\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
\v 2 the same came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do
these signs that you doest, except God be with him.
\v 3 Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of
God.
\v 4 Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be
born?
\v 5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God.
\v 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
\v 7 Marvel not that I said to thee, You must be born anew.
\v 8 The wind blows where it will, and you hear the voice thereof, but know not whence it cometh, and whither it
goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to him, Are you the teacher of Israel, and understand not these things?
\v 11 Verily, verily, I say to thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and you receive
not our witness.
\v 12 If I told you earthly things and you believe not, how shall you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
\v 13 And no one has ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven,
even the Son of man, who is in heaven.
\v 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up;
\v 15 that whoever believes may in him have eternal life.
\p
\v 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes on him should not perish, but
have eternal life.
\v 17 For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.
\v 18 He that believes on him is not judged: he that believes not has been judged already, because he has not believed on
the name of the only begotten Son of God.
\v 19 And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for
their works were evil.
\v 20 For every one that does evil hates the light, and comes not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.
\v 21 But he that does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God.
\p
\v 22 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
\v 23 And John also was baptizing in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
\v 24 For John was not yet cast into prison.
\v 25 There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purifying.
\v 26 And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have borne
witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.
\v 27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven.
\v 28 You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.
\v 29 He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that stands and hears him, rejoices
greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is made full.
\v 30 He must increase, but I must decrease.
\p
\v 31 He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that
comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 What he has seen and heard, of that he bears witness; and no man receiveth his witness.
\v 33 He that has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.
\v 34 For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for he gives not the Spirit by measure.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
\v 36 He that believes on the Son has eternal life; but he that obeys not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God
remains on him.
