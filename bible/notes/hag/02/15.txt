\v 15 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of Jehovah.
\v 16 Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the
winevat to draw out fifty vessels, there were but twenty.
\v 17 I struck you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; yout you
turned not to me, says Jehovah.
