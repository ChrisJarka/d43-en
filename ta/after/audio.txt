===== Record the Audio =====

Another great way to help people understand Open Bible Stories is to record someone reading a translation of Open Bible Stories that has been checked to Level 3. If you are interested in recording the Stories, please contact Brad at [[brad@unfoldingword.org]]. He will help you to do a high quality recording of these Stories.
