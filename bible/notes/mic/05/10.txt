===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in that day** - - "at that time" or "when I do those things." These words refer to "the last days" ([[:en:bible:notes:mic:04:01|4:1]]). The word "day" can refer to a period of days or even years.
  * **I will destroy your horses from among you and will demolish your chariots** - The people of Israel used horses and chariots only in battle, and they may have traded for them with the godless nations around them. God did not want the people to trust in their weapons of war to protect them more than they trusted in him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
