\v 6 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?
\v 7 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah: but I hate him; for
he never prophesieth good concerning me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not
the king say so.
\v 8 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
