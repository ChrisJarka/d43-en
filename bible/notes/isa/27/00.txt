====== Isaiah 27 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 26, which is an important quotation. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Leviathan ==
This was an ancient type of dragon or serpent. It is possible that this is a reference to Satan, who is also described as a serpent and a dragon.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "That day" ==
It appears that some aspects of this prophecy are still to be fulfilled in the last day before or when Yahweh reigns on earth in Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])
