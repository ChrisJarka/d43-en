=== What is the book of Matthew about? ===

The Gospel according to Matthew is one of four books in the New Testament that describe the life of Jesus Christ. They are four stories, each told from a different perspective. He intended to show that Jesus was the Messiah, God’s chosen savior. Matthew explains to his reader that Jesus fulfills the Old Testament prophecies about the messiah. He also explains why the messiah did not deliver Israel from Rome. It was likely intended bring the Jewish people to a saving faith in Christ.


=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Matthew" may also be called "The Gospel according to Matthew" or "This is what Matthew wrote about Jesus."

=== Who wrote the Book of Matthew? ===

The author is Matthew, who was a tax collector before Jesus asked him to become his disciple.  He was also known by the name Levi.  Matthew was one of the twelve Apostles and he wrote for Jewish readers.

Scholars do not know the exact date when the gospel according to Matthew was written, but it was possibly sometime around 60 years after the birth of Christ.  Also, the place where it was written is not known, but many guess that it was written in Palestine and maybe even in the city of Jerusalem. 


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
=== Should I translate Jewish customs? ===

Since Matthew's intended audience is Jewish, he does not explain Jewish cultural or religious customs. The translator may need to put this information in a footnote.



===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the "kingdom of God?" ===

The kingdom of God is used in the same way as the "kingdom of heaven." Matthew uses these terms to refers to the reign of the messiah on earth and in reference to God's universal reign over the whole earth. Some scholars believe that there is a spiritual kingdom in the hearts of men where Christ reigns.

=== How do I translate "You have heard … but I say"? ===
This is a way the speaker contrast the views of the Pharisees with what Scripture actually teaches. There is an implicit understanding that, because the Pharisees made their own law to follow in addition to Scripture, they had abandoned the teachings of the Law of Moses.

=== Why does Matthew often refer to Jesus as the "son of man"? ===
This is a reference to a prophecy in Daniel chapter 9 where the son of man rides on the clouds in glory. It emphasizes the fact that Jesus is both fully man and fully God.
