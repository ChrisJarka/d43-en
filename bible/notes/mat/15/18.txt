===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 18 Instead, the evil words that the mouth speaks are what makes God reject a person, because they comes from the evil things that the person thinks in his innermost being. \v 19 This is because it is people's innermost beings that cause them to think things that are evil, to murder people, to commit adultery, to commit other sexual sins, to steal things, to testify falsely, and to speak evil about others. \v 20 It is these actions that cause God to consider people to be unacceptable to him. But to eat with unwashed hands does not cause God to reject people."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 18 But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. They are the things that defile a person. \v 19 For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, acts of murder, acts of adultery, acts of fornication, acts of theft, and acts of false witness and insults. \v 20 These are the things that defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a person. </usfm>
