**Example from the Bible ** 


    * My noble friend Theophilus, many people saw the things that Jesus did while he was with __us__, from the time when he started his ministry. They served God by teaching people the message about the Lord Jesus. Many of those who heard what they taught wrote down for us accounts of the things that Jesus did from the time when he began his ministry. Luke 1 1-2 (TFT)


//This example uses the word __us__  which means a separate group. In verse 1:1 __us__  means those people that were physically with Jesus when Jesus was on earth.// 


    * And as you wish that __others__  would do to you, do so to __them__. Luke 6:31 (ESV)


//This example uses the words __others__  and __them__  which again is referring to specific groups of people but does not include the person being spoken to.//
