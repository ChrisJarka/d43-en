\v 9 But we do not have to let our self-directed nature \add control us\add*. Instead, we can \add let\add* God's Spirit \add control us\add*, because he lives within us. If people do not have \add living in them\add* the Spirit \add who comes from\add* Christ, they do not belong to Christ.
\v 10 But since Christ \add is living in you\f + \ft Or: us \f* by his Spirit, although\add* your\f + \ft Or: our \f* bodies \add are certain to\add* die because you\f + \ft Or: we \f* sin, your\f + \ft Or: our \f* spirits are alive because God has erased the record of your\f + \ft Or: our \f* sins.

\v 9 But we do not have to let our self-directed nature control us. Instead, we can let God's Spirit control us, because he lives within us. If people do not have living in them the Spirit who comes from Christ, they do not belong to Christ.

\v 9 But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if someone does not have the Spirit of Christ, this one is not his.
