\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal and
one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and
there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.
\v 2 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son
of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
\v 3 Ishmael also killed all the Jews that were with him, to wit, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were
found there, the men of war.
