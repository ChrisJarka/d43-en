===== Digital Publishing Engine =====

The Digital Publishing Engine is a system of pushing checked translations to the [[http://unfoldingWord.org/stories|unfoldingWord website]] and [[en:ta:before:uwapp|app]] and creating print-ready documents of the content. Only an unfoldingWord admin may use the digital publishing engine.
