==== Description ====

Normally commands are used to tell someone to do something. Sometimes they are used in the Bible for other functions.

**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages would not use a command for some of the functions that commands are used for in the Bible.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

Commands are normally used to tell someone to do something. 

A command can also be used like a conditional statement. The speaker below is not telling people [[Susan, look for an example where it's clearly not something that someone should do. Such as Abandon wisdom and she will abandon you.]]
>do not abandon wisdom and she will watch over you; 
> love her and she will keep you safe. (Proverbs 4:6 ULB)

A command can also be used to perform something. In the example below, the man could not heal himself of his leprosy. When Jesus told him to be clean, that is, to be healed, Jesus actually healed him by commanding it.
> “I am willing. Be clean.” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. (Matthew 8:3 ULB)

In the command below, God not only commanded that there should be light, but he caused it to exist.
>God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. (Genesis 1:3 ULB)


==== Translation Strategies ====
  - If the function of a command would not be understood correctly in your language, __use a sentence type__ that would express that function.
  - If the function of a command would not be understood correctly in your language, __add a sentence type__ that would express that function.
  - If the function of a command would not be understood correctly in your language, __use a verb form__ that would express that function.
