====== Original Languages ======


The average user of the Bible translation apps will not be a professional translator, and may not have any formal biblical training.

However, since they will not have the background to make decisions about the original languages, we will simply present them with the preferred meaning or meanings. Since most of these decisions have have already been made in the translation of the ULB and UDB, those should normally be the preferred options. Therefore, here are suggested wordings:

|  **Do NOT Write**  |  **Do Write**  |

|This literally means "...|This could be translated as "...|
|The original Hebrew word can have multiple meanings...|Possible meanings are 1) "preferred meaning" or 2) "other meaning"...|





==== Disputed Text ====

  * Do not debate the critical textual evidence for various manuscripts in the notes. Instead, even
