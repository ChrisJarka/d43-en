\v 26 That is a small thing to do. So since you cannot do that, you certainly should not worry about other things that \add you need to have in order to live!\add*\f + \ft Or: why do you worry about other things that \add you need to have in order to live\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 24 Consider the ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn; and God feeds them: of how much more value are you than the birds!
\v 25 And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit the least amount to the measure of his life?
\v 26 If then you are not able to do even that which is least, why are you anxious concerning the rest?
