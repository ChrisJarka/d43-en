\v 31 When Moses saw it, he was amazed, because the bush was not burning up. As he went over to look more closely, he heard the Lord God say to him,
\v 32 'I am the God whom your ancestors worshipped. I am the God that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob worship.' Moses was so afraid that he began to shake. He was afraid to look at the bush any longer.

\v 31 When Moses saw the fire, he marvelled at the sight; and as he approached to look at it, there came a voice of the Lord, saying,
\v 32 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob.' Moses trembled  and did not dare to look.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **trembled**  - Moses shook from fear.
  * **as he approached to look at itâ€¦trembled and did not dare to look **- the word for translated "look" in both these places means, "to look closely, or examine". It might mean that Moses backed off from his study of the burning bush, rather then that he averted his eyes entirely.
