====== First, Second or Third Person ======

First person is written from the speaker’s point of view.  The pronoun “I” or “we” is used from the position of the speaker or writer.  An example is “I gave the dog a bone.”

Second person text tells what ‘you’ have done or ought to do.  For example, “You gave the dog a bone.”

Third person is told from the perspective of someone outside of the story.  The pronouns “he”, “she”, “it” or “they” are used.  An example is “She gave the dog a bone.”

First person is the most common form used in speech; second person is used as a form of instruction; and third person is used as narration to express the view and knowledge of the narrator.
