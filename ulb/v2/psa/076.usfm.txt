\c 76
\d For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a song.
\q
\v 1 In Judah is God known:
\q His name is great in Israel.
\q
\v 2 In Salem also is his tabernacle,
\q And his dwelling-place in Zion.
\q
\v 3 There he brake the arrows of the bow;
\q The shield, and the sword, and the battle. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 Glorious are you and excellent,
\q From the mountains of prey.
\q
\v 5 The stouthearted are made a spoil,
\q They have slept their sleep;
\q And none of the men of might have found their hands.
\q
\v 6 At your rebuke, O God of Jacob,
\q Both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
\q
\v 7 Thou, even thou, are to be feared;
\q And who may stand in your sight when once you are angry?
\q
\v 8 You did cause sentence to be heard from heaven;
\q The earth feared, and was still,
\q
\v 9 When God arose to judgment,
\q To save all the meek of the earth. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee:
\q The residue of wrath shall you gird upon thee.
\q
\v 11 Vow, and pay to Jehovah your God:
\q Let all that are round about him bring presents to him that ought to be feared.
\q
\v 12 He will cut off the spirit of princes:
\q He is terrible to the kings of the earth.
