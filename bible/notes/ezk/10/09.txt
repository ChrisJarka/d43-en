<usfm> \p \v 9 So I looked, and behold! Four wheels were beside the cherubim—one wheel beside each cherub—and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone. \v 10 They appeared in the same likeness for all four of them, like a wheel intersecting another wheel. \v 11 When they moved, they went in any direction; they did not turn when they moved since they moved to the place where the head faced. They did not turn when they moved. </usfm>
