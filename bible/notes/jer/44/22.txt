\v 22 so that Jehovah could not longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have
committed; therefore is your land become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.
\v 23 Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyoud the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened to you, as it is this day.
