====== Pharisee ======


===== Definition: =====


The Pharisees were an important group of Israel's religious leaders in Jesus' day.


    * In Scripture, the Pharisees are often mentioned along with Sadducees because they were the two major parties of Israel's religious council, the Sanhedrin.
    * The Pharisees, unlike the Sadducees, believed in the resurrection of the dead and taught more restrictive laws and traditions than the Law of Moses.
