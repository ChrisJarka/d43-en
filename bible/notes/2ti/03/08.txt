\v 8 In the same way that Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these men now oppose the trueth. They are men who are ruined in the mind. They fraudulent in matters of the faith.
\v 9 Nevertheless, they will not advance very far, because most people will  clearly see that such people lack understanding, just like people also  clearly saw what kind of persons Jannes and Jambres had become.
