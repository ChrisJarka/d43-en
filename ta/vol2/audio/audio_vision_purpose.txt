===== Vision & Purpose =====

This module answers the question: //What is the vision and purpose of the audio manual?//\\
===  ===

The vision of unfoldingWord Audio Engineering is to serve and equip the global Church to make and distribute excellent, unrestrictable audio recordings of Biblical content in sub-optimal conditions. The recommendations, skills-training and tips provided here are developed for, by and with the global Church as solutions to empower a world-wide team of media creators to envision and drive their own projects with skill, excellence, wisdom and longevity for their own people groups, using the localized strategies they know best.

Today, the need for Biblical content to be available in audio format is as significant as any time in history. As much as 80% of all people live in oral culture communities. For those living in literate-based societies, many of them people learn best, if not exclusively by listening (aural learning). Billions of people need a solution engineered that can go the distance where conventional strategies and methods have limited effectiveness and restricted access.

This manual, like all unfoldingWord content, is licensed CC BY-SA to make it irrevocably accessible to the global Church. The knowledge, practical skills and recommendations are carefully selected and continually updated to identify the best practices, optimized equipment and cost-effective distribution of Biblical content in real-world conditions. 

By combining open resources, skills-training, a God-inspired global Church team of media creators, tremendous advancements in digital recording technology and the proliferation of affordable devices, locally-sustainable, for offline listening and sharing, we that this vast need of the global Church can be met for the first time.

May this manual encourage you and equip you in the work God calls you to.
