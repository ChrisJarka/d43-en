====== Explicit and Implicit Information ======


//This page answers the question: What do the words explicit and implicit mean?// 

There are two types of written and spoken communication, explicit and implicit information.

  * Explicit information is what the speaker states clearly.
  * Implicit information is what the speaker not state clearly because he expects his audience to be able to understand it from what he does say.
  * Old knowledge is what the speaker expects his audience to know and think about in order to understand what he is saying.
==== Description ====

When someone speaks or writes, he has in mind a certain audience who is either listening to him or will read what he writes. He has a good idea of what his audience does and does not know, and so he chooses to tell them important things that they do not already know. Normally he does not tell them things that he believes they already know. And sometimes he does not state clearly things that expects them to be able to understand from what he says. 

The things that he states clearly are explicit information. The things that he expects them to already know and be able to use to understand his message are implicit information. The things that he does not state clearly but he expects people to learn from his message are also implicit information.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>Jesus said to him, "Foxes __have holes__, and the birds of the sky __have nests__, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."  (Matthew 8:20 ULB)

Jesus did not say what foxes and birds use holes and nests for, because the people he was speaking to would have known that foxes sleep in holes in the ground and birds sleep in their nests. This is implicit information.

> Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But it will be more tolerable for __Tyre and Sidon__ at the day of judgment than for you.  (Matthew 11:21, 22 ULB)

The people of Tyre and Sidon were very wicked, and the day of judgment is a time when God will judge every person. This is implicit information that the people that Jesus was speaking to would have thought about in order to understand what he was saying. And even though the people he was speaking to had seen his mighty deeds, they had not repented. So they would be judged more severely than the people of Tyre and Sidon would be judged. This is implicit information that Jesus wanted them to learn from what he said. 

>Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not wash their hands when they eat__. (Matthew 15:2 ULB)

One of the traditions of the elders was a ceremony in which people would wash their hands in order to be ritually clean before eating. People thought that in order to be righteous, they had to follow all the traditions of the elders. This was implicit information that the Pharisees who were speaking to Jesus expected him to know. They were rebuking him because his disciples did not follow the traditions. This is implicit information that they wanted him to understand from what they said.
