\v 13 But the Israelite people rebelled against me in the desert. They did not obey my commands; they rejected them, even though they would have lived a long time if they had obeyed them, and they profaned the Sabbath days. So I said that I would get rid of them in the desert, and that would show that I was very angry with them.
\v 14 But again, for the sake of my own reputation, I decided to do something in order that I would not be dishonored by the people of the nations who had seen it when I brought my people out of Egypt.

\v 13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not walk in my statutes but rejected my judgments that if a 
man does them he will live by them. They greatly profaned my Sabbaths, so I said I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness 
in order to end them.
\v 14 But I acted for my nameâ€™s sake so it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I brought them out.
