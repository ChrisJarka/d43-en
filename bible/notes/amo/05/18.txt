\v 18 Woe to you that desire the day of Jehovah! Wherefore would you have the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light.
\v 19 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a
serpent bit him.
\v 20 Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
