\v 12 If you say, "I did not know anything about it, \add so it is not my concern\f + \ft Or: I did not try to help him \f*\add*,"
\q2 remember that God knows what we have done,

<usfm>
\v 11 Rescue the ones who are being carried away to the slaughter—
\q2 they stagger and fall—hold them back from the one who would kill them.
\q1
\v 12 If you say, "I did not know anything about it."
\q2 Does not God, who knows our motives, also know what you meant when you said it?  
\q2 And the God who guards your life, how could he not know what you said? 
\q2 Will he not give to each one according to what he deserves?


\q1
\v 13 My child, eat honey, because it tastes good;
\q2 the honeycomb is sweet.
\q1
\v 14 Wisdom is like the honeycomb, it feeds your life, if you can find it. 
\q2 If you can find it, you will have a future, 
\q2 and you will come to the future with hope that will not be cut short.

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 Rescue those who are being taken away to death—
\q those who are staggering to the slaughter—if you can hold them back.
\q
\v 12 If you say, "There! we knew nothing about this."
\q Does not the One who weighs the heart understand what you are saying?
\q And the One who guards your life, does he not know it?
\q And will God not give to each one according to what he has done?
\q
\v 13 My child, eat honey because it is good
\q and the drippings of honeycomb are sweet to your taste.
\q
\v 14 Such is wisdom for your soul—
\q if you find it, there will be a future
\q and your hope will not be cut off.
