\v 5 For who will have compassion for you, Jerusalem? Who will grieve for you?
\q Who will turn to ask for your peace?

\v 6 You have forsaken me!—this is Yahweh’s declaration—You have gone back!

\q
\v 7 So I will winnow them with a pitchfork in the gates of the land!
\q I will bereave them! I will destroy my people since they would not turn from their ways!
