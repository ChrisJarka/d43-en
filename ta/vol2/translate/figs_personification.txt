===== Personification =====

This module answers the question: What is personification?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

Personification is a figure of speech in which the speaker or writer gives human characteristics to  ideas.  Personification helps a writer to describe something in a more vivid or life-like way. It adds depth to writing and helps the reader 'feel' the subject matter more fully. 
===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * If the personification would be understood correctly, use it.
  * Using the words "like" or "as" can help clarify that this is a figure of speech, as in 1 Thessalonians 5:4, "...that the day should overtake you __like__  a thief."
  * If the personification would not be understood correctly, find a way to translate the meaning without the personification. 
  
===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you.** Proverbs 2:11 ULB - The concepts of discretion and understanding are spoken of as if they are a person who can watch and guard.  This can be restated as "Because you have discretion and understanding you will not do the wrong thing" or “Because you know what is right and wrong you will not be making mistakes.” 

 **justice will reside…righteousness will live** Isaiah 32:16 ULB - Isaiah describes “justice” and “righteousness” as a person who lives in a place. This can be restated as "the people who live in these places will do what is just and right." 
 
===== Examples from English =====
**That delicious looking dessert is calling out to me, "Eat me. Eat me."** This personification helps to show how tempted the speaker feels to eat the cake. It also implies that the responsibility for the speaker's choice to eat the cake belongs to the cake.\\ 
\\ 
**The raging fire devoured everything in its way.** \\
This description of the fire helps show how terrifying and destructive it was by comparing it to a hungry person or animal that wanted to eat everything around it.
