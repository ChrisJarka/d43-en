\v 1 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Do not fear, do not be discouraged. Get up! Take all the people of war with you. Go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.
\v 2 Then you will do to Ai and her king as you have done to Jericho and her king. Only the plunder and the cattle you will take for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it."
