  * [[:en:obe:kt:wise|wise, wisdom, understanding]]

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **is the number of a human being**  - Possible meanings are 1) "of a human being", 2) "of a man", or 3) "represents mankind" (UDB).
    * **number of** - This probably is based on the practice of "gematria", by which people converted words into numbers, so they could say in code something they did not want to express openly.
    * **666**  - This means "six hundred and sixty-six" in the original, not the three numerals 6, 6, and 6.
