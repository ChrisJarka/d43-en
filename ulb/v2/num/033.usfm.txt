\v 1 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the
hand of Moses and Aaron.
\v 2 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Jehovah: and these are their journeys
according to their goings out.
\v 3 And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the
passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,
\v 4 while the Egyptians were burying all their first-born, whom Jehovah had struck among them: upon their gods also Jehovah
executed judgments.
\p

daysâ€™ journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in Marah.

\v 37 And they journeyed from Kadesh, and encamped in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.
\p
\v 38 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of Jehovah, and died there, in the forties year after the
children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.
\v 39 And Aaron was a hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.
\p

\p
\v 50 And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
\v 51 Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
\v 52 then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured
stones, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places:
\v 53 and you shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for to you have I given the land to possess it.
\v 54 And you shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to
the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his; according to the
tribes of your fathers shall you inherit.
\v 55 But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that you let remain of them be
as pricks in your eyous, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell.
\v 56 And it shall come to pass, that, as I thought to do to them, so will I do to you.
