\v 34 But now listen to what I say to you: Never promise to do anything and then ask a superior being to affirm that what you are saying will happen. For example, do not promise that you will give something and then ask spiritual beings in heaven to affirm that you will do it, because heaven is where God sits on his throne to rule over people.
\v 35 Also, do not promise that you will give something and then ask spiritual beings on earth to affirm that you will do it, because the earth is where God rests his feet. Also, do not promise that you will do something and ask religious authorities in Jerusalem to affirm that you will do it, because Jerusalem is the city where God, the great King rules.

\v 33 Again, you have heard that it was said to those in ancient times, 'You will not perjure yourself, but you will carry out your oaths to the
Lord.'
\v 34 But I say to you, swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
\v 35 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool for his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
