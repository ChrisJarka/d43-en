\v 13 And, behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus says Jehovah, Hast you seen all this great
multitude? behold, I will deliver it into your hand this day; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
\v 14 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus says Jehovah, By the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, Thou.
\v 15 Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
