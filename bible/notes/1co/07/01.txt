\v 1 Now \add I will reply to\add* the things that you wrote to me about.
\p It is good for people not to get married.
\v 2 But because many people are committing sexual immorality, \add which God detests\add*, every man should have his own wife \add with whom he can have sexual relations\add*, and every woman should have her own husband \add with whom she can have sexual relations\add*.

\v 1 You wrote to me about the matter of sexual purity within the Christian faith. This is my reply about those  matters. There may be times in which it is good to abstain from sexual relations in marriage. Sexual relations may be avoided during difficult times and for spiritual purposes. Marriage is never to be forbidden, but it should be honored. But those who marry and those who do not, need to be clear about their reasons for choosing either role.
\v 2 The world is filled with temptations to sin in sexual relations. Marriage is a strong defence against sexual sin, but not the only one. If every man had his wife and every wife had her husband, matters might be simpler.

\v 1 Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me--there may be times when it is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.
\v 2 But because of temptations for many immoralities, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband.
