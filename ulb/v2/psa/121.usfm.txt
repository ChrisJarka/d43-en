\c 121
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q
\v 1 I will lift up mine eyes to the mountains:
\q From whence shall my help come?
\q
\v 2 My help comes from Jehovah,
\q Who made heaven and earth.
\b
\q
\v 3 He will not suffer your foot to be moved:
\q He that keeps you will not slumber.
\q
\v 4 Behold, he that keeps Israel
\q Will neither slumber nor sleep.
\q
\v 5 Jehovah is your keeper:
\q Jehovah is your shade upon your right hand.
\q
\v 6 The sun shall not strike you by day,
\q Nor the moon by night.
\q
\v 7 Jehovah will keep you from all evil;
\q He will keep your soul.
\q
\v 8 Jehovah will keep your going out and your coming in
\q From this time forth and for evermore.
