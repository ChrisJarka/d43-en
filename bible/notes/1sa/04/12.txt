\v 12 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent, and with earth
upon his head.
\v 13 And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God.
And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
