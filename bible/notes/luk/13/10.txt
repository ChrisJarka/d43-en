===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (One Sabbath Jesus teaches people in a synagogue.)
    * **during the Sabbath**  - That is, "on the Sabbath day."
    * **And note**  - Could also be translated in four ways: See! Look! Behold! Lo!
    * **an evil spirit of weakness**  - That is, "an evil spirit that made her weak". As some previous spirits made the people they possessed mute or wild, this one made its victim weak and left her physically unable to stand up straight.
