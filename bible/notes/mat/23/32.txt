===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to rebuke religious leaders

  * **You, also **- This "you" refers to the scribes and Pharisees.
  * **you fill up the measure - **  This phase is used to give the idea of a cup, partly filled by fathers, completely filled by the sons. This could be translated "you finished committing" (UDB) your father's sins.
  * **you offspring of vipers**  - This is a metaphor that is comparing the scribes and Pharisees to a dangerous and poisonous snake. (See: Metaphor)
