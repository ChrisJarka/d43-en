====== General notes about Matthew 10 ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The sending of the 12 disciples ==

A large section of this chapter discusses Jesus' sending of the 12 disciples to share his message about the kingdom. They were to limit their ministry to Israel and not share this news with the Gentiles. Jesus' instructions gives the reader the impression that they are not to waste any time. There is a sense of urgency in the tone.


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== The 12 disciples ===
The following are the list of the twelve disciples:
In Matthew: 
Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.

In Mark:
Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, 

In Luke:
Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James, the son of Alphaeus, Simon, who was called the Zealot, Judas, the son of James, and Judas Iscariot,

It is probable that Thaddaeus and Jude, the son of James, are two names of the same person. 

== Is Near ==

This phrase can have great theological significance. Scholars often debate whether the "kingdom of heaven" was present at this time or still coming. English translations frequently use the phrase "at hand" but this can create difficulty in translating its meaning properly. Other translations use the phase "is drawing near" and "has come near." In Greek, the word is defined as "to move closer."
