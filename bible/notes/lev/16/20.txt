\v 20 And when he has made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat:
\v 21 and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a man that is in readiness into the wilderness:
\v 22 and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities to a solitary land: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
