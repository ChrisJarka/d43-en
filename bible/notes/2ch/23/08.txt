\v 8 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men,
those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not
the courses.
\v 9 And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king
Davidâ€™s, which were in the house of God.
