==== Description ====


Symbolic prophecy is a type of message that God gave to a prophet so that the prophet would tell others. These messages use images and symbols to show what God will do in the future.

The main books that have these prophecies are Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah, and Revelation.

The Bible tells both how God gave each message and what the message was. When God gave the messages, he often did so in miraculous ways such as in dreams and visions. (See: [[en:obe:other:dream]] and [[en:obe:other:vision]].) When prophets saw these dreams and visions, they often saw things about God and heaven that people ordinarily do not see. Some of these things  are also shown in images and symbols, and some of the prophets saw things very similar to what other prophets saw.

There are certain ideas that are repeated in the various symbolic prophecies throughout the Bible. They tell about the evil in this world and how God will judge the world and punish sin. They tell about a great battle and how God will establish his righteous kingdom on the new world he is creating. Besides telling about the world, they tell about things in heaven and in hell.

The symbols and images used in some prophecies are also used in others. For example, in some of the prophecies oil and fire represent the Holy Spirit, white hair represents wisdom, strong animals represent kingdoms, horns represent kings or kingdoms, a dragon or serpent represents the devil, the sea represents the nations, weeks represent longer periods of time.

Other images and ideas that are used in multiple prophecies are 


Some of these writings are presented as poetry and some are presented as narrative. They usually use the past tense because the prophet tells about what he saw in the vision or dream. But they are about things that will happen in the future. (See: 

Symbolic prophecies show what God will do in the future. Some of them have already happened, and some will happen at the end of this world. Though they are about things in the future


Reason this is a translation issue:

=== Translation Principles === 
  * Translate the images in the text. Do not try to interpret them and translate their meaning.
    * Some images may be about miraculous events,
    * Other images may be symbols of other things.

Predictive Prophecy

Writings about the end of this world are different than many other writings in Scripture. They contrast this present evil age with the coming age. There is encouragement that God will finally bring perfect justice to this world and he will bring victory in the greatest battle the world has seen. Together the writings about the end of this world form one story, across several books, about God’s complete control over the events of the world. 

Writings about the end of this world can come in many different forms. They are a special type of prophecy which can take the form of narrative or poetry. Usually they contain unusual, otherworldly events which have been divinely revealed in a supernatural way. 

Writings of this type contain lots of symbolism which is often rooted in the Old Testament and previous revelation. This may create difficulties if the complete Old Testament has not been translated. Because these writings form their own story alongside the normal narrative of Scripture, they share a great deal of common terminology and images. If possible, the translator should try to correspond the terms used in this style in one book with the terms used in this writing style in a different book. If the translator does not have have access to other adequately translated book (like Daniel), they may wish to consult  another  translation. 

Much of the uniqueness of this style involves the use of paradox. A paradox is a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement. While the tone of writing about the end of this world speaks about condemnation, it is implicitly intended to product hope for the faithful. This implies that it is the faithful who are the subject of these writings even though they more often address the unbeliever. While it is desired that the unbeliever comes to repentance, it is assumed that number of those who repent will be exceedingly small. These writings are also distinct from prophecy because they are not meant to be easily understood. Instead, they are to remain mysterious and require discernment from the spiritually mature believer. 

They often have concepts or terms that are supposed to function as “polar” opposites. 

It mysterious nature is not supposed to be understood and the translator will need to leave many aspects of the book appear confusing. This is especially true when the events themselves appear otherworldly or impossible. 


Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah and Revelation should really be translated together or be studied together to correlate well with one another
symbols function to encourage believers that justice will eventually come and to draw unbelievers to repentance.
