\v 9 After they heard what he said, those who were questioning him started walking away, one by one, the older ones first and then the younger ones. They knew they were all sinners. Finally only Jesus was there, with the woman.
\v 10 Jesus stood up and asked her, "Woman, where are those who accuse you? Has no one brought a charge against you, that you must be punished?"
\v 11 She said, "No, sir, no one." Then Jesus said, "I do not condemn you either. Go home now, and from now on, do not sin like this any more!"

\v 9 And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest,
even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.
\v 10 And Jesus lifted up himself, and said to her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?
\v 11 And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go your way; from henceforth sin no more.]
