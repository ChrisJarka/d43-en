===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **hide in the dust**  - "hide in the holes in the ground"
  * **Yahweh - **  This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the Important Term page concerning how to translate this.
  * **The lofty gaze of man will be brought low, and the pride of men will be brought down, **- This is saying the same thing twice in two different ways to emphasize that God will cause people to no longer be proud. Also, “will be brought low” is a passive clause. This could be translated as an active clause: “He will cause people to no longer be arrogant.” (UDB) (See: Doublet and Active)
  * **on that Day**  - This is a metonym that refers to when Yahweh will judge all people. This can be translated as “on the day that he comes to judge everyone.” (See: Metonymy)
