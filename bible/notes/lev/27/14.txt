\v 14 \add Similarly\add*, if someone dedicates his house to be a sacred gift to belong to me, the priest will decide how much it is worth, which will depend on whether the house is in good condition. Whatever the priest says that it is worth, that will be its value \add and that is the price that the priest must pay for it\add*.
\v 15 If the man who dedicated his house to me later wants to buy it back, he must pay that price plus an added one-fifth, and then the house will belong to him again.

\v 14 When a man desires to dedicate his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest will estimate the value, whether it is good or bad. As the priest estimates the value, so will it stand.
\v 15 If he who dedicated his house wants to redeem it, then he must add a fifth to the value of its estimation, and then the house will be his again.
