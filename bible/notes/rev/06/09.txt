\v 9 Then the lamb opened the fifth seal, and I saw under the altar in heaven the souls of God's servants whom others had killed because these servants had believed God's message and because they had told others the message about Jesus.
\v 10 They said loudly to God, "Sovereign Lord, you are holy and true. How long will it be before you judge and punish the people on earth who murdered us?"
\v 11 Then God gave to each of them a long, white robe, and he told them to rest and be patient a little longer. They should be patient until the wicked people killed all the believers who served the Lord with them. These believers were those whom God wanted to die in just the same way that these others had died.

\v 9 When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and for the testimony which they held.
\v 10 They cried out with a great voice, saying, "How long, Lord, the holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them who dwell on the earth?"
\v 11 A white robe was given to each one of them. It was said to them, that they should enjoy rest yet for a little time until their fellow servants and their brothers should also be completed, who were about be killed even as they were.
