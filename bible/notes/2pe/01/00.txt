====== 2 Peter 01 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Knowing God ==
Christian spiritual growth is often described as knowing God more or knowing God better. This is because a growing Christian understands the things of God better as they grow.

== Forgetting what God has done ==
Peter believes Christians, who are not leading [[:en:obe:kt:godly|godly]] lives, have forgotten the cost of their [[:en:obe:kt:save|salvation]]. He reasons: if they remembered their former life and what Jesus has done, they would be sufficiently motivated to live [[:en:obe:kt:godly|godly]] lives.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Divine revelation ==
Peter describes Christianity as a religion, which has been [[:en:obe:kt:reveal|revealed]] and proved by God and it is therefore implied that it is not a creation of man, like all other religions (except Judaism). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
