\c 68
\d For the Chief Musician; A Psalm of David, a song.
\q
\v 1 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered;
\q Let them also that hate him flee before him.
\q
\v 2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away:
\q As wax melteth before the fire,
\q So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
\q
\v 3 But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God:
\q Yea, let them rejoice with gladness.
\q
\v 4 Sing to God, sing praises to his name:
\q Cast up a highway for him that rideth through the deserts;
\q His name is Jehovah; and exult you before him.
\q
\v 5 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows,
\q Is God in his holy habitation.
\q
\v 6 God sets the solitary in families:
\q He brings out the prisoners into prosperity;
\q But the rebellious dwell in a parched land.
\b
\q
\v 7 O God, when you went forth before your people,
\q When you did march through the wilderness; \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 8 The earth trembled,
\q The heavens also dropped rain at the presence of God:
\q Yon Sinai trembled at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
\q
\v 9 Thou, O God, did send a plentiful rain,
\q You did confirm your inheritance, when it was weary.
\q
\v 10 Your congregation lived therein:
\q Thou, O God, did prepare of your goodness for the poor.
\q
\v 11 The Lord gives the word:
\q The women that publish the tidings are a great host.
\q
\v 12 Kings of armies flee, they flee;
\q And she that waits at home divideth the spoil.
\q
\v 13 When you lie among the sheepfolds,
\q It is as the wings of a dove covered with silver,
\q And her pinions with yellow gold.
\q
\v 14 When the Almighty scattered kings therein,
\q It was as when it snoweth in Zalmon.
\q
\v 15 A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan;
\q A high mountain is the mountain of Bashan.
\q
\v 16 Why look you askance, you high mountains,
\q At the mountain which God has desired for his abode?
\q Yea, Jehovah will dwell in it for ever.
\q
\v 17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands:
\q The Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary.
\q
\v 18 You have ascended on high, you have led away captives;
\q You have received gifts among men,
\q Yea, among the rebellious also, that Jehovah God might dwell
with them.
\b
\q
\v 19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burden,
\q Even the God who is our salvation. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 20 God is to us a God of deliverances;
\q And to Jehovah the Lord belongs escape from death.
\q
\v 21 But God will strike through the head of his enemies,
\q The hairy scalp of such a one as goes on still in his guiltiness.
\q
\v 22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan,
\q I will bring them again from the depths of the sea;
\q
\v 23 That you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood,
\q That the tongue of your dogs may have its portion from your
enemies.
\q
\v 24 They have seen your goings, O God,
\q Even the goings of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
\q
\v 25 The singers went before, the minstrels followed after,
\q In the midst of the damsels playing with timbrels.
\q
\v 26 Bless you God in the congregations,
\q Even the Lord, you that are of the fountain of Israel.
\q
\v 27 There is little Benjamin their ruler,
\q The princes of Judah and their council,
\q The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
\b
\q
\v 28 Your God has commanded your strength:
\q Strengthen, O God, that which you have wrought for us.
\q
\v 29 Because of your temple at Jerusalem
\q Kings shall bring presents to thee.
\q
\v 30 Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds,
\q The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples,
\q Trampling under foot the pieces of silver:
\q He has scattered the peoples that delight in war.
\q
\v 31 Princes shall come out of Egypt;
\q Ethiopia shall haste to stretch out her hands to God.
\q
\v 32 Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth;
\q Oh sing praises to the Lord; \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 33 To him that rideth upon the heaven of heavens, which are of old;
\q Lo, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.
\q
\v 34 Ascribe you strength to God:
\q His excellency is over Israel,
\q And his strength is in the skies.
\q
\v 35 O God, you are terrible out of your holy places:
\q The God of Israel, he gives strength and power to his people.
\q Blessed be God.
