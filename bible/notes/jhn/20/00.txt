====== John 20 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Receive the Holy Spirit" ==
The disciples had special power from the Holy Spirit given to them. This empowered their ministry.

== "My Lord and my God" ==
This can also be translated as "the lord of me and the God of me." Jesus is the one true God.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Rabboni ==
This is a phrase in Hebrew. Mark does not "translate" this phrase into Greek but chooses to "transliterate" or transfer it into Greek using Greek letters instead of Hebrew letters. The translators of the ULB and UDB have not translated this phrase either. The translator should try to form the sounds of this phrase without translating its meaning.

== Jesus' resurrection body ==
There is some mystery about Jesus' body at this point. He was physically present with the scars from the crucifixion but he could also enter into rooms without having to use a door. It is best to leave the mystery in place but explanation may be necessary if the translation does not make sense to the reader.

== Two Angels ==
=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter===

== A young man ==
The gospel accounts differ as to how many men or angels appeared in this interaction. It is probably that the men were angels, but their number is unclear. It is best to translate this as it appears in the ULB without trying to reconcile these passages. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:mat:28:01|Matthew 28:1-2]], [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:16:05|Mark 16:5]] and [[:en:bible:notes:luk:24:04|Luke 24:4]]).
