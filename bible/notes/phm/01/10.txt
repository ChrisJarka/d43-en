\v 10 I request that you do something for Onesimus. He is now like a son of mine because I told him about Christ here in prison.
\v 11 Although his name, as you know, means "useful," he was useless to you in the past. But now he is useful both to you and to me!
\p
\v 12 Although he is very dear to me, I am sending him back to you.
\v 13 I would like to have kept him with me, in order that he might serve me in your place. I need him because I am in prison because of my preaching the message about Christ.

<usfm>
\v 10 I am asking you concerning my child Onesimus,  whom I have fathered in my chains.
\v 11 For he once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable both to you and to me.
\v 12 I have sent him—he who is my very heart—back to you.
\v 13 I wish I could have kept him with me, so he could serve me in your place, while I am in chains for the sake of the gospel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **my child Onesimus** - "my son Onesimus." Paul compared his close relationship with Onesimus to the relationship that a father and his son have. Onesimus was not Paul's actual son, but he received spiritual life when Paul taught him about Jesus, and Paul loved him. AT: "my spiritual son Onesimus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Onesimus** - This is the name of a man who was apparently the slave of Philemon who had stolen something and run away. The name "Onesimus" means "profitable" or "useful." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **whom I have fathered** - How Onesimus became like a son to Paul can be made explicit: "who became my spiritual son when I taught him about Christ and he received new life." AT: "who became a son to me" or "who became like a son to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in my chains** - Prisoners were often bound in chains. Paul was in prison when he taught Onesimus and was still in prison when he wrote this letter. AT: "while I was in prison" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **For he once was unprofitable** - "Before, he was useless"
  * **but now is profitable** - "but now he is is useful" 
  * **I have sent him—he who is my very heart—back to you** - Paul was probably sending Onesimus with another believer and this letter.
  * **who is my very heart** - Here the word "heart" is used for someone who is dearly loved. Paul was saying this about Onesimus. AT: "whom I love dearly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **so he could serve me in your place** - "that, since you cannot be here, he might help me" or "so that he could help me in your place"
  * **I am in chains** - "while I am in prison" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for the sake of the gospel** - "because I preach the gospel."
