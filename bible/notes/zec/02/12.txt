===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh will inherit Judah as his rightful possession** - Zechariah speaks of Yahweh claiming Judah as his own land as if Judah were something that Yahweh inherits as a permanent possession. AT: "Yahweh will claim Judah as his rightful possession" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all flesh** - Here the word "flesh" represents all humanity. AT: "all people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **he has been roused** - Zechariah speaks of Yahweh beginning to act as if someone had roused Yahweh from inactivity. It is implied that this action refers to his returning to Jerusalem. AT: "for he is coming" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **from out of his holy place** - Here "his holy place" refers to heaven, and not to the temple in Jerusalem. AT: "from his holy place in heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
