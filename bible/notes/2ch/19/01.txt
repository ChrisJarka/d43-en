===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Hanani, the seer** - "Hanani" is the name of a man. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:16:07|16:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **went out to meet him** - Here the word "him" refers to Jehoshaphat.
  * **Should you be helping the wicked? Should you be loving those who hate Yahweh?** - These questions expect negative answers to make the point that Jehoshaphat should not have helped Ahab. AT: "You should not help the wicked! You should not love those who hate Yahweh!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the wicked** - This refers to wicked people in general. AT: "wicked people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
  * **anger from Yahweh is on you** - The abstract noun "anger" can be translated using the word "angry." This phrase can be expressed in active form. AT: "Yahweh is angry with you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **there is some good to be found in you** - The abstract noun "good" can be translated as an adjective. This phrase can be expressed in active form. AT: "you have done some good things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

  * **Asherah poles** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:14:01|14:3]].
  * **fixed your heart** - Here the heart represents the will. Jehoshaphat's will is spoken of as being fixed or immovable, which means having an unchanging intention to seek God. AT: "firmly decided" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **seek God** - Wanting to do what pleases God is spoken of as if Jehoshaphat were seeking him. AT: "do what pleases God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
