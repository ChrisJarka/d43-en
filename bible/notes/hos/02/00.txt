====== Hosea 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is written in poetry and uses special devices (like chiasm) to highlight certain important parts. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Chiasm ==

This chapter includes a special device called chiasm to highlight Gomer as a prostitute and her children as children of prostitution in verse 2-3. 

== Personification ==

When Hosea took a prostitute, Gomer, as a wife, this demonstrated how Yahweh was rejected by His covenant people Israel.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

Chapter 1 through 4 of Hosea is controlled by a metaphor that Hosea lived out! He was personifying the relationship between Israel and Yahweh. Hosea played the part of Yahweh and Gomer played the part of Israel.

Many relationships are used in this chapter that are metaphors for the relationship between Israel and her God (i.e. brother, sister, husband, wife, mother and children). 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

This chapter break creates an abrupt change of address.The prophet is now addressing the children directly in the first few verses but the whole chapter is written against Gomer as a type for Israel as an adulteress people. In some fashion, God has set Gomer up as a type to show the people of Israel how they are not to treat Him as their God.
