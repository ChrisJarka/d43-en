<usfm>
\v 17 The reason my Father loves me is that I will sacrifice my life. I will give up my life, and I will take it up to live again.
\v 18 No one is causing me to lay down my life. I have chosen to sacrifice myself. I have authority to lay down my life and I have authority to take it up and to live again. This work is from my Father, and he has commanded me to do it."

<usfm>
\v 17 This is why the Father loves me: I lay down my life that I may take it again.
\v 18 No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. I have received this command from my Father."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues talking to the crowd.

  * **love** - This is kind of love that comes from God that is focused on the good of others, even when it doesn't benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. 
  * **This is why the Father loves me: I lay down my life** - The eternal plan of God was for God the Son to give his life to pay for the sins of humanity. Jesus' death on the cross reveals the intense love of the Son for the Father and the Father for the Son, and their love for everyone who turns to Jesus and believes in him.
  * **I lay down my life that I may take it again** - This is a mild way for Jesus to say he will die and then bring himself back to life. Alternate translation: "I allow myself to die in order that I may bring myself back to life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
