====== Original Manuscripts ======

The Bible was written many hundreds of years ago as God inspired his prophets and apostles in ancient times. The Old Testament books were written in Hebrew, and a few parts in Aramaic, the language that the people of Israel used as they lived in exile in Assyria and Babylon. The Old Testament was later translated into Greek about two to three hundred years before Christ. The New Testament books were written in koine (or “common”) Greek, the language that was used for wider communication throughout the known world between 300 years before Christ and 300 years after Christ.

Since there was no paper in those early days, these writings were put on specially prepared animal skins or a material woven of reeds. These writings were extremely important, so they copied them over and over, but with great care to be accurate and faithful to the original text as much as they could determine what that was.

Through the years there were many copies that were spread out over the world. As the //texts// were translated into ancient languages such as Latin, the translators depended on the //manuscripts// they had in various parts of the world. Later, people began to collect these copies and compare them. While these copies were very much the same, some of them had small differences from each other.

To decide which copies were right, people decided that the oldest copies were closer to the originals, and the more recent copies were thought to have more errors of either copying or errors of ideas introduced into them by the people making the copies. So, when we try to decide which copies are more reliable or trustworthy, we prefer the older ones and also we prefer //families of texts// that had a reputation for accuracy.

Some people tried to introduce ideas into the text, some with good intentions, some not. Over all, the Bible books have been copied with great accuracy and faithfulness.

==== Missing Verses ====

When we put a footnote explaining that “some ancient authorities add a verse here,” e.g.,the longer ending of Mark's Gospel, verses such as Acts 8:37, or 1 John 5:7-8, the Bible student needs to be careful to look at the history of the added words to determine whether they are likely to be from the original text. This requires a great deal of study and many resources that we cannot provide through Door43.org.
