    * **the way** - That is, "the path" or "the road."
    * **Prepare....make straight-** Prepare is a one time command whereas make straight is something which is to continually be done. Might be understood as "Make the decision to follow God...Continuously make a clear path for His will in your life."
    * **Make ready the way of the Lord**  - That is, "Make the road ready for the Lord to come along it." It is a metaphor meaning, "Repent and be ready for when the Lord comes." This metaphor continues through verse 5 to show how important it is to be ready when the Lord comes.  (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]]).
    * **Make his paths straight** - This could also be translated as "Continue to make his paths straight." This to is a metaphor meaning "Be ready for the Lord."
