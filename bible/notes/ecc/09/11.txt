====== Ecclesiastes 09:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 I have seen something else here on the earth:
\q1 The person who runs fastest does not always win the race,
\q1 the strongest soldiers do not always win the battle,
\q1 the wisest people do not always have food,
\q1 the smartest people do not always become rich,
\q1 and the people who have studied a lot are not always honored\f + \ft Or: treated very specially \f* by others;
\q1 we cannot always control what things will happen to us and where they will happen.
\p
\v 12 No one knows when he will die \f + \ft euphemism \f*;
\q1 fish are cruelly caught in a net,
\q2 and birds are caught in snares\f + \ft Or: traps \f*;
\q1 similarly \f + \ft simile \f*, people experience disasters
\q2 at times when they do not expect them to happen.

\v 11 I returned, and saw under the sun, 
that the race is not to the swift, 
and  the battle is not to the strong, 
and also bread is not to the wise, 
and also riches is not to men of understanding, 
and also favor is not to men of skill; 
but time and chance happens to them all.
\v 12 For man also does not know his time: just like the fish that are taken in an evil net, or just like the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them.
