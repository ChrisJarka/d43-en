==== Patterns in Biblical imagery ====

=== Part One: Patterned metaphors and similes ===

As in languages everywhere, most metaphors and similes in Biblical Hebrew and Greek fall into broad patterns that are unique to those languages. It is very useful to recognize these patterns, because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere.

These metaphorical patterns present three challenges to anyone who wants to identify them:

(1) The surface manifestations of the Biblical metaphors usually obscure their underlying structures. For example, it may not be immediately obvious that the expression //It is God who puts strength on me like a belt.// Pss. 18:32 (ULB) is authorized by the pattern CLOTHING IS MORAL QUALITY (see no. 4 below).

(2) As with all language, the context, i.e., the "co-text," must determine the sense of an expression. Thus, for example, whether "lamp" refers concretely to a container with oil and a wick for giving light, or whether it refers to the notion of life (see LAMP OR FIRE IS LIFE, no. 2 below), depends on the context.

(3) Expressions that are authorized by these metaphorical patterns frequently combine together in complex ways. Moreover, they frequently combine with—and in some cases are based on—**cultural models ** (see Part Three below).

What follows is a list of some of the frequent underlying structural metaphors in the Old Testament, together with examples of their actual textual manifestations.
