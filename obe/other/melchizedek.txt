====== Melchizedek ======
â€‹

===== Facts: =====

During the time when Abram lived, Melchizedek was the king of Salem (later called "Jerusalem").

  * Melchizedek's name means, "king of righteousness" and his title "king of Salem" means "king of peace."
  * He was also called a "priest of God Most High."
  * Melchizedek is first mentioned in the Bible when he served Abram bread and wine after Abram rescued his nephew Lot from some powerful kings.
  * Then Abram gave Melchizedek one-tenth of the plunder from his victory.
  * In the New Testament, Melchizedek is described as someone who had no father or mother. He was a priest and king who will reign forever. He is said to "resemble the Son of God."
  * Also in the New Testament, Jesus is called a priest who serves according to the priestly "order of Melchizedek." This was different from the Jewish priests who were from the order of Levi. Jesus is our "Great High Priest" whose priesthood comes directly from God, not from human descent.
  * Based on these statements in the Bible, some people have thought that Melchizedek may have been the Son of God making an appearance in Old Testament times, long before he came to earth as Jesus. 
  * Melchizedek may also have been a prophetic reference to Jesus, looking forward to the coming of the eternal King of Peace and Righteousness.
