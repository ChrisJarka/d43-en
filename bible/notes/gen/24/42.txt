\v 42 When I came today to the well, I prayed, 'Yahweh God whom my master, Abraham worships, if you are willing, please allow this journey of mine to be successful.
\v 43 Listen to me. I am standing alongside a well. A girl may come to draw water. I am asking you that if I say to her, "Please, give me a little water to drink from your jar."
\v 44 If she says to me, "Certainly, drink some, and I will also draw some water for your camels," that will be the woman whom you have chosen for my master's son!'

\v 42 So I arrived today at the spring, and said, 'O Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, if you will truly prosper the path that I am taking,
\v 43 then see me standing by the spring of water. Please let the young woman who comes out to draw water, to whom I say, "Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,"
\v 44 and who says to me, "Drink,  and I will also draw water for your camels," let her be the woman whom Yahweh has chosen for my master’s son."'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Abraham's servant continues speaking to Rebekah's family.

  * **spring**  - "the well"
  * **if you will truly prosper the path that I am taking** - Alternate translation: “if this is truly what you want, please make my journey successful.”
  * **then see me standing**  - Here the phrase "then see me" adds emphasis to what follows. You could translate it as "Look, I am standing."
  * **to draw water** - "to get water" 
  * **pitcher**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:24:15|24:15]].
  * **whom Yahweh as chosen** - Since the servant was praying to Yahweh, this can also be translated as "whom you have chosen."
