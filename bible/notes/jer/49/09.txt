\q
\v 9 If grape harvesters came to you, would they not leave a little bit behind?
\q If thieves came in the night, would they not steal only as much as they wanted?
\q
\v 10 But I have stripped Esau bare. I have revealed his hiding places.
\q So he will not be able to hide himself. His children, his brothers, and his neighbors are destroyed, and he is gone.

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking about what will happen to Edom.

  * **If grape harvesters ... would they not leave a little bit behind?** - Yahweh uses a question to cause the people to think about how grape harvesters leave some grapes behind. AT: "If grape harvester ... they would certainly leave some grapes behind." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If thieves ... would they not steal only as much as they wanted?** - Yahweh uses a question to cause the people to think about how thieves only take what they want. AT: "If thieves ... they would only take as much as they wanted." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **But I have stripped Esau bare** - Yahweh causing an enemy army to come and take everything is spoken of as if Yahweh stripped all the clothes off of Esau. AT: "But I have sent an army to take everything away from Esau" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Esau ... his hiding ... he will not ... hide himself ... His children ... he is gone** - Here "Esau" represents the people of Edom.
