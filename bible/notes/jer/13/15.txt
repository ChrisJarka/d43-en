\p
\v 15 Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud; for Jehovah has spoken.
\v 16 Give glory to Jehovah your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and,
while you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.
\v 17 But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for
your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because Jehovahâ€™s flock is taken captive.
