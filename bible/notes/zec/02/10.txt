===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Ho**  - This term is an interjection/exclamation used by prophets. “Ho” is the pronunciation in the original Hebrew. This word indicates strong emotion and warning. It could mean “ah”, “alas”, or “woe”, but in this case is probably used to draw attention to what is being said.
  * **daughter of Zion**  - This refers to the people of Jerusalem and all of Judah.
  * **I/myself/He/my**  - These pronouns refer to Yahweh.
  * **I myself am about to come and encamp among you!"**  - "I am going to come and live with you! (or "among you!")"
  * **encamp**  - "set up and use a camp."
  * **you**  - People of Jerusalem.
  * **join**  - This word means to make a union with.
  * **themselves**  - This pronoun refers to the nations.
  * **in that day**  - This refers to the day in which these events occur. Zechariah's prophecy may begin to be fulfilled in his own time, but ultimately will be fulfilled by the Messiah. "In that day" often refers to end times. Prophecy can also refer to multiple periods of time.
  * **midst**  - "in the middle."
  * **me**  - refers to the Messiah (Jesus) and/or to Zechariah.  See how the pronouns are explained in 2:6-8.
