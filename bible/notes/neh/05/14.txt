<usfm> \p \v 14 So from the time I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food provided for the governor. \v 15 But the former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens on the people, and took from them forty shekels of silver for their daily food and wine. Even their servants oppressed the people. But I did not do so because of the fear of God. </usfm>

  * **twelve years**
 - Nehemiah is restating the number of years for emphasis.

 - This food was provided by the king and was part of what a governer was paid by the people. Because the people were starving, Nehemiah chose not to make use of this privilege.
