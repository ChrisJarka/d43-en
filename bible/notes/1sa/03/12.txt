\v 12 In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.
\v 13 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a
curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.
\v 14 And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eliâ€™s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice
nor offering for ever.
