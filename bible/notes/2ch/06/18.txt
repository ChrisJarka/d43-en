\v 18 But, my God, will you really live on earth among people \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? There is surely not enough \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* space for you in the sky, or even in the heaven! So there is surely not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* enough space for you to live in this temple that my workers have built.
\v 19 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to my prayer, while I am pleading with this day and do what I am requesting.
\v 20 Please be protecting \f + \ft metonymy \f* this temple day and night. This is the place about which you have said, 'I \f + \ft metonymy \f* will always be there \f + \ft metonymy \f*.' Please listen to my prayer about this place.

\v 18 But, my God, will you really live on earth among us? This temple I have built cannot contain you; not even the universe and heaven itself can contain you.
\v 19 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to my prayer, while I am pleading with this day and do what I am requesting.
\v 20 Always protect this temple, this place where you said you would be present, in order that you might always hear me when I pray, for I am your servant.

\v 18 But will God actually live with mankind on the earth? Look, the entire universe and heaven itself cannot contain you—how much less can this temple that I have built!
\v 19 Yet please respect this prayer of your servant and his request, Yahweh my God; listen to the cry and prayer that your servant prays before you.
\v 20 May your eyes be open toward this temple day and night, the place where you promised to put your name. May you listen to the prayer your servant prays toward this place.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But will God actually live with mankind on the earth?** - Possible meanings of this question are 1) Solomon is asking a real question and expecting an answer or 2) the question is rhetorical and Solomon is emphasizing that God is too big and mighty to live on earth. AT: "But it surely cannot be that God will actually live on the earth!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **But will God** - Here Solomon speaks about God in the third person to show his great respect for God. It can be stated in the second person. AT: "But will you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Look** - "What I am about to say is important" or "The truth is that"
  * **the entire universe and heaven itself cannot contain you** - This implies that God is much greater than all the universe and heaven. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:02:06|2:6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **you—how much less can this temple that I have built** - "you, so this temple that I have built certainly cannot contain you"
  * **respect this prayer of your servant and his request** - The words "prayer" and "request" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that he is sincere as he makes his request. Solomon refers to himself as "your servant" to show that he respects Yahweh. This can be stated in first person. AT: "respect me, your servant, as I make this request" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]]) 
  * **listen to the cry and prayer that your servant prays before you today** - The words "cry" and "prayer" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that he is sincere as he asks Yahweh to help him. Solomon refers to himself as "your servant" to show that he respects Yahweh. This can be stated in first person. AT: "listen to me, your servant, as I call today for you to help me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **May your eyes be open toward this temple** - The eyes being open is a metonym for watching, and here watching represents protecting. "Please watch over this temple" or "Please protect this temple" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **day and night** - This is a merism. AT: "all the time" or "continually" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **where you promised to put your name** -  Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh's name represents himself. AT: "where you promised to be" or 2) Yahweh's name represents his reputation. AT: "where you promised to make people know you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the prayer your servant prays toward this place** - Solomon refers to himself as "your servant" to show that he respects Yahweh. AT: "the prayer that I, your servant, pray toward this place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
