\v 16 So some of the Pharisees said, "Since this man \add Jesus\add* disobeys \add our rules about working\add* on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f*, he is not from God." But others said, "If he was a sinner, he could certainly not do such miracles!\f + \ft Or: how could he do such miracles? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" So they were divided.
\v 17 So one of them said to the blind man again, "You are the man whom he enabled to see. What do you yourself say about him?" The man said, "\add I think\add* he is a prophet!" \add So they told him to go\add*.
\p
\v 18 The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* still did not believe that the man was blind when he was born, and that he was \add now\add* able to see. So they sent someone to bring the man's parents.

\v 16 Some of the Pharisees said, "We know this man Jesus is not from God because he doesn't honor the Sabbath day.” But others from that group said, “If he was a sinner, how could he do such works of power that everyone sees!" So there was a division among the Pharisees.
\v 17 So they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, since he is the one who restored your sight?" The man said at the end of the questioning, "He is a prophet." 
\p
\v 18 The Jews who were opposed to Jesus did not believe the man had been blind and that now he was able to see. So they sent someone to bring in the man's parents so they could be questioned.

can a man that is a sinner do such signs?" And there was a division among them.
\v 17 So  they  asked   the blind man again, "What do you say about  him, because he opened your eyes?" And he said, "He is a
prophet."
\v 18 Now the Jews still  did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called
the parents of him that had received his sight,
