====== How to Translate Unknowns ======

  - Use a descriptive phrase.  You will most likely need to use a phrase to explain the meaning of the unknown word.  It is important only to describe the part of the meaning which is being used in the particular verse being translated.
  - Substitute something similar.  At times the exact word may be unknown to the people of the Receptor Language but there might be something similar that could be used in its place.
  - Use a foreign word from another language.  Foreign words are words taken from another language not usually spoken by people of the language being translated.  Use the foreign word in conjunction with a general word or descriptive phrase.
  - Use a word that is more general in meaning.  An example would be the word "building" is more general than the word "house" because a house is a kind of building.
  - Use a word or phrase that is more specific in meaning.  Sometimes there is no word in the Receptor Language to describe the term therefore you can give specific examples of the term being referred to.  An example would be if there is no word for "lights" you could possibly say "the sun and the moon" using specific words.

==== Animals ====

Descriptive phrase - Remember to describe the part of the meaning that is important to the verse being translated.  For example in John 10:12 the word "Wolf" is used meaning a fierce wild animal.  There are many things to describe a "wolf" but what is important in this verse is a fierce animal that frightened not only the sheep but the person looking after them too.

Substitute something similar - Wolves are similar to large wild dogs. They attack and eat other animals, such as lambs. “Wolves” can be translated as with a generic term like “wild dogs” or “fierce dogs” or with the name of a specific animal like a dog that your people know of, such as “coyotes” or “jackals”

==== Cultural ====

Word more general in meaning - In certain cultures when men greeted other men who where family or friends, they would kiss them on one cheek or both cheeks. This can be translated as “to greet him with a kiss” or “to greet him by kissing him.”  If your readers would find it embarrassing to say that a man would kiss another man, you could translate it in a more general way: “to give him a friendly greeting.”

===== Translation Suggestions Needs Editing =====

There are many things to keep in mind when translating a name.

  * Proper names sometimes reveal information about the person, place, or thing it refers to.
  * Proper names of people may reveal something about the origin or history of the family.
  * Proper names of people may reveal something about a characteristic of the person.
  * Sometimes proper names of people and proper names of places have more than one name.

There are several ways to handle names when translating the Bible:

  * Copy the proper name from the source language into the target language with no change of the spelling, symbols, or sound.
  * Pronounce the name as it is pronounced in the source language, and using the target language's spelling system. Write the new proper name in a way that people will read it with the source language's pronunciation.
  * Spell the name as it is spelled in the source language, but pronounce the word according to how the target language pronounces those symbols.​
  * Translate the meaning of the name.
  * If a person or place has two names, use the name that occurs in the particular text you are translating.
  * If a person or place has two names, use one name most of the time and the other name only when the text talks about the name or its meaning.
