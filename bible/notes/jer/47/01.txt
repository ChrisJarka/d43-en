===== translationNotes: =====

  * **This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah** - The idiom "the word of Yahweh that came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:14:01|14:1]], and make any changes as needed. AT: "This is the message that Yahweh gave to Jeremiah" or "This is the message that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **This word came to him** - The idiom "this word came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. AT: "Yahweh gave this message to Jeremiah" or "Yahweh spoke this message to Jeremiah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **before Pharaoh** - Here "Pharaoh" represents the Egyptians army. AT: "before Pharaoh's army" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **See** - The word "see" alerts us to pay attention to what is about to be said.
  * **floods of water are rising in the north. They will be like an overflowing river!** - The two phrases have a similar meaning. The enemy army is spoken of as if it were a flood. AT: "an army in the north will come like a flood. They will be powerful like an overflowing river" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they will overflow the land** - This continues speaking of the army from the north as an overflowing river. AT: "like an overflowing river, the army from the north will destroy the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
