\v 8 Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, the God of the Israelites, says this:
\q1 "I have heard the people of Moab and Ammon
\q1 insult my people and plan to conquer my people's country.
\q1
\v 9 So now, as surely as I live, I will destroy Moab and Ammon
\q2 as I destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
\q1 Their land will be a place where there are nettles and salt pits;
\q2 it will be ruined forever, with none of their people living there!
\q1 My people who survive will take away all their valuable possessions
\q2 and also occupy their land."

\q
\v 8 "I have heard the taunts of Moab and the reviling of the people of Ammon
\q when they taunted my people and violated their borders.
\q
\v 9 Therefore, as I live—this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel—
\q Moab will become like Sodom, and the people of Ammon like Gomorrah;
\q a place of nettles and a salt pit, deserted forever.
\q But the remnant of my people will plunder them, and the remainder of my nation will take possession of them."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In 2:4-15, Yahweh announces his judgment on the nations that surround Judah. 

  * **the taunts ... the reviling** - "the taunts ... the insults." These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that both Moab and Ammon have insulted Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **violated their borders** - This refers to crossing over into Judah's territory in order to attack them.
  * **as I live** - "as surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. AT: "this is what Yahweh of hosts has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh of hosts, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **like Sodom ... like Gomorrah** - These two cities were so wicked that God completely destroyed them with fire from heaven. These similes therefore refer to complete destruction. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "completely destroyed like Sodom ... like Gomorrah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **a place of nettles and a salt pit** - "a place with thorns and a salt pit." This describes a barren, useless land. 
  * **the remnant of my people ... the remainder of my nation** - These two phrases mean the same thing and refer to the Israelites that survived Yahweh's punishment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
