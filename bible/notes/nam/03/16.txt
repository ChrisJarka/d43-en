<usfm>
\v 16 You have multiplied your merchants above the stars of heaven: the canker-worm ravageth, and fleeth away.
\v 17 Your princes are as the locusts, and your marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which encamp in the hedges in the cold
day, but when the sun arises they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.
