<usfm> \v 7 So I spoke to the bones what Yahweh commanded me to speak. As I was speaking, there was a noise, a rumbling sound like the earth makes in an earthquake, and the bones came together, bones joining to each other. \v 8 While I was looking, I saw tendons fastening to them and flesh covering them, and then skin covered the flesh, but they did not breathe.
