\v 17 Concerning the matters \add about which I will instruct you now\add*, I do not praise you, because whenever you believers meet together, good \add things do not happen\add*. Instead, bad things \add happen\add*.
\v 18 First of all, people have told me that when you gather together as a group \add to worship God\add*, you divide into groups \add that are hostile to each other\add*. To some extent I believe that is true.
\v 19 It seems that you must divide into \add groups that despise each other\add* in order that it might be clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* which people among you \add God\add* approves of!

\v 17 But in giving you this charge, I do not praise you because you do not come together for the better but for the worse.
\v 18 For first of all, I hear that when you come together in the church, there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
\v 19 For there must also be factions among you, in order that those who are approved may be revealed among you.
