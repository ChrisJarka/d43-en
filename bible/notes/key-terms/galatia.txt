    * Paul addressed the letter of Galatians to churches in Galatia.
    * Where these churches were located and when the letter was written is open to some debate.
    * The churches at Galatia were gentile Christian churches, which were being influenced Jewish Christians, trying to persuade them to keep aspects of the Jewish law; hence, the occasion for Paul's letter.
