===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Did you bring me sacrifices ... Israel?** - Possible meanings are 1) God uses this question to rebuke them because they did not offer sacrifices. AT: "You did not bring me sacrifices ... Israel." or 2 ) God uses this question to remind them that the sacrifices were not the most important part about their relationship. AT: "You did not have to bring me sacrifices ... Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Did you bring** - God speaks as though the Israelites he is speaking to were part of the group that wandered in the wilderness. AT: "Did your ancestors bring" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to Israel's descendants. See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:05:01|5:1]]. AT: "you people of Israel" or "you Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **You have lifted up the images of Sikkuth ... and Kaiwan** - Here "lifted up the images" represents worshiping them. AT: "You have worshiped the images of Sikkuth ... and Kaiwan" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Sikkuth ... Kaiwan** - These are the names of two false gods. The people had made images to represent them.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Kaiwan** - Some versions write this as "Kiyyun."
