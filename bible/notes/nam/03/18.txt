===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Your** - This refers to the King of Assyria.
    * **Your shepherds sleep... your rulers are resting**  - The word "shepherds" refers to the leaders of Nineveh.  They are called shepherds because they as supposed to protect the people of the city as a shepherd protects his sheep.(See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]]) Both of these phrases refer to the leaders of Nineveh in different ways. (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]]) The words "sleep" and "resting" refer to death. Alternate translation: "Those who lead them are all dead"  (See:[[en:ta:translate:euphemism]])
    * **Who has escaped your constant wickedness** - This emphasizes the good that destruction of Assyria brings because they had hurt many people. Alternate translation: "Your constant wicked actions have hurt many people and nations"  (See:[[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
