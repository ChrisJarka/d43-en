\c 47
\p
\v 1 The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before that Pharaoh struck Gaza.
\p
\v 2 Thus says Jehovah: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow
the land and all that is therein, the city and them that dwell therein; and the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the
land shall wail.
\v 3 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his
wheels, the fathers look not back to their children for feebleness of hands;
\v 4 because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that remaineth:
for Jehovah will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.
\v 5 Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nought, the remnant of their valley: how long will you cut thyself?
\v 6 O you sword of Jehovah, how long will it be ere you be quiet? put up yourself into your scabbard; rest, and be still.
\v 7 How can you be quiet, seeing Jehovah has given you a charge? Against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore, there has
he appointed it.
