====== Ecclesiastes 02:13-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 And I thought, "Surely it is better to be wise than to be foolish,
\q2 like light is better than darkness,
\q1
\v 14 because wise people \add walk in the daylight and\add* [IDI] can see where they are going,
\q2 but foolish people walk in the darkness \add and cannot see where they are going\add*."
\q1 But I also realized that both wise people and foolish people eventually die.

\q1
\v 13 Then I began to understand
\q2 that wisdom has advantages over folly,
\q2 just as light is better than darkness.
\q1
\v 14 The wise man uses his eyes in his head to see where he is going,
\q2 but the fool walks in darkness,
\q1 although I know the same destiny is in store for everyone.
