====== Level 2 Checking (Language Community) ======

Level 2 checking will be done by a wider group of people from the language community. It is assumed that the checkers will be native speakers of the language. The purpose of this level of checking is to verify that a larger group of the target population agrees that the translation is a good one.

The primary questions that the community leaders should ask about the [[:en:bible:notes:checking:level2:qualifications|translator's qualifications]] are:

  * Is the translator recognized as a qualified local language speaker?
  * Does the translator have adequate national language skills?
  * Is the translator respected in the community as a follower of Christ?

The primary questions that the community leaders should ask about the translation are:

  * Do the words and phrases of the translation make the message [[:en:bible:notes:checking:level2:clear|clear]]?
  * When compared with the national translation, did the new translation follow the message [[:en:bible:notes:checking:level2:accuracy|accurately]] (not necessarily the same wording or the exact order)?
  * Does the flow of the language of the translation sound natural for the language group?
  * Does the translation include all the events of the book that was translated?
  * Is the translation written at a level and style appropriate for the local audience?
  * Is the alphabet and spelling used in the book appropriate for the wider language community?

Each of these topics are important, and will be further developed by clicking the highlighted words.


==== Natural Language ====

These are questions you can ask to see if the flow of the language of the translation sounds natural for your language group:

Q? Is there a good flow to the language when the passages are read out loud?

A. (Does the language sound like the writer was a person from your own community?)

Q? Does the writer use words well?

A. (Are the people and places of the story described using expressions commonly heard in your community?)

Q? Is this the way people talk in your area?

A. (Does the speaker sound strange or perhaps like someone from outside your community?)

==== All Text Included ====

Sometimes there are differences in verse numbering between translations, or sometimes certain verses are put in footnotes. Ask the following questions to see how the translator handled these situations:

Q? Does the translation include all the verses of the book that was translated?

A. (When you look at the verse numbering of the national translation, are all of the verses included in your language translation?)

Q? Are there places in the translation where something seems to be left out, or there seems to be a different message than is found in the national language?

A. (Other than the wording, does the language that the translator used cover the same message as the national language?)

==== Appropriate Level and Style ====

These are questions that will help determine whether or not the translation has been done in a style that is acceptable to the intended audience.

Q? Is the translation written at a level that can be understood easily by young and old members of the language community?

A. (Whenever someone speaks, they can change their choice of words for either a younger or an older audience. Is this translation done using words that suit a wide variety of people?)

Q? Is the style of this translation more formal or informal?

A. (Is the manner of speaking appropriate for the local audience?)

==== Appropriate Alphabet and Spelling ====

These questions will help to determine if an appropriate alphabet has been chosen to represent the sounds of the language and words have been written in a consistent way so that the translation will be easy to read:

Q? Is the alphabet suitable to represent the sounds of the language of the new translation?

A. (Are there any sounds that make a difference in meaning but have to use the same symbol as another sound? Does this make the words hard to read? Can additional marks be used to show the differences?)

Q? Is the spelling used in the book consistent?

A. (Are there rules that the writer should follow to show how words change in different situations? Can they be described so others will know how to read and write the language easily?)

Q? Is the dialect that the writer used an appropriate form of the language acceptable to the wider language community?

A. (Is the writer familiar with the dialects of your language found throughout the area? Has the writer used expressions, phrase connectors and spellings that will be recognized by a broad section of the language community?)
