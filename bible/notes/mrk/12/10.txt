\v 10 Have you not read even this scripture:
\q The stone which the builders rejected,
\q The same was made the head of the corner;
\q
\v 11 This was from the Lord,
\q And it is marvelous in our eyes?
\m
\v 12 And they sought to lay hold on him; and they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against
them: and they left him, and went away.
