===== Description =====



Apostrophe is a figure of speech in which someone speaks to someone or something that is not there as a way to let his audience understand his attitude toward that person or thing. He could even speak to a thing or idea that is treated as if it were a person (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]). 

**Reason this is a translation issue** \\ 
Many languages do not use apostrophe, and readers could be confused by it.\\ 

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to you** (Luke 13:34) \\ 
Jesus made this exclamation to the people of Jerusalem as if they were there listening to him. But he was outside the city, and the people of the city were not there listening to him. And some of what he said was addressed to people who had lived long ago and were no longer alive. In this way, he expressed his deep sadness about the people of Jerusalem.\\ 

**O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?** (1 Corinthians 15:55)
Paul quote the old

1 Kings 13:2 The man of God cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh and said, " Yahweh says, '... on you they will burn men's bones.'" 

**Come now, you who are rich, cry out loud because of the miseries coming upon you.** (James 5:1)\\ 
James wrote to the church, which was made up of poor people, as if rich people could hear him, showing his anger about what rich people were doing. 
===== Translation Strategies =====
If your language can use x consider using it. These strategies are for if your language cannot use x.

  - You may put the name of the one being spoken to first, to show that the speaker has drawn his attention away from his primary audience to another audience.
  - Some languages have a marker that shows that someone is being spoken to. For example, English speakers used to use "O" before saying the name of the one they were talking to as in "O Moab" and "O forest."
  - If this way of speaking would be confusing to your people, you may preserve the meaning of the apostrophe and let the speaker continue speaking to his audience. See the example of 1 Cor 15:55 in the UDB, below.

**__O death__, where is your victory? __O death__, where is your sting?"**  1 Corinthians 15:55 (ULB) \\ 
Paul was speaking to death as if it were a person and challenging it, because it will not have any power to harm people. \\ 
"Death will never win again! The pain of dying has been taken away!" 

===== Examples from English =====
__Silly dog,__  what are you barking for now?\\ 
\\ 
__Pesky phone__, why will you not let me call?
