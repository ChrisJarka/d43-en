\v 1 It was six days before the Passover celebration when Jesus arrived in Bethany. That was the village where Lazarus lived, the man Jesus made alive again after he had died.
\v 2 So there in Bethany, they gave a dinner to honor Jesus. Martha made preparations for the dinner, and Lazarus was among those who were enjoying the meal together.
\v 3 Then Mary took a bottle of expensive perfume (called nard) and to honor him, she poured it out on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. The fragrance of the perfume filled the house.

\p
\v 1 Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.
\v 2 So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.
\v 3 Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet
with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
