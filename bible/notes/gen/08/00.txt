====== General notes about Genesis 8 ======


**Formatting in this chapter**\\

The author's pattern of summary statements and of repeated presentation of the same events continues in this chapter. 

The last verse in this chapter (8:22), poetic, and the ULB presents it in this way:\\

"While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat,\\
summer and winter, and day and night will not cease."
