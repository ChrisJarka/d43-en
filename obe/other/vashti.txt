====== Vashti ======

===== Facts: =====

In the Book of Esther, Vashti is the wife of King Ahasuerus.

  * She refused to show off her beauty to the King's drunken guests and was banished from the court which created the opportunity for Esther to take her place.
  * Her refusal was seen as a great act of disrespect, and subsequently all women were ordered to be in subjection to their husbands.
