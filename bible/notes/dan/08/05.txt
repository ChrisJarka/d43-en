\v 5 As I was thinking about this, I saw a male goat came from the west, across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground. The goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.
\v 6 And he came to the ram who had the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal, and he ran toward him in his powerful anger.
