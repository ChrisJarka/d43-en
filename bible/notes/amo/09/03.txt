\v 3 And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from
my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.
\v 4 And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall kill them: and I
will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
