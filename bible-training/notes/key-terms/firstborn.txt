====== firstborn ======


===== Definition: =====


The firstborn refers to the initial offspring, whether of people or animals. In humans, the term refers exclusively to the first male child born to the man and woman.


    * In biblical times, the firstborn son is given a place of prominence and twice as much of his family inheritance as the other sons.
    * This concept can also be used figuratively. For example, the nation of Israel is called God's firstborn son because God gave it special privileges over other nations. The Son of God has always lived and was never born, but he is called God's firstborn son because of his importance.
    * This could also be translated as "the son who was born first"  or, "the eldest son" or, "the number one son."
