\v 8 Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
\v 9 Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brickwork, which is at the entry of Pharaohâ€™s house in
Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;
\v 10 and say to them, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king
of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over
them.
