===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - These verses continue describing the ruler from Bethlehem.

  * **He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of Yahweh** - A shepherd, who feeds and protects his sheep, is a metaphor for the ruler, who will provide for and protect the people of Israel. AT: "Yahweh will give him the strength to lead his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God** - The person's name is a metonym for person's authority. AT: "and people will honor him because Yahweh his God has given him the authority to rule" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **They will remain** - the people of Israel will remain
  * **remain** - "live in safety"
  * **he will be great to the ends of the earth** - All people from every nation will give honor to Israel's ruler.
  * **seven shepherds and eight leaders over men** - Here "shepherds" is a metonym for "rulers," another way of saying "leaders over men." The phrase "seven ... and eight" is an idiom for "more than enough." AT: "enough, even more than enough, rulers" or "more than enough shepherds and leaders over men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
