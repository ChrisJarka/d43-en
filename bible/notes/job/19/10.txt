===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Job continues to speak to his three friends.

  * **He has broken me down on every side** - Job speaks of God ruining him as if Job were building that God is smashing down. AT: "He has ruined me in every way" or "he has attacked me in every way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and I am gone** - Being "gone" represents being completely destroyed. AT: "and I am completely destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he has plucked up my hopes like a tree** - Job speaks of God causing Job not to have hope as if Job's hope were a tree and instead of cutting down the tree, God  pulled the whole tree with its roots out of the ground AT: "he has completely taken away all my hope" or "because of what he has done, I can no longer hope for anything good" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **He has also kindled his wrath against me** - Job speaks of God's wrath as if it were a fire. AT: "God has also lit a fire of anger against me" or "God has also become very angry with me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he regards me as one of his adversaries** - "he thinks of me as an enemy" or "God treats me like one of his enemies" 
  * **His troops come on together** - Job compares the way that God is attacking him to the way that an army attacks a city. AT: "God sends his army to attack me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **they cast up siege mounds against me** - The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. It may describe the way an army piles up dirt against a city wall in order to climb over the wall and attack the city. AT: "the soldiers pile up dirt in order to climb over my city wall." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and encamp around my tent** - AT: "they camp around my house and prepare the attack." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
