\v 31 But Joash replied, "Are you trying to defend Baal? Are you trying to argue his case? Anyone who tries to defend Baal should be executed by tomorrow morning! If Baal is truly a god, he ought to be able to defend himself, and to get rid of the person who tore down his altar!"
\v 32 From that time, people called Gideon Jerub-Baal, which means 'Baal should defend himself,' because he tore down Baal's altar.

\v 31 Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you fight for Baal? Will you save him? Whoever fights for him, let him be put to death while it is still morning. If Baal is a god, let him fight for himself, because someone has broken down his altar.”
\v 32 Therefore on that day he called Gideon Jerubbaal, saying, “Let Baal fight against him, because he has broken down his altar.”
