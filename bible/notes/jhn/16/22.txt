\v 22 And you therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes away
from you.
\v 23 And in that day you shall ask me no question. Verily, verily, I say to you, If you shall ask anything of the Father, he
will give it you in my name.
\v 24 Hitherto have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be made full.
