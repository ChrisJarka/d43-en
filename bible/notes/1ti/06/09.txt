\v 9 But some people strongly desire to be rich. As a result, they do wrong things to get money, and this will cause them to be caught as animals get caught in traps. They foolishly desire many things, and so they get hurt. God will completely destroy them!
\v 10 People do all sorts of evil things when they want to have a lot of money. Because some people longed for money, they have stopped believing the truth that all of us believe and they have caused themselves to be very sorrowful.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Now those who want to become wealthy fall into temptation, into a trap. They fall into many foolish and harmful passions, and into whatever else makes people sink into ruin and destruction.
\v 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people who desire it have been mislead away from the faith and have pierced themselves with much grief.

  * **fall into temptation** - "face more temptation than they can resist"
  * **fall...into a trap** - "become caught in a trap." This is a metaphor for being unable to act for one's own benefit and being helpless against those who would do one harm. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **fall...into many foolish and harmful passions** - "are controlled by the desire to do foolish and harmful things"
  * **makes people sink** - Paul speaks of ruin and destruction as if they were things that people could be pulled down into. AT: "pulls people down into" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil** - Paul speaks of the cause of evil as if it were a plant root. AT: "because loving money is a cause of all kinds of evil"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who desire it** - "who desire money"
  * **have been mislead away from the faith** - Paul speaks of wrong desires as if they were evil guides who intentionally guide people down the wrong path. AT: "have left the path of truth" or "have stopped believing the truth"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **have pierced themselves with...grief** - It is common for biblical language to speak of grief as if it were a knife or sword. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
