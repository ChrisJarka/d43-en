======  Matthew 13 General Notes ======


=== Formatting in this chapter ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of verses 14 and 15, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

This chapter can be set apart from other sections because they are parables of the kingdom of heaven. This chapter can be titled "Parables about the Kingdom."

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Parable ==

A parable is a short story used to illustrate a moral or religious lesson. In this chapter, the parables, reveal truth about the kingdom of heaven to those who have faith in Jesus. They also conceal these same truths from those who reject Jesus ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:10|13:11-13]]). These parables are often comparisons made to hypothetical situations.

==Synecdoche and Merism ==
In this chapter, Matthew references the eyes seeing and the ears hearing. This chapter uses these figures of speech to encourage his reader to understand these parable's lessons.
