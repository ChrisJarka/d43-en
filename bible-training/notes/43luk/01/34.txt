===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **How will this happen** - This can also be translated as, "How is this possible?" or, "I do not understand how this is possible." Though Mary did not understand how it could happen, she did not doubt that it would happen.
    * **come over you** - This can also be translated as "will come to you" or "will come down to you." This phrase and the next one are ways of saying that the Holy Spirit would supernaturally cause Mary to become pregnant even while she still remained a virgin. Make sure it is clear that there was no physical union involved; this was a miracle.
  *  **the Most High** -  This refers to God. The word "high" does not refer to physical height or distance, but to greatness or authority. This can also be translated as "the Most High One" or, "God Most High" or, "the Greatest One" or, "the Supreme."
    * **The power of the Most High will overshadow you**  - This could also be translated as "The Power of the Most High will cover you like a shadow" or, "The Power of the Most High One will be with you" or, "God Most High will cause this to happen by his power." Again, make sure this does not imply any physical union.
    * **the holy one** - That is, "the holy child" or, "the holy baby"
    * **will be called**  - This could also be translated as "people will call him" or, "people will acknowledge that he is."
