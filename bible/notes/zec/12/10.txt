\v 10 But I will pour out a spirit of favor and supplication upon the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
so they will look unto me, the one they have pierced!" They will mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son, and lament
 for him as of lamenting the death of a firstborn son.
\v 11 In that day the laments for Jerusalem will be like the funeral of Hadad-Rimmon in the plains of Megiddo.
