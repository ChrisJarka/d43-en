\v 7 I heard people say that you are cutting the wool from your sheep. Previously, when your shepherds were among us, we did not harm them. All the time that your shepherds were among us at Camel, we did not steal any sheep from them.
\v 8 You can ask your servants if this is true, and they will tell you \add that it is true\add*. We have come here at a time when you are celebrating, so I ask you to please be kind to us and give these men whatever extra food you have, for me, David, and my men to eat.'"

\v 7 And now I have heard that you have shearers: your shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was
there anything missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.
\v 8 Ask your young men, and they will tell thee: wherefore let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good
day: give, I pray thee, whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.
