===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The tombs were openedâ€¦**<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>- The "resurrection of many saints" is an event mentioned out of sequence here - probably because the earthquake and rending of rocks at Jesus' death also opened their tombs, according to several commentators. Commentators speculate that, either these awakened saints remained in the open tombs until after Jesus is raised some days hence or, they are raised when Jesus is. These raised saints entered the holy city "after Jesus' resurrection" and we never hear what became of them after that. Verse 54 actually happens immediately after verse 51, if the order of events in the passion story is crucial for rendering in a target culture.</font>
