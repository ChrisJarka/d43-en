\q
\v 11 Moab has felt secure since he was young. He is like his wine
\q that has never been poured from pot to pot. He has never gone into captivity.
\q Therefore he tastes as good as ever; his flavor remains unchanged.
\q
\v 12 So see, the days are coming—this is Yahweh's declaration—when I will send him those who will tip him over and pour out all his pots and shatter his jars.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Moab has felt secure since he was young ... He is ... his wine ... send him** - Here Yahweh speaks of Moab as if it were a man. Here it represents the people of Moab. All occurrences of "he," "his," and "him" in 48:11-12 can be stated as "they," "their," or "them." AT: "Even from their earliest times, the people of Moab have always felt secure ... They are ... their wine ... send them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) 
  * **He is like his wine that has never been poured from pot to pot** - For wine to taste good, it has to be left undisturbed for a long time and not poured from one pot to another. Yahweh compares the people who are prosperous because no one has ever conquered them and taken them as captives to wine that is undisturbed and has a good flavor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **So see, the days are coming** - "Listen carefully because there will be a time"
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I will send him those who will tip him over and pour out all his pots and shatter his jars** - The enemy army defeating the people of Moab and taking them as captives is spoken of as if the people of Moab are wine and someone will come and pour them out and break the wine jars. AT: "I will send an army that will destroy them as if they were pouring out wine and breaking the jars" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
