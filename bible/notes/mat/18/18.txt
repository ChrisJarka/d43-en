\v 18 Truly I say to you, whatever things you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever things you
shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\v 19 Moreover I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they ask for, it will be done
for them by my Father who is in heaven.
\v 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in their midst.
