\v 1 Now, my fellow believers, \add I will answer what you asked\add* about the things God's Spirit \add enables believers to do\add*. I want you to know clearly \f + \ft litotes \f* \add about these things\add*.
\v 2 You know that before you became Christians, various things led you to \add worship\add* idols, which are unable to tell you \add any of God's message\add*.
\v 3 So \add the first thing\add* that I will tell you now is that it is not the Spirit of God who would cause anyone to say, "Jesus deserved to die," and that the Holy Spirit is the only one who can enable anyone to say, "Jesus is \add truly\add* the Lord."

\v 1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I would not have you uninformed.
\v 2 You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to voiceless idols, however you were led.
\v 3 Therefore I want you to know that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus is accursed,"  and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.
