\v 9 When they realized the grace that was given to me, James, Cephas, and John, who are recognized as leaders, gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision, the Jews.
\v 10 They also wanted us to remember the poor, the very thing I was also eager to do.
