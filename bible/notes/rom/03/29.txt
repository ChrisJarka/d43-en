\v 29 You who are Jews certainly should not think that you are the only ones whom God will accept! You certainly should realize that he will accept non-Jews, too. Of course, he will accept non-Jews,
\v 30 because, as you firmly believe, there is only one God. It is this same God who will erase the record of Jews' sins if they trust in what Christ has done, and who will similarly erase the record of non-Jews' sins if they trust in Christ.
