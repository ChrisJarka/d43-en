\v 32 And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come hither, that I may send you to the king, to say,
Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the kingâ€™s face; and if
there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.
\v 33 So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his
face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
