====== Zechariah 08 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is a series of sayings from Yahweh of hosts, each an encouraging note for those returning from the exile to the land of Judah and Jerusalem. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 8:2b-13, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Note that the sections of verses are punctuated by the phrase: Yahweh of hosts says this.
