\v 24 A disciple should not \add expect to be\add* greater than his teacher, and servants \add are not\add* superior to their master.
\v 25 You do not \add expect that\add* people will \add treat\add* a disciple better than \add they treat\add* his teacher, or that\add they will treat\add* a servant \add better than they treat\add* his master. \add Similarly, because I am your teacher and master, you can expect that people will mistreat you, because they have mistreated me\add*. The most you can expect is that people \add will treat you like they treat me. I am like\add* the ruler of a household \f + \ft metaphor \f*. But people \add have insulted me by\add* calling \add me\add* Beelzebub, \add the ruler of the demons\add*. So they \add will\add* certainly \add insult you more, you who are only like\add* members of my household \f + \ft metaphor \f*!"

\v 24 A disciple should not expect to be greater than his teacher, and servants are not superior to their master.
\v 25 You do not expect that people will treat a student better than they treat his teacher, or that they will treat a servant better than they treat his master. Similarly, because I am your teacher and master, you can expect that people will mistreat you, because they have mistreated me. The most you can expect is that people will treat you like they treat me. I am like the ruler of a household, whom they call Satan. If they act that badly toward me, how do you think they will act toward you?"

\v 24 A disciple is not greater than his teacher, nor a servant above his master.
\v 25 It is enough for the disciple that he should be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of
the house Beelzebul, how much more them of his household!

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him.

  * **A disciple is not greater than his teacher**  - This could either mean 1) “A disciple does not have more knowledge than his teacher” or 2) “A disciple does not have more authority than his teacher.” If necessary, it can be written as "A teacher is never lower than his students."
  * **greater than**  - "above" or "superior to"
  * **nor a servant above his master**  - "and a servant is not greater than his master" or "a master is never lower than his servant"
  * **It is enough for the disciple that he should be like his teacher **- "The disciple should be satisfied to be like his teacher."
  * **be like his teacher **- The meaning here is "know as much as his teacher knows" or "be the same as his teacher."
  * **like his master**  - "as important as his master"
  * **If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more them of his household **- The meaning here is that if Jesus was being mistreated, the disciples of Jesus should expect to be treated the same or worse. (see UDB)
  * **If they have called**  - "If people have called"
  * **the master of the house **- Jesus is using "the master of the house" as a metaphor for himself. (See: Metaphor)
