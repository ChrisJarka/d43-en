\v 1 And in those days comes John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying,
\v 2 Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
\v 3 For this is he that was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\q The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
\q Make you ready the way of the Lord,
\q Make his paths straight.
\m
\v 4 Now John himself had his raiment of camelâ€™s hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild
honey.
\v 5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about the Jordan;
\v 6 and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
\v 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, You offspring of vipers, who
warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\v 8 Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance:
\v 9 and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these
stones to raise up children to Abraham.
\v 10 And even now the axe lies at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that brings not forth good fruit is hewn
down, and cast into the fire.
\v 11 I indeed baptize you in water to repentance: but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not
worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire:
\v 12 whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor; and he will gather his wheat into the
garner, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.

\v 13 Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized of him.
\v 14 But John would have hindered him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and come you to me?
\v 15 But Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it now: for thus it becomes us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
suffers him.
\v 16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw
the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him;
\v 17 and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
