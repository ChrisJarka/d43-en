==== translationNotes ====

In order to help translators  do the best translation work possible, translation notes were developed for each chunk of text. There are **exegetical notes** which help to explain the theological significance behind certain words and passages. There are **linguistic notes** which help to bring fuller understanding of the source language and how that language interacts with the original Biblical languages. There are **cultural notes** which help explain the Biblical culture.

==== Important Terms ====

In addition to all of this, there is a complete set of **important terms** found in the text with short articles explaining more fully who or what that term is and why it is significant. The important terms also come with **cross references** to other places in the text where that important term is used.
