===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 But this is what I say: 'I will not reject my people any quicker than I will change my laws that control the day and the night, the sky and the earth.
\v 26 Similarly, I will never abandon the descendants of David or the other descendants of Jacob, and I will always allow descendants of David to rule the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will bring them back to their land, and I will act mercifully toward them.'~"

<usfm>
\v 25 Thus says Jehovah: If my covenant of day and night stand
not, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;
\v 26 then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers
over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.
