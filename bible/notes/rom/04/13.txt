<usfm>
\v 13 God promised Abraham and his descendants that they would receive \add the blessings that he promised to give to the people in\add* the world. But when he promised that, it was not because Abraham \add obeyed\add* the laws \add that God later gave to Moses\add*. Instead, it was because Abraham believed \add that God would do what he promised that he would do\add*. As a result, God erased the record of his sins.
\v 14-15 If \add we think that\add* it is those who \add obey God's\add* laws who will receive \add what he has promised\add*, it is useless \add for us to think that he will erase the record of our sins just because we\add* trust in him. And it is pointless \add for us to think that he will give us what he\add* promised \add just because\add* we trust in him. \add Remember that\add* it is \add stated\add* in God's law \f + \ft personification \f* \add that\add* he will punish \add people who do not perfectly obey them\add*, and remember that wherever \f + \ft metonymy \f* laws exist, \add people\add* disobey them \f + \ft litotes \f*.

\p
\v 13 For not through the Law was the promise given to Abraham or to his descendants for him to be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.
\v 14 For if those of the law are heirs, faith is made empty and the promise is nullified.
\v 15 For the Law brings about wrath, but where there is no law neither is there disobedience.
