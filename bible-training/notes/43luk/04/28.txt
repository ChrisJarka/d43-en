====== Luke 4:28-30 ======


===== TFT: =====

<sup>28</sup> When all the people in the synagogue heard him say that, they were very angry, //because they realized that he was inferring that he similarly would help non-Jewish people instead of helping Jews// (OR, //that they also were not worthy of receiving God's help//). <sup>29</sup> So they all got up and shoved him out of the town. They took him to the top of the hill outside their town in order to throw him off the cliff //and kill him//. <sup>30</sup> But he //simply// walked through their midst and went away.
