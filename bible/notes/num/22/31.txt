\v 31 Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.
\v 32 And the angel of Jehovah said to him, Wherefore have you struck your ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because your way is perverse before me:
\v 33 and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive.
