\v 7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you:
\v 8 for every one that asks receiveth; and he that seeks findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
\v 9 Or what man is there of you, who, if his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone;
\v 10 or if he shall ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?
