===== Description =====

Occasionally an author may take a break from the storyline to share something of interest. This break usually contains background information. An author may use background information for several reasons:

  * To add interest to the story.
  * To provide important historical or cultural information.
  * To tell the reader, or listener, something very important


===== Template =====

Notes should follow this format:

  * **phrase from ULB**  -


===== Bible Examples =====

=== Act:08:09 ===

"But there was a certain man in the city named Simon, who had earlier been practicing sorcery; he used to astonish the people of Samaria, while claiming that he was an important person."

  * **the city**  - "the city in Samaria." "in Samaria" is background information. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:writingstyles|Writing Styles - Background Information]])

=== Gen:16:16 ===

"Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram."

  * **Abram was**  - This introduces background information about Abram's age when these things happened. Your language may have a special way to mark background information. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:writingstyles]])

=== Ref:ch:vv ===

"ULB text of the verse for which the note is created."
