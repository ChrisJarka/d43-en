=== What is Ezekiel about? ===

This book contains prophecies that were given between 592 BC and 573 BC. Ezekiel tells the Jewish people in exile in Babylonia that God has punished them for their sin and unfaithfulness to him, but that he will restore Judah. God is using Babylon to punish them, but the enemy nations will be crushed in their turn. There is prophecy about the restoration and renewal of worship, the sacrificial system, and the new temple. The book of Ezekiel ends with the reallocation of the Israel's land among all the tribes of Israel. Ezekiel concludes with the overarching principle that “Yahweh is there." 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

"Ezekiel" may also be called the "The Messages from God brought by Ezekiel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). 

=== Who wrote the Book of Ezekiel? ===

The prophecies in the Book of Ezekiel came through Ezekiel, a prophet who lived near Babylon in the time of the exile. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What was Ezekiel's temple? ===

A large portion of the Book of Ezekiel gives instructions regarding the building of a new temple. However, this temple is not the same as the temple the people would build after going back to Jerusalem. Because Ezekiel's temple has never been built, some people believe that this temple is to be built in the future. Others believe that Ezekiel's temple is symbolic of the Church.

=== Do the sacrifices in Ezekiel follow the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of moses]]? ===

If one was to compare some of the required sacrifices in Numbers 28 with the sacrifices in Ezekiel 46, there are some differences. These differences probably exist because Ezekiel prophesies about a new temple with a new sacrificial system.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

===How do I translate Ezekiel's visions?===

The book of Ezekiel has many dazzling visions and stunning images. Ezekiel is very different from the message or manner of prophecy of most of the prophetic books. His visions are complicated and far-reaching, his speech is ecstatic, and these prophecies became the foundation for many apocalyptic books of Scripture. His visions should be read as they stand, with care to neither make them more rational and real, nor to read into them what may be only suggested by the text.
Also, there are events recorded where it is unclear if Ezekiel has traveled to particular places, or that he simply “sees” the places he is describing. The meaning of the visions may be clear, but the point of view of the prophet may be difficult to grasp. The visions and euphoric language can be difficult to follow, but the focus in on Israel’s rescue and events in the far distant future.

===What does "and you will know that I am the Lord" mean?===

This is a common phrase that in Ezekiel. It speaks of the inevitability of God's judgment and that he will bring about what he has promised. The translator may also use the phrase "and you will understand that I am God and what I say will happen."

===What is an allegory?===
