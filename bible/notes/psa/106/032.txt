\q
\v 32 They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,
\q So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;
\q
\v 33 Because they were rebellious against his spirit,
\q And he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.
\q
\v 34 They did not destroy the peoples,
\q As Jehovah commanded them,
\q
\v 35 But mingled themselves with the nations,
\q And learned their works,
\q
\v 36 And served their idols,
\q Which became a snare to them.
