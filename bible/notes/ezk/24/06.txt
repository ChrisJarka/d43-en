  * **Woe to the city of blood**  - Alternate Translation : "Terrible things will happen to Jerusalem; it is city that is full of murderers" (UDB).
  * **a cooking pot**  - a big pot to cook something in. The cooking pot represents the 'city of Jerusalem'.
  * **rust**  - This is a red coloured substance that forms on metal or iron and ruins it. This term rust refers to the bad or wicked people of Jerusalem.
  * **that rust will not come out of it**  - Alternate Translation: "that rust cannot be removed" (UDB). This means that there is so much of wickedness or corruption that nothing can be done.
  * **Take piece after piece from it**  - This refers to the people that were in Jerusalem, of every class and rank, of every age and gender; suggesting that they should not be all destroyed at once, but some at one time, and some at another.
  * **But the lot will not fall upon it**  - Alternate Translation: "but do not choose which pieces to take out." (UDB) "lot" is from "casting lots" so more a ramdom chance than a decision.
