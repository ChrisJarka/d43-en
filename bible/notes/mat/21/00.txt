======  Matthew 21 General Notes ======


=== Formatting in this chapter ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of verses 5, 16 and 42, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Donkey ==

The image of Jesus entering into Jerusalem was similar to the way a king would have entered into a city after a great victory on a great horse or chariot. Jesus, the king of kings, entered the city in humility on a simple donkey. He was about to suffer a great defeat at the cross which would be a great victory.

== Hypothetical Situation ==
Jesus uses  hypothetical situation as a means of teaching people in this chapter as well as condemn the attitudes of the Jewish leaders. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== The kingdom will be taken away from you ==
Scholars are divided over the meaning of this phrase. An essential question: would this be a permanent or temporary event? If possible, leave both these possibilities open in your translation.
