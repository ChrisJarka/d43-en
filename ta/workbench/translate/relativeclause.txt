  * [[Sentence Structure]]

In some languages, clauses can tell about a noun in the sentence. These are called **relative** clauses.

   * Relative clauses can **define **  which thing is being talked about. For example: '//She put a little food in her own bag and a lot of food in the bag __that belonged to her sister__//.' This relative clause '//that belonged to her sister//' defines which bag.
  * Relative clauses can **describe**  or tell some more information. For example: '//She gave some of the food to her only sister, __who was very thankful__.//' The clause “//who was very thankful//” tells something about the sister. Since she had only one sister, it does not tell which sister. It simply tells how her sister responded.

Some languages can use relative clauses both to define and describe. Other languages only use them for defining.
