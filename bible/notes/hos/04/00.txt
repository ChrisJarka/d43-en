====== Hosea 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

As you noticed in the outline of Hosea in the Introduction, chapter 4 starts a new section of the book. This chapter is written in poetic form. The author is no longer using the metaphor of a husband wife relationship. But he is employing a new word picture using lawsuits. God is suing the people of Israel because of all the wrong they have done. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Lawsuits ==

Lawsuits are special cases where people go to court when they have a legal issue to resolve between them. Normally one party is accusing another party of a wrong doing. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

Metonymy is used in the first few verses of this chapter. 

Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. A metonym is a word or phrase used as a substitute for something it is associated with.

bloodshed is associated with murder.
stumbling represents sinning. 





=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

The reason for the lawsuit is Israel's pursuit of other gods or what we call idolatry.
