===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus is continuing his conversation with Peter from the previous scripture. 
    * **He said “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter said... you know that I love you ** - In the original language there are multiple words which mean "love." The word "love" which both Jesus and Peter use here means,"brotherly love” or “love for a friend or family member.” This is natural human love between friends or relatives. 
    * **Feed my sheep**  - Alternate translation “Feed the people that also love me.” (See: Metonymy)
    * **Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to clothe yourself and walk wherever you wished; but when you become old, you will stretch out your hands, and another person will clothe you and carry you where you will not wish to go.”**  - (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
