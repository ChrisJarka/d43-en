===== Bible Examples =====

=== Gen:22:12 ===

"He said, "Do not lay your hand upon the lad, nor do anything to harm him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing that you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.""

  * **Do not lay your hand upon the lad, nor do anything to harm him**  - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing: "Do not hurt the boy in any way." God made sure that Abraham would hear and understand him. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:doublet|Doublet]])

=== Luk:01:71 ===

"He promised to provide for us salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of everyone who hates us."

  * **enemies..all who hate us**  - This is a doublet in which "enemies" and "all who hate us" both refer to those who are against God's people. This could be translated as "people who fight against us and want to harm us." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:doublet|Doublet]])

=== 2Th:01:04 ===

"So we ourselves speak proudly about you among the churches of God concerning your patience and faith in all your persecutions and afflictions that you endure. "

  * **persecutions and afflictions**  This is an expression of saying the same thing different ways for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:doublet|Doublet]])
