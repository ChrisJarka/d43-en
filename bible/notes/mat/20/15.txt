===== Important Terms: =====

  * Possessions
  * Evil

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * This is continuing the story of the landowner and the workers.  
  * **Is it not legitimate for me to do what I wish with my own possessions**  -This is a rhetorical question. The landowner is saying that he is allowed to do whatever he wants with his own possessions. This can be translated "Because I own these things, I can do what I want". (See Rhetorical Questions.)
  * **Legitimate**  - This word means something is right or all right
  * **Or is your eye evil because I am good** - This rhetorical question could mean that the workers hired first were upset because the landowner was doing what he thought was right. This can be translated "You are angry because I am being fair". (See: Rhetorical Question) 
  * **eye evil**  - The eye is not referring to magic. Rather, this synecdoche is referring to what a person thinks is important. (See: synecdoche)
