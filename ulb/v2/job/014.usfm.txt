\c 14
\b
\q
\v 1 Man, that is born of a woman,
\q Is of few days, and full of trouble.
\q
\v 2 He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down:
\q He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
\q
\v 3 And do you open your eyes upon such a one,
\q And bring me into judgment with thee?
\q
\v 4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
\q
\v 5 Seeing his days are determined,
\q The number of his months is with thee,
\q And you have appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
\q
\v 6 Look away from him, that he may rest,
\q Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.
\b
\q
\v 7 For there is hope of a tree,
\q If it be cut down, that it will sprout again,
\q And that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
\q
\v 8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,
\q And the stock thereof die in the ground;
\q
\v 9 Yet through the scent of water it will bud,
\q And put forth boughs like a plant.
\q
\v 10 But man dieth, and is laid low:
\q Yea, man gives up the ghost, and where is he?
\q
\v 11 As the waters fail from the sea,
\q And the river wastes and dries up;
\q
\v 12 So man lies down and rises not:
\q Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake,
\q Nor be roused out of their sleep.
\b
\q
\v 13 Oh that you would hide me in Sheol,
\q That you would keep me secret, until your wrath be past,
\q That you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!
\q
\v 14 If a man die, shall he live again?
\q All the days of my warfare would I wait,
\q Till my release should come.
\q
\v 15 You would call, and I would answer thee:
\q You would have a desire to the work of your hands.
\q
\v 16 But now you numberest my steps:
\q Do you not watch over my sin?
\q
\v 17 My transgression is sealed up in a bag,
\q And you fastenest up mine iniquity.
\b
\q
\v 18 But the mountain falling comes to nought;
\q And the rock is removed out of its place;
\q
\v 19 The waters wear the stones;
\q The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth:
\q So you destroy the hope of man.
\q
\v 20 You prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth;
\q You change his countenance, and send him away.
\q
\v 21 His sons come to honor, and he knows it not;
\q And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
\q
\v 22 But his flesh upon him has pain,
\q And his soul within him mourneth.
