    * **sent out a decree **- A decree is a must-do order. It has to be followed. It was sent out from Rome, and was spread and announced to different parts of the Roman world.
    * **census**  - A census is an official counting and recording of all the people in an area or country. It was used to collect taxes.
    * **that a census be taken of all the people living in the Roman world**- That is, "that they register all the people living in the Roman world" or, "that they count all the people in the Roman world and write down their names."
    * **the Roman world**  - That is, "the part of the world controlled by the Roman government" or, "the countries ruled by the Roman emperor" or, "the Roman empire."

    * **to be registered for the census**  - That is, "to have their name written in the register" or, "to be included in the official count."
    * **everyone went-** the original language (OL) indicates the registration was an ongoing activity. The thought could be conveyed in translations that individuals took the necessary travel time without wasting time as perhaps the decree carried with it a punishment for failure to register
    * **text**  - note
