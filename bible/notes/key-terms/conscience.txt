====== conscience ======

===== Definition: =====

The conscience is the part of a person that makes a person aware that he is doing something sinful. It is an inner sense of what is the right thing to do.

  * God gave people a conscience to help them know the difference between what is right and what is wrong.
  * A person who pays attention to what God is telling him through his conscience and consistently obeys him is said to have a "pure" or "clear" or "clean" conscience.
  * If someone ignores what God is telling him and keeps sinning, that person's conscience becomes more and more insensitive so that the person may no longer feel guilty when he sins. The Bible calls this a "seared" or "insensitive"  or "polluted" conscience.
  * This word may need to be translated with a phrase depending on the context.
