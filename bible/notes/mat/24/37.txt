\v 37-39 It will be like what happened when Noah lived. Until the flood came, \add the people\add* did not know that \add anything bad would happen\add* to them. Before the flood waters covered the earth, \add the people\add* were eating and drinking \add as usual\add*. Some men were marrying women and \add some parents\add* were giving their daughters to men to marry them. They were doing all this until the day that Noah \add and his family\add* entered the big boat. And then the flood came and drowned all \add those who were not in the boat\add*. Similarly, \add the unbelieving people will not know\add* when \add I, the one who came from heaven\add*, will return, \add and they will not\add* be \add expecting me\add*.

\v 37 And as were the days of Noah, so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
\v 38 For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until
the day that Noah entered into the ark,
\v 39 and they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
