\v 22 It will be the same with you. Now \add I will die and\add* you will be sad. But after that, I will see you again. Then you will be joyful, and no one will be able to stop you from being joyful.
\v 23 When that happens, you will not ask me any questions \add about anything\add*. Listen to this carefully: \add After that happens, my\add* Father will do for you anything you ask, because of his relationship with me \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 24 Up to the present time you have not asked \add God to do\add* anything for you because of his relationship with me \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Now keep asking \add him for things that you need. If you do that\add*, you will receive them, and then you will be completely joyful.

\v 22 You, like her, have sorrow now, but I will see you again. Then God will give you great joy. There is no one who is able to take your joy from you.
\v 23 On that day, you will not be able to ask me about anything. I promise that this is the truth: Whatever you ask the Father, he will it give it to you, when you ask in my name.
\v 24 Up to now, you've not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive it, and you will have joy that fills everything.

<usfm>
\v 22 And you therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes away
from you.
\v 23 And in that day you shall ask me no question. Verily, verily, I say to you, If you shall ask anything of the Father, he
will give it you in my name.
\v 24 Hitherto have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be made full.
