~~DISCUSSION~~{{tag>check}}

Manager:

I added "descendant" as an important term because this chunk is talking about descendants of Ladan, his posterity, and the word "descend" is used in the ULB. My comment on the Shimei of verse 7 being a different person than the one whose sons are listed in verse 9 is based on commentary from Elliott's Commentary for English Readers (1 Chr 23:8-9), Pulpit Commentary (1 Chr 23:8-9), and Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges (1 Chr 23:9), all accessed through biblestudytools.com. Please also see verse 10 in the next chunk, which seems to indicate the two are the same person, because both UDB and TFT have modified the word "sons" with the word "other."
