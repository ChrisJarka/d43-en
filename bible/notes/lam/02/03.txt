===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues the use of metaphors to express God's opposition to Judah.

  * **cut off all the strength of Israel** - The word that is translated "strength" here is literally the "horn" of an animal, which in this imagery God "has cut off." The horn is what an animal uses to attack and defend. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **drawn back his right hand** - The "right hand" is used as a symbol of power or strength. God has stopped protecting Israel from their enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He has bent his bow at us like an enemy. He has stood in battle position as an adversary with his hand ready to shoot.** - These two sentences mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He has bent his bow at us** - When a soldier fixed an arrow in the bow and pulled it back to shoot, this bent the bow. AT: "He prepared his bow to shoot us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **In the tent of the Daughter of Zion** - The word "tent" may refer to the houses in Jerusalem, or those who live in them. AT: "On the people who live in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **poured out his wrath like fire** - God's anger, like fire, completely destroys things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
