<usfm>
\v 26 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice:
\v 27 but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Jehovah
before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to
our children in time to come, You have no portion in Jehovah.
