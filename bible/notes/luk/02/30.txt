===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **your salvation**  - This refers to Jesus, the one through whom God would save people. This can also be translated as "the one you have sent to save people" or "the one you have sent to be our Savior." (See: Metonymy)
    * **which you have prepared**  - This could mean "planned before the foundation of the world" or, "caused to happen before the people at the time of Christ's birth."
    * **peoples**  - That is, "people groups."
    * **It will be** - This refers to God's salvation. If you translate "salvation" as "the one you sent...", then it would be clearer to say "He will be."
    * **light for revealing truth**  - That is, "this child will enable people to perceive accurately the truth of God, as light allows people to see accurately."
    * **will be the glory of your people Israel**  - That is, "the best, most wonderful thing that will ever come from your people Israel."
