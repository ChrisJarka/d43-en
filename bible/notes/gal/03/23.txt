\v 23 Before God revealed the good message about trusting in Christ, the laws that God gave to Moses were confining/imprisoning us Jews, as a prisoner in jail is confined. We were unable to escape obeying those laws. This happened in order that we might believe the good message concerning Christ, the message that God would reveal later.
\v 24 Like a father supervises his immature son by appointing a servant to take care of him, God was supervising us by his laws until Christ came. He did this in order that he might erase the record of our sins only because we trust Christ.
\v 25 But now that God has revealed the message about trusting in Christ, the laws that God gave to Moses are no longer supervising us Jews.


\p
\v 26 Now all of you Jews and non-Jews are as though you are God's children because you trusted Christ Jesus.

\v 23 But before faith in Christ came the law imprisoned us, confined until God revealed the way of faith.
\v 24 So then the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
\v 25 Now that faith has come we are no longer under a tutor.
\v 26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
