\v 54 And even if a fellow Israelite who has sold himself to a rich man is not able to pay for himself to be freed by any of these ways, he and his children must be freed in the Year of Celebration,

\v 53 As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in your sight.
\v 54 And if he be not redeemed by these means, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him.
\v 55 For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
