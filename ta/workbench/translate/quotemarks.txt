Some languages use quotation marks to mark off direct quotations from the rest of the text. When a quotation is very long, or when a quotation has many layers of quotes within quotes, some languages intense the main quote. 

==== Description ====

Some languages use quotation marks to mark off direct quotes from the rest of the text. In English these quotation marks are called "inverted commas." They are the marks around the phrase "inverted commas."

  * John said "I don't know when I will arrive."

Quotation marks are not used with indirect quotes.

  * John said that he did not know when he would arrive.

When quotations have direct quotes inside of them, English alternates double inverted commas with single inverted commas. The outermost quote has double inverted commas, and the next quote inside has single inverted commas. The next quote inside of that has double inverted commas.

  * Mary said, "John said, 'I don't know when I will arrive.' "
  * Bob said, "Mary said, 'John said, "I don't know when I will arrive." ' "

When there are many layers of quotes inside of quotes, it might be hard for readers to understand who is saying what. Alternating double inverted commas with single inverted commas can help careful readers to keep track of them. 

If a quote is very long, the quote marks around it can be removed and the whole quote can be indented. This means that the quote is moved a little bit toward the middle of the page. This helps the reader see that all of that text is part of the quotation.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

=== Examples of a one-layered quotations === 

A first level direct quote is normally marked off with double quote marks. 

> So the king replied, "That is Elijah the Tishbite." (2 Kings 1:8 ULB)

=== Examples of two-layered quotations === 

A second level direct quote is marked off with single quote marks.

> They asked him, “Who is the man that said to you, __‘Pick up your bed and walk’__?” (John 5:12 ULB)

> … he sent two of the disciples, saying, “Go into the next village. As you enter, you will find a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me. If any one asks you, __'Why are you untying it?'__ say, ‘The Lord has need of it.’ ”  (Luke 19:29-31 ULB)

=== Example of a three-layered quotation ===

The third level direct quote is marked off with double quotes.

> Abimelech said to Abraham, “What prompted you to do this thing?” Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. When God caused me to leave my father’s house and travel from place to place, I said to her, ‘You must show me this faithfulness as my wife: At every place where we go, say about me, __“He is my brother.”__ ’ ”   (Genesis 20:10-13 ULB)

=== Example of a four-layered quotation ===

The fourth level direct quote is marked off with single quotes.

>When the messengers returned to Ahaziah, he said to them, “Why have you returned?” They said to him, “A man came to meet us who said to us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, “Yahweh says this: __‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die.’__ ” ’ ”  (2 Kings 1:5-6 ULB)

==== Translation Strategies ====

In some languages it would sound strange and perhaps even be confusing it there hare many levels of embedded direct quotes. Some use only direct quotes and others use only indirect ones. Here are ways to indicate quotes within quotes:

  - Use double quote marks and single quote marks for direct quotations within quotations as shown in the examples above.
  - Translate one or some of the quotes as indirect quotes. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  - If a quotation is very long and has many quotations within it, do not use quote marks on the main, overall quotation. Instead indent it, and use quote marks only for the quotations within it.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1) Use double quote marks and single quote marks for direct quotations within quotations as shown in the examples above.

  * **Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.’ ”**  (Exodus 16:11-12 ULB)

    * Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.’ ”

2) Translate one or some of the quotes as indirect quotes. The indirect quotes do not have quote marks around them. We have underlined words that show the changes in the pronouns and verbs because of the indirect quotes.

  * **Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.’ ” **  (Exodus 16:11-12 ULB)
    * Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them __that__ at twilight __they__ will eat meat, and in the morning __they__ will be filled with bread. Then __they__ will know that I am the Lord __their__ God.”

  * **They said to him, "A man came to meet us who said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, "Yahweh says this: 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die.' " ' " **  (2 Kings 1:6 ULB) 
    * They told to him __that__ a man came to meet __them__  who said to __them__, “Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, ‘Yahweh says this: “Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die." ’ "

3) If a quotation is very long and has many quotations within it, do not use quote marks on the main, overall quotation. Instead indent it, and use quote marks only for the quotations within it.
  * **They said to him, "A man came to meet us who said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, "Yahweh says this: 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die.' " ' " **  (2 Kings 1:6 ULB) 

They said to him,
> A man came to meet us who said to us, "Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, 'Yahweh says this: "Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die." ' "
