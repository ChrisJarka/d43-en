===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples not to worry about food and possessions.)
    * **nations**  - this may be a hard word to translate for indigenous tribal peoples who see clan and tribal membership as the most important "national" association and who may or may not be aware that they are a part of a nation. Perhaps "large countries" would work?
