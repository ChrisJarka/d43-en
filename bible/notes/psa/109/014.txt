===== Translation Notes: =====

David continues to ask Yahweh to punish a person who attacked him with his words and returned hatred for his love.
  * **May his ancestor's sins be mentioned to Yahweh** - AT: "May you remember the sins of his ancestors, Yahweh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **and may the sin of his mother not be forgotten** - AT: "and do not forgive the sin of his mother."
  * **May his guilt always be before Yahweh** - "May their sins always be before Yahweh." David describes the memory of the sins of the wicked man's ancestors and mother as a person continually standing in front of Yahweh. AT: "May Yahweh continually think about their sins." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **may Yahweh cut off his memory from the earth** - David uses the word "earth" to refer to all the people that live on the earth. AT: "may yahweh make it so that no one on earth remembers their family." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **never bothered to show kindness** - "never remembered to be kind" or "never remembered to love faithfully"
  * **harassed** - rush after in order to kill. This can be translated as "pursued" or "hunted down" or "persecuted."
  * **the oppressed** - "a person who was suffering"
  * **and needy** - "and in need." This person does not have something he needs like food, water, cloths, or a house to sleep in. 
  * **and killed the disheartened** - AT: "in order to kill a person who had lost hope" or "in order to kill a person who was terrified." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
