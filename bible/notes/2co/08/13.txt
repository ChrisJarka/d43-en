\v 13 I do not mean that \add you should give so much to help others that\add* you yourselves do not have what you need. No, what I want is that \add both you and others\add* will have what\add you need\add*.
\v 14 Right now, when you have more \add than you need\f + \ft Or: \add*plenty \f* and \add the believers in Judea\add* do not have enough\f + \ft Or: all that they need \f*, \add with your gift you will enable them to have enough. Maybe some day\add* when you do not have enough\f + \ft Or: all that you need \f* and they have more than they need, they will \add be able to\add* help you. Then everyone will have enough \f + \ft Or: In that way each will share alike \f*.
\v 15 \add If that happens, the result will be like it is written\add* \f + \ft Or:\add like someone, Or: Moses\add* wrote \f* \add in the Scriptures about the time when God provided manna for his people\add*,
\p If someone gathered a lot \add of manna\add*, he still did not have more than he needed, \add because he gave some to someone who did not have enough\add*. And those who gathered only a little \add manna\add* still had all that they needed \f + \ft litotes \f*, \add because others who gathered more than they needed gave some manna to them\add*.

\v 13  This is not so that others would be relieved of their responsibility and that their duties would fall on you. But the sharing of responsibilities should be fair and equitable for all who are involved.
\v 14 You had more than you needed at this current time, and that will supply what they need, and in the future, they will have more than they need, and they can give you assistance. That is fair for everyone.
\v 15 It is written in scripture, 
\q "The one who had much did not have anything left to share;
\q1 but the one who had only a little did not have any need at all."

<usfm>
\v 13 For this is not so others would be relieved and you would be burdened. But there should be fairness.
\v 14 Your abundance at the current time will supply what they lack. So that their abundance may also supply your need, and that there may be fairness,
\v 15 as it is written, 
\q "The one with much did not have anything left over; 
\q1 but the one who had little did not have any need."
