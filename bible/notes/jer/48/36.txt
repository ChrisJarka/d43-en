  * **my heart** - Possible meanings are 1) "my" refers to Jeremiah or 2) "my" refers to Yahweh.
  * **Kir Heres** - Kir-heres was an ancient capital of Moab. See how you translated this name in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:48:30|48:31]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **For every head is bald and every beard shaved. Incisions are on every hand, and sackcloth is around their waists** - These are all things that the people of Moab did when they were mourning or expressing deep sorrow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
