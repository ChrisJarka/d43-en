\v 1 He that dasheth in pieces is come up against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make your loins strong, fortify your
power mightily.
\v 2 For Jehovah restoreth the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out, and
destroyed their vine-branches.
\v 3 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his
preparation, and the cypress spears are brandished.
\v 4 The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches; they run
like the lightnings.
\v 5 He remembers his nobles: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared.
\v 6 The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.
\v 7 And it is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating upon
their breasts.

\v 8 But Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away. Stand, stand,
they cry; but none looks back.
\v 9 Take you the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.
\v 10 She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees strike together, and anguish is in all loins, and
the faces of them all are waxed pale.
\v 11 Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion
and the lioness walked, the lionâ€™s whelp, and none made them afraid?
\v 12 The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and
his dens with ravin.
\v 13 Behold, I am against thee, says Jehovah of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour
your young lions; and I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall no more be heard.
