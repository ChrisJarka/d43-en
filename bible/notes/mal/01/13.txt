\v 13 You also say, 'We are tired of burning all these sacrifices on the altar.' You turn up your noses at doing this. You bring sheep or goats that wild animals have attacked and torn in two. You also bring animals are are sick or that cannot walk. You cannot really think that I should accept these from you, can you?" This is what Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says. 

\p
\v 14 Yahweh also says, "I will curse anyone who tries to cheat me by swearing he will bring to me a perfect animal from his herd, and who then brings me one that has defects. If anyone does that, I will punish him, because I am a great king, and people of the other nations honor me, but you do not!" This is what Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says.

\v 13 "You also say, 'How tiresome this is,' and you distainfully snort at it," says Yahweh of Hosts. "You bring what has been
taken by a wild animal or is lame or sick; and this you bring as your offering! Should I accept this from your hand?" says
Yahweh.
\v 14 Cursed be the deceiver, who has a male animal in his flock and vows it to give it to me, and yet sacrifices to me, the Lord, what is flawed;
for I am a great King," says Yahweh of Hosts, "and my name is feared among the nations."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **"You also say, -**  "You say,"
  * **'How tiresome this is,' and you disdainfully snort at it," - **"'How hard it is to serve Yahweh,' and you rudely rebel against my rules." To snort means to make sounds through the nose. The phrase 'disdainfully snort at it' is another way of saying 'show great disrespect to it.'  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]]) 
  * **"You bring what has been taken by a wild animal or is lame or sick; and this you bring as your offering!-**  "You bring offerings to the altar that have been killed by a wild animal or are lame or sick!"
  * **Should I accept this from your hand?"-** "Should I accept this from you?" This question is a rebuke that expects a negative answer.  It may be stated as:  "I should certainly not accept this from you!"  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]).  The phrase "from your hand" is a figure of speech called Metonymy. The phrase means “by” or “through” the action of that person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **Cursed be the deceiver, who has a male animal in his flock and vows it to give it to me-**  "I will punish  anyone who lies to me who has a physically perfect male animal in his herd and promises to give it to me as an offering"
  * **and yet sacrifices to me, the Lord, what is flawed; -**  "and then sacrifices to me, the Lord, an animal that is not physically perfect."
  * **"my name is feared among the nations. -**  The word "feared" can mean "honored" or "revered" or "admired".
  * **Name** is discussed in 1:10-12 Translation Notes.
