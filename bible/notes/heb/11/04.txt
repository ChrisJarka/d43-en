\v 4 It was because \add Adam's son\add* Abel trusted God that he sacrificed something better to God than what \add his older brother\add* Cain offered to God. Because Abel did that, when God spoke well about what Abel sacrificed, God declared that Abel was righteous. And although Abel is dead, we still learn from him \add about trusting God\add*.

\v 4 Because Adam's son Abel trusted God, he sacrificed something better to God than what his older brother Cain offered to God. So God spoke well about what Abel sacrificed, and God declared that Abel was righteous. And although Abel is dead, we still learn from him about trusting God.

\v 4 It was by faith that Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. It was because of this that he was attested to be righteous. He was attested for this because of his gifts to God. Because of that, Abel still speaks, even though he died.
