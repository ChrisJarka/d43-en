\v 17 This is what I am saying: \add Since God\add* gave the laws \add to the Jews\add* 430 years after \add he declared to Abraham what he was promising to do for Abraham\add*, those laws do not cancel that agreement \add with\add* Abraham that God himself had previously agreed about \f + \ft personification \f*.
\v 18 Remember that if it is because \add we obey God's\add* laws \add that he gives to us\add* what \add he has\add* promised \add to give to us\add*, then it is not \add just\add* because he \add has\add* promised \add that he would give those things to us\add*. God freely gave to Abraham \add what he had promised to give to him, just\add* because \add God had\add* promised \add that he would give it to him. Similarly, it is not because we obey God's laws that God gives to us what he has promised to give to us\add*.

\v 17 This is what I am saying: Since God gave the laws to the Jews 430 years after he declared to Abraham what he was promising to do for Abraham, those laws do not cancel that agreement with Abraham that God himself had previously agreed about.
\v 18 Remember that if it is because we obey God's laws that he gives to us what he has promised to give to us, then it is not just because he has promised that he would give those things to us. God freely gave to Abraham what he had promised to give to him, just because God had promised that he would give it to him. Similarly, it is not because we obey God's laws that God gives to us what he has promised to give to us.

\v 17 Now I say this: The covenant confirmed beforehand by God does not have its promise voided by the law which came four hundred and thirty years later.
\v 18 For if the inheritance is of the law it is no more of promise, but God has given it to Abraham by promise.
