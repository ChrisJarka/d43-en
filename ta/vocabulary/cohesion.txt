Cohesion in writing helps draw a reader further along in the text. Its purpose is to keep the attention of the reader and increase understanding of how sentences relate to one another and the topic overall. Words and phrases that join sentences are common tools for increasing cohesion. Simple joining of sentences is typically done with a conjunction (e.g. and, but, or). Sequencing or time order is another method and includes such words as: next, then, first and second. Providing visual cues with location words also helps readers move through passages. Cause and effect (i.e. consequently, therefore), comparison and contrast (i.e. in the same manner, instead) and conclusion (i.e. in summary, accordingly) are other typical ways cohesion appears.

An expanded list of such words is given below. Using the concept of transition words as you translate will build cohesion in the completed project.

CONJUNCTIONS: and, but, or, for, nor, yet, so, if only, then, since, whenever, while, unless, because

TRANSITION WORDS: specifically, chiefly, in the beginning, following, in conclusion, to summarize, as a result, moreover
