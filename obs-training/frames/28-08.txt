{{:en:obs:obs-28-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:obe:kt:jesus|Jesus]]** looked at the **[[:en:obe:kt:disciple|disciples]]** and said, “**With people this is impossible**, but **with [[:en:obe:kt:god|God]], all things are possible**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **With people this is impossible** - That is, “It is not possible for people to do this” or, “Mere humans cannot save themselves.”
  * **with God, all things are possible** - This could also be translated as, “God is able to do anything, even save a rich person” or, “God is able to do impossible things, so he can save even a rich person.”
