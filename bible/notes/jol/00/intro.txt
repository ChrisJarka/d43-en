===What is Joel about?===

The major theme of Joel is the “day of Yahweh. This expression is found five times in Joel (1:15; 2:1; 11, 21; and 3:14); this phrase is also found in thirteen places in Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos, Obadiah, Zephaniah, and Malachi. This “day” is about the day of reckoning between Yahweh and his people, both in the current time of Joel and in the future, as well as the judgment of the nations. The day comes when Yahweh personally responds in judgment to the rebellions and sins of his people and of all the nations.

===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Joel" may also be called the "The book about Joel" or "The sayings of Joel."
