\v 6 Later the high priests found the coins. They picked them up and said, "This is money that we paid to have a man killed, and our law does not allow us to put such money into the Temple treasury."
\v 7 So they decided to use that money to buy a field that belonged to a potter. They made that field a place where they buried strangers who died in Jerusalem.
\v 8 That is why that place is still called "The field of blood."

\v 6 The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, "It is not lawful to put this into the treasury, because it is the
price of blood."
\v 7 And they counseled together and with the money bought the Potterâ€™s Field to bury strangers in.
\v 8 For this reason that field has been called, "The field of blood" to this day.
