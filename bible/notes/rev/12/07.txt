\v 7 Then there was a battle in heaven. Michael and the angels that he commanded fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back against Michael and his angels.
\v 8 But the dragon did not win the battle, and neither did God allow the dragon and his angels to stay in heaven any longer.
\v 9 Instead, God threw the huge dragon out  of heaven. The dragon is the ancient serpent, the one whose names are the Devil and Satan. He is the one who deceives people all over the earth. He was thrown to the earth along with all his angels.
