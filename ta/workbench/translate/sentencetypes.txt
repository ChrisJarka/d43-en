//This answers the question:// //What are the different types of sentences?//



==== Sentence Types ====

A **sentence** is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. The basic types of sentences are:
  * **Declarative Sentence** or **Statement**. They are usually used to give information. '//This is a fact.//'
  * **Interrogative Sentence ** or **Question** - These are usually used to ask for information. '//Do you know him?//'
  * **Exclamatory Sentence or Exclamation** - These are usually used to express a strong feeling. 'Ouch, that hurt!'
  * **Imperative Sentence**  or **Command** - These are usually used to make something happen. '//Pick that up.//'
  * **Performative**

In some languages some of  these sentence types can be used for some of the purposes of the other types. For example, in some languages questions can also be used to as a statement or an exclamation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
