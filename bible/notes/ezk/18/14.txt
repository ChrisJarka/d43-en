  * **committed** - "done"
  * **fears God** - The “fear of God” is something that people feel when they know that God is perfectly holy and hates sin. This fear motivates people to obey God and to hate all forms of evil.
  * **and does not lift his eyes to the idols** - The phrase "lift his eyes" refers to looking up.  AT: “and does not look to idols for help” (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
