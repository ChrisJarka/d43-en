<usfm>
\v 12 Horses certainly do not run on big rocks,
\q2 and certainly people cannot plow the rocks with oxen.
\q1 But you have done things that no one should do:
\q1 You have distorted what is fair;
\q2 you have changed what is right and consider it to be like things that are bitter.
\q1
\v 13 You are proud because you have captured the town of Lo Debar,
\q2 and you have said, "We captured Karnaim by our own power!"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 12 Do horses run on the rocky cliffs?
\q Does one plow there with oxen?
\q Yet you have turned justice into poison
\q and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness.
\q
\v 13 You who rejoice over Lo Debar,
\q who say, "Have we not taken Karnaim by our own strength?"
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Amos uses two rhetorical questions to draw attention to the rebuke that follows.

  * **Do horses run on the rocky cliffs?** - It is impossible for a horse to run on rocky cliffs without getting hurt. Amos uses this rhetorical question to rebuke them for their actions. AT: "Horses do not run on rocky cliffs." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Does one plow there with oxen?** - One does not plow on rocky ground. Amos uses this rhetorical question to rebuke them for their actions. AT: "A person does not plow with oxen on rocky ground." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Yet you have turned justice into poison** - Distorting what is just is spoken of as if the leaders "turned justice into poison." AT: "Yet you distort what is just" or "But you make laws that hurt innocent people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the fruit of righteousness into bitterness** - This means basically the same thing as the first part of the sentence. Distorting what is right is spoken of as if righteousness were a sweet fruit that the people made bitter tasting. AT: "you distort what is right" or "you punish those who do what is right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Lo Debar ... Karnaim** - These are names of towns. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Have we not taken Karnaim by our own strength?** - The people use a question to emphasize that they believe they captured a city because of their own power. AT: "We captured Karnaim by our own power!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
