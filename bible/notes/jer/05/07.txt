<usfm>
\q
\v 7 Why should I pardon these people?
\q Your sons have abandoned me and have made oaths by what are not gods.
\q I fed them fully, but they committed adultery and took on the marks of a house of prostitution.
\q
\v 8 They were horses in heat. They roamed about wanting to have sex. Each man neighed to his neighbor's wife.
\q
\v 9 So should I not punish them? This is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q Should my heart not avenge itself on a nation that is like this?
