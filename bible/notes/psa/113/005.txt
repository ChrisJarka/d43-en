===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Who is like Yahweh...**  - This question emphasizes that there is no one else like Yahweh. AT: "There is no one like Yahweh..." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **who has his seat on high** - "who is very great" or "who has very great authority." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **looks down at the sky and at the earth** - "looks down to examine the sky and the earth" or "looks down in order to see the sky and they earth." Even though Yahweh is higher and greater than the sky and the earth, he still pays attention to what happens in those places.
