====== leaven ======

===== Definition: =====

Leaven is a substance used in bread to make the dough rise, and is used in the Bible metaphorically of sin.

  * Metaphorically leaven is like sin because sin spreads through a person's life in the same way leaven spreads throughout dough.
  * The tribes of Israel were commanded to make bread without leaven to remind them of when they left Egypt in haste.
