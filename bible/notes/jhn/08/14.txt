\v 14 Jesus replied, "Even if I were the \add only one to\add* say these things about myself, what I say is true, because I know that I came from \add heaven\add*, and I know that I am going \add back to heaven\add*. But \bd you\bd* do not know where I came from or where I am going.
\v 15 \bd You\bd* judge people according to human standards. \add The reason\add* that \bd I\bd* am \add here is\add* not to condemn people\f + \ft Or: to say that I will punish people \f* \add for their sins\add*.
\v 16 But if I did judge \add people\add*, what I decided would be correct, because I am not the \add only\add* one \add who will decide those things\add*. I and the one who sent me will both decide.

\v 14 Jesus replied, "Even if I were the only one to say these things about myself, what I say is true because I know where I came from and I know where I am going. Nevertheless, you do not know where I came from and you do not know where I am going.
\v 15 You judge people according to human standards and the laws of men. I have not come at this time to judge anyone.
\v 16 When I do judge, it will be right and just because I am not the only one who will bring justice. I and the Father who sent me, we will execute justice together.

\v 14 Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I bear witness about myself, my witness is true. I know from where I came and
where I am going, but you do not know from where I came or where I am going.
\v 15 You judge after the flesh; I judge no one.
\v 16 Yet if I judge, my judgment is true because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me is with me.
