\v 5 Make models that represent the rats and the tumors that are ruining your land. Make them in order to honor the god of the Israelite people. If you do that, perhaps Yahweh will stop punishing you, your gods, and your land.
\v 6 Do not be stubborn like Pahraoh and the Egyptians were. Remember that Yahweh finally made them suffer more than they could bear, and that they finally allowed the Israelites to leave their land.

<usfm>
\v 5 So you must make models of your tumors, and models of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you, from your gods, and from your land.
\v 6 Why should you harden your hearts, like the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he dealt severely with them, and he did they not allow the people to leave, but then they left?
