====== Structure of the Bible ======

The Bible is made up of 66 books and letters. It has two main parts. The first part was written first and is called the Old Testament. The second part was written later and is called the New Testament.

The Old Testament has 39 books and the New Testament has 27 books and letters. 

Each book is divided up into chapters. Most books have more than one chapter, but Philemon, 2 John, 3 John, and Jude each have only one chapter.

All the chapters are divided up into verses. 

When we want to refer to a particular verse, we first write the name of the book, then the chapter, and then the verse. For example John 3:16 means John, chapter 3, verse 16.

When we refer to multiple verses, we put a line between them.
John 3:16-18 means John, chapter 3, verses 16, 17, and 18.

In translation Academy we tell where portions of scripture come from. However, this does not mean that the whole verse or set of verse is shown. The text below comes from Judges chapter 6, verse 28, but it is not the whole verse. The verse has more at the end.

   * **In the morning when the men of the town got up, the altar of Baal was broken down** (Judges 6:28)
