\v 13 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind
them.
\v 14 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to Jehovah, and the priests
sounded with the trumpets.
\v 15 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God struck Jeroboam and all
Israel before Abijah and Judah.
