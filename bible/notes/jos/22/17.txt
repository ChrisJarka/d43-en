<usfm>
\v 17 Have you forgotten what happened at Peor, \add when some Israelites sinned by worshiping the god that the Moab people-group worship\add*? Many Israelites became very sick and died because of that sin, and we are still suffering because of their sin.
\v 18 Are you now turning away from obeying Yahweh and refusing to do what he wants? If you do not stop right now rebelling against Yahweh today, he will be angry with all of us Israelites tomorrow.'

\v 17 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came a
plague upon the congregation of Jehovah,
\v 18 that you must turn away this day from following Jehovah? and it will be, seeing you rebel today against Jehovah, that
to-morrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
