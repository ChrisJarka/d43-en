\v 13 A young man who is poor but wise is a better person than a foolish old king who refuses to pay attention when people try to give him good advice.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 It is better to be a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to listen to warnings.
\v 14 This is true even if the young man becomes king from prison, or even if he was born poor in his kingdom.
