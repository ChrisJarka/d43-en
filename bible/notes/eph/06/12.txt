\v 12 You must do this because the fighting that we \add believers\add* do is not only against human beings \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. Instead, we are also fighting against evil spirits who rule and have authority over all that is evil \f + \ft metaphor \f* in the world. We are fighting against evil spirits who are in heavenly places \f + \ft Or: everywhere \f*.
\v 13 Therefore, \add just like a soldier\add* puts on all his armor\f + \ft Or: things to help him fight \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add use well all the spiritual resources, Or: helps that God provides for you\add*. Do that in order that you may be able to resist successfully the devil and all his powerful evil spirits \f + \ft metonymy \f* every time they attack you\f + \ft Or: tempt you to sin or cause something bad to happen to you \f*. \add Do it also in order that\add* when you have done all that you can to resist them \add when they attack you\add*, you will still be ready to resist them \add when they attack you the next time\add*.

\v 12 You must do this because the fighting that we believers do is not only against human beings .
\v 13 Therefore, just like a soldier puts on all his armor. Do it also in order that when you have done all that you can to resist them when they attack you, you will still be ready to resist them when they attack you the next time.

\v 12 For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.
\v 13 Wherefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.
