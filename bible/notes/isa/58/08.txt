===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

    * **Then your light would be broken open like the sunrise** - This means that if they start helping other people, their deeds will be wonderful and a cause for celebration like when the light comes after a dark night. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **and your healing would quickly sprout up** - This means God will bless and restore them as quickly as a flower starts to grow.
    * **your righteousness would go before you, and the glory of Yahweh would be your rearguard** - This refers to the time when God protected the people of Israel as they escaped from Egypt. This means God will again protect them from their enemies if they will do what is right. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
