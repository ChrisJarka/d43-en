\v 54 He also said to the crowds, "When you see a dark cloud forming in the west, you immediately say 'It is going to rain!' and that is what happens.
\v 55 When the wind blows from the south, you say, 'It is going to be a very hot day!' and you are right.
\v 56 You hypocrites! By observing the clouds and the wind, you are able to discern what is happening regarding the weather. Why are you not able to discern what God is doing at this present time!

\v 54 And he said to the multitudes also, When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, There comes a shower and so it comes to pass.
\v 55 And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, There will be a scorching heat; and it comes to pass.
\v 56 You hypocrites, you know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven; but how is it that you know not how to interpret this time?
