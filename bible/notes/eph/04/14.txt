\v 14 Then we will no longer be \add spiritually immature\add*, like \f + \ft metaphor \f* little children \add are immature\add*. We will no longer be constantly \add changing what we believe, like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* waves of the sea are \add constantly changing as the wind blows and\add* tosses them back and forth. We will not allow people who teach \add what is false\add* and who scheme\f + \ft Or: try cleverly \f* to deceive, Or: influence us.
\v 15 Instead, by loving \add others\add* as we behave according to \add God's\add* truth \f + \ft Or: speak in a loving manner what is true \f*, we will become more and more like Christ in every way. He is the one \add who controls\f + \ft Or: guides \f* all his people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like a person's\add* head \add controls\f + \ft Or: guides \f* his\add* body.
\v 16 He \add enables all those who belong to him to mature spiritually. Specifically, they will become mature spiritually\add* by loving each other and by each of them doing the work \add that God wants them to do. That is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a person's body \add grows stronger, as\add* each part of the body is joined to the others by the ligaments and as each part functions properly\f + \ft Or: works as it should \f*.

\v 14 Then we will no longer be immature believers, like little children are immature. We will no longer follow every new teaching, like a boat is blown around by the wind and waves. We will not allow people who teach what is false to trick us and deceive us.
\v 15 Instead, we will live by loving God and trusting his true teachings, and we will become more and more like Christ in every way. He controls his people like a person's head controls his body.
\v 16 He enables his worldwide body of believers to grow together and love each other, like a person's body fits together and holds together by the joints that connect the body together, which allows the body to grow and build itself up because the parts of body depend upon each other.

\v 14 Then we should no longer be like children, tossed around and carried away with every wind of teaching,like a boat in the wind,  by the trickery of people who scheme to deceive us. 
\v 15 Rather we will speak the truth in love so that we may grow up in all things into him who is the head of all believers, who is Christ,
\v 16 from whom all the body of believers fits together and is connected together by the work provided by each joint, which makes the whole body grow itself and build itself up in love.
