\v 1 Now in the assembly in Antioch, there were some prophets and teachers. They were Barnabas, Symeon (called Niger), Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch), and Saul.
\v 2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, to do the work to which I have called them."
\v 3 After the assembly had fasted, prayed, and laid their hands on these men, they sent them off.

  * **Symeon ... Manaen** - (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **foster brother of Herod** - Manaen was probably Herod's playmate or close friend growing up.
  * **While** - This word is used to mark two events that are happening at the same time.
