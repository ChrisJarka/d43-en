\v 9 At another moment, I may proclaim something about a nation or a kingdom, that I will build it up or plant it.
\v 10 But if it does evil in my eyes by not listening to my voice, then I will stop the good that I had said I would do for them.

===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:other:voice]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:good]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **build it up or plant it** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Yahweh speaks of strengthening kingdoms as if they were buildings that he would build, and as if they were plants that he would plant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **if it does evil in my eyes** - Here the word "it" refers to a nation or kingdom, which is a metonym for the people in that nation or kingdom. The word "eyes" represents seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. AT: "if the people of that nation do things that I consider to be evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **not listening to my voice** - Here the word "voice" represents the words that Yahweh speaks. Here, "not listening" is an idiom that means that they do not obey. AT: "not obeying what I say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
