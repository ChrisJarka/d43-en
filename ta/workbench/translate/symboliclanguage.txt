Symbolic language is 
 
===== Description =====
Symbolic language is 

Possible definitions: \\ 
Symbolism in writing is the use of symbols to represent abstract ideas. The symbols may be living things, non-living things, or actions. Symbolism in the Bible occurs most in prophecy and poetry, especially prophecy that tells about things that will happen in the future. 
 
We are using the word "symbolism" in the Bible to refer to things that God showed people in dreams and visions that represented other things. The symbol could be a living thing, a non-living thing, or an action. The symbols often represented events that had happened or that would happen. 

  * Eat this scroll, then go speak to the house of Israel. (Ezekiel 3:1) - Eating the scroll is a symbol of reading and understanding well what was written on the scroll.  
 
One purpose of symbolism is to tell some people something that they would be able to understand while hiding the meaning from others. Another purpose of symbolism is to help people understand the greatness or severity of some event by calling another.  
 
**Reason this is a translation issue:** People who read the Bible today may find it hard to recognize that the language is symbolic, and they may not know what the symbol stands for. 
 
**Translation Principle:** When symbolic language is used, it is important to keep the symbol in the translation.  



===== Examples from the Bible=====

  * **After this I saw in my dream at night __a fourth animal__, terrifying, frightening, and very strong. It had __large iron teeth__; it devoured, broke in pieces, and trampled underfoot what was left. It was different from the other animals, and it had __ten horns__.** (Daniel 7:7) 
    * This animals in this verse represent kingdoms, iron teeth represent a powerful army, and the horns represent powerful leaders. 
 
  * **I have placed a yoke of iron on the neck of all of these nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him.**  (Jeremiah 28:14)
 
 
  * **I turned around to see whose voice was speaking to me, and as I turned I saw __seven golden lampstands__. In the middle of the lampstands there was one like a Son of Man,  â€¦   He had in his right hand __seven stars__, and coming out of his mouth was __a sharp two-edged sword__.... As for the hidden meaning about the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: __the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches__, and __the seven lampstands are the seven churches__."** (Revelation 12, 16, 20) \\   
    * This passage explains the meaning of the seven lampstands and the seven starts. The two-edged sword represents God's word and judgment.

===== Translation Strategies =====

If people would not understand the symbol in the text, here are some strategies for dealing with it.

  - Let the pastors explain it. 
  - Explain the symbol in a footnote. (This allows for telling more than one possible meaning.) 
  - Explain the symbol in the text. 



===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Let the pastors explain it.
  * **After this I saw in my dream at night a fourth animal, terrifying, frightening, and very strong. It had large iron teeth; it devoured, broke in pieces, and trampled underfoot what was left. It was different from the other animals, and it had ten horns.**  (Daniel 7:7)
 
2. Explain the symbol in a footnote: Write footnotes saying something like these: 
  * "The animal is a symbol for a kingdom." 
  * "The iron teeth is a symbol for the kingdom's powerful army."
  * "The horns are a symbol of power, and probably refer to powerful kings." 
  * 
3. Explain the symbol in the text. 
  "After this I saw in my dream at night __a fourth animal representing a fourth kingdom__. It was terrifying, frightening, and very strong. __It had large iron teeth. These represent its powerful army__; it devoured, broke in pieces, and trampled underfoot what was left. It was different from the other animals, and it had __ten horns, which represent ten kings__.
