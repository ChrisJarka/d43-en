====== Titus 01:15-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 \add Believers should reject\add* what they teach about food\add , because\add* no \add food that we eat\add* can make us unacceptable to God if we are pure \add in our\add* \add inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts\add* \f*. But if people are evil \add within themselves\add* and they do not trust \add in Christ Jesus\add*, there is no \add ritual\add* that can make them acceptable to God. Such people's way of thinking has been ruined \f + \ft Or:Such people have ruined their way of thinking \f*, and they do not even feel guilty \add when they do what is evil\add*.
\v 16 Even though they claim\f + \ft Or: say \f* that they know God, by what they do they \add show that they\add* do not know God\f + \ft Or: his true teaching \f*. They do not obey \add God\add*, and they are unable to do anything that he considers to be good\add . So God considers them to be absolutely\add* disgusting!

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 If someone does not have sinful thoughts or desires, then he views all things as good. But if anyone is wicked and does not believe in Christ Jesus, everything makes him unclean. These people think in dirty ways, and they decide to act in evil ways.
\v 16 Even though they claim to know God, what they do shows that they do not know him. Other people find them disgusting. They disobey God and can do nothing good for him.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 To those who are pure, all is pure, but to those who are polluted and unbelieving, nothing is pure, for their minds and consciences have been corrupted. 
\v 16 They profess to know God, but what they do denies him. They are detestable and disobedient and prove to be unfit for any good work.
