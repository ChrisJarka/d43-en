====== leprosy, Leper ======


===== Definition: =====


Leprosy was a serious communicable disease in Bible times.  There was no cure so people with the disease had to be isolated outside the encampment or town.  The disease discolored the skin and produced numbness due to death of nerve tissue and rotting of fingers and toes.  Today it is known as Hansen's Disease and is curable.
