\v 14 And listen not to the words of the prophets that speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon; for
they prophesy a lie to you.
\v 15 For I have not sent them, says Jehovah, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that you may
perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy to you.
