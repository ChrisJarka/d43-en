\c 11
\p
\v 1 I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of
Benjamin.
\v 2 God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know you not what the scripture says of Elijah? how he pleadeth with
God against Israel:
\v 3 Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have digged down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
\v 4 But what says the answer of God to him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
\v 5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
\v 6 But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.
\v 7 What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:
\v 8 according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not
hear, to this very day.
\v 9 And David saith,
\q Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
\q And a stumblingblock, and a recompense to them:
\q
\v 10 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see,
\q And bow you down their back always.
\p
\v 11 I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation
is come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
\v 12 Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
\v 13 But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;
\v 14 if by any means I may provoke to jealousy them that are my flesh, and may save some of them.
\v 15 For if the casting away of them is the reconciling of the world, what
shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
\v 16 And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
\v 17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, was grafted in among them, and did become
partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;
\v 18 glory not over the branches: but if you gloriest, it is not you that bear the root, but the root thee.
\v 19 You will say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
\v 20 Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
\v 21 for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.
\v 22 Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God’s goodness, if you
continue in his goodness: otherwise you also shall be cut off.
\v 23 And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
\v 24 For if you was cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and was grafted contrary to nature into a good
olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
\p
\v 25 For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest you be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in
part has befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;
\v 26 and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written,
\q There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer;
\q He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
\q
\v 27 And this is my covenant to them,
\q When I shall take away their sins.
\m
\v 28 As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’
sake.
\v 29 For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.
\v 30 For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,
\v 31 even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.
\v 32 For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.
\p
\v 33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways
past tracing out!
\v 34 For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been his counsellor?
\v 35 or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?
\v 36 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him
be the glory for ever. Amen.
