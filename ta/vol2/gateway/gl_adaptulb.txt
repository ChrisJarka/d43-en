===== Adapt the ULB =====

This module answers the question: What are the guidelines for adapting an existing translation as the ULB?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol2:gateway:gl_udb|Translating the UDB]]
  * [[en:ta:vol2:gateway:gl_translate|Translating in the Gateways]]

In order to adapt an existing translation and use it as the ULB for a Gateway Language, it is necessary that it be a literal translation. That is, it should follow the same order of clauses as the original biblical languages and reproduce the original biblical idioms and figures of speech. Most Bibles that were translated into Gateway Languages in the first half of the twentieth century or earlier are literal translations. 

It is also necessary that the Bible that you adapt as the ULB not be encumbered by copyright. That means that it must be in the public domain or have a license that permits us to reproduce and translate it. For more information on copyrights and licensing, see ta-open_license.

If the Bible is very old, you will need to update the language and the style so that it uses words that people use now and "talks" in the way that people do now. Even though it has a literal style, the ULB must use words that people know so that they can understand it.

After you update the text, you will need to adapt the Notes so that they refer to the right parts of the updated Bible. See ta-gl_Notes.
