\v 4 One day a very large crowd was gathering, because people were traveling to see Jesus from many different towns. Then he told them this story:
\v 5 "A man went out to his field to plant some grain seeds. As he was scattering them over the soil, some of the seeds fell on the hard pathway. Then people walked on those seeds, and birds ate them.
\v 6 Some of the seeds fell on rocky ground which had very little soil. Therefore, as soon as the seeds grew, the plants dried up because there was no moisture.

\v 4 Now, when a large crowd of people had gathered together, including people who were coming to him from many different cities , he  spoke to them using a parable:
\v 5 "A sower went out to sow some seeds. And as he sowed, some of the seeds fell by the wayside and they were trampled underfoot, and the birds of the sky devoured them.
\v 6 Other seeds fell on rocky soil and as soon as they grew into plants, they withered away, because they had no moisture.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **sower went out to sow some seeds - **  You may also say, "A farmer went out to plant." However, it is important to the parable that you clarify the thing being planted is seeds, planted by scattering them over the area in which they should grow. Nothing was individually placed.
    * **wayside**  - You may also say, "Some fell by the footpath." This would have been an area of trampled dirt, if not a packed road.
