\v 31 In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get you out, and go elsewhere: for Herod would certainly kill you.
\v 32 And he said to them, Go and say to that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and to-morrow, and the third day I am finished.
\v 33 Nevertheless I must go on my way today and to-morrow and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
