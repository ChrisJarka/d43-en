=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

**Love**

Love is the most important characteristic of the believer. This chapter gives a full description of love and why love is more important than the gifts of the Spirit. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

**Metaphor**

This chapter has three [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]s: Without love the ability to speak in many languages of earth and heaven is as meaningless as a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
Like children maturing leave the ideas of childhood so we will leave the special gifts.
Like a metal mirror that only partially show the image so we only partially understand -what God is like. Some day we will know him completely.
