===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information**: Jeremiah often wrote prophecy in the form of poetry. Hebrew poetry uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **a wind of destruction** - 1) AT: "a wind that destroys" or 2) "the spirit of a destroyer"
  * **Leb Kamai** - This is another word for Babylon.
  * **scatter her and devastate her land ... they will come against her** - The word "her," a metaphor that refers to Babylon as if it were a woman, is a metonym for the people who live in Babylon. AT: "separate the people who live there from each other, send them in different directions, and make their land empty ... foreigners will attack the people of Babylon" 
  * **on the day of disaster** - The phrase "day of" is a Hebrew idiom for "when." AT: "when I destroy Babylon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
