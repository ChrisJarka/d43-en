\v 1 And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
\v 2 Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.
\v 3 His brethren therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that your disciples also may behold your works which
you doest.
\v 4 For no man does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, manifest yourself
to the world.
\v 5 For even his brethren did not believe on him.
\v 6 Jesus therefore says to them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.
\v 7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.
\v 8 Go you up to the feast: I go not up to this feast; because my time is not yout fulfilled.
\v 9 And having said these things to them, he abode still in Galilee.
\p
\v 10 But when his brethren were gone up to the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.
\v 11 The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
\v 12 And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but
he leads the multitude astray.
\v 13 Yet no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.
\p
\v 14 But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
\v 15 The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?
\v 16 Jesus therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.
\v 17 If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or
whether I speak from myself.
\v 18 He that speaks from himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks the glory of him that sent him, the same is
true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
\v 19 Did not Moses give you the law, and yout none of you does the law? Why seek you to kill me?
\v 20 The multitude answered, You have a demon: who seeks to kill thee?
\v 21 Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and you all marvel because thereof.
\v 22 Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath you circumcise a man.
\v 23 If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you angry with me, because I
made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?
\v 24 Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
\p
\v 25 Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
\v 26 And lo, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?
\v 27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knows whence he is.
\v 28 Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, You both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of
myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.
\v 29 I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.
\v 30 They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.
\v 31 But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those
which this man has done?
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent
officers to take him.
\v 33 Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go to him that sent me.
\v 34 You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, you cannot come.
\v 35 The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go to the
Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
\v 36 What is this word that he said, You shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you cannot come?
\p
\v 37 Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come
to me and drink.
\v 38 He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.
\v 39 But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet
given; because Jesus was not yet glorified.
\v 40 Some of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.
\v 41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?
\v 42 Hath not the scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?
\v 43 So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.
\v 44 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
\p
\v 45 The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why did you not bring him?
\v 46 The officers answered, Never man so spake.
\v 47 The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are you also led astray?
\v 48 Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?
\v 49 But this multitude that knows not the law are accursed.
\v 50 Nicodemus says to them (he that came to him before, being one of them),
\v 51 Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?
\v 52 They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee arises no prophet.
