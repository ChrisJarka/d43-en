\c 11
\p
\v 1 And Jehovah said to Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go
hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
\v 2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels
of silver, and jewels of gold.
\v 3 And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of
Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.
\p
\v 4 And Moses said, Thus says Jehovah, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:
\v 5 and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sits upon his throne, even
to the firstborn of the female servant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of cattle.
\v 6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor shall be any more.
\v 7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that you may know how that
Jehovah does make a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.
\v 8 And all these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Get you out, and all the
people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
\p
\v 9 And Jehovah said to Moses, Pharaoh will not listen to you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the
children of Israel go out of his land.
