====== Aram, Aramean ======

===== Definition: =====

"Aram" is the name of a region where Abraham's relatives lived. They became known as "Arameans" and spoke the Aramaic language.

    * One of Shem's sons was named Aram. Another man named Aram was a cousin of Rebekah. It is probable that the region of Aram was named after one of these two men.
