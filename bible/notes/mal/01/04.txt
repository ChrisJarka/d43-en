\v 4 If Edom says, "We are beaten down, but we will rebuild the ruins," Yahweh of hosts will says, "They
may rebuild, but I will throw down again. Others will call them 'The country of wickedness' and 'The people whom Yahweh has cursed forever.'"
\v 5 Your own eyes will see this, and you will say, "Yahweh is great beyond the borders of Israel."
