\v 13 Some of the Pharisees took the man who was previously blind to a gathering of the Pharisee group.
\v 14 It is worth noticing that it was on the Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and then opened his eyes so he could see.
\v 15 So the Pharisees asked him again about how he was now able to see?" He said to them, "The man put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I see."
