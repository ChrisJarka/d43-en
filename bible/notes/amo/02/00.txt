====== Amos 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter consists of oracles against Moab and Judah by using poetic language and imagery. But the UDB translates it using prose. If your language can support translating this chapter into poetry please do. But otherwise, use prose. 

== Judah ==

In contrast, Moab is only given two verses whereas Judah is written about for the rest of the chapter. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

You will notice that the phrase ""For three sins of Judah, even for four," is used to begin each of these oracles. This is not a literal count but more showing a large number of sins. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

As with other names like Moab, please review [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]
