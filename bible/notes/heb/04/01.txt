\v 1 \add The Israelites did not enter the place where they would rest\add*. But \add God\add* has still promised us that we can enter the place of resting \add in heaven eternally\add*. So we must beware \add of the possibility\add* that \add God\add* may consider that some of you have failed to enter the \add place of\add* resting \add eternally as the Israelites did not enter the place where they would rest\add*.
\v 2 We have heard the message\add about Christ\add*, just like \add the Israelites\add* heard \add what God promised\add*. But \add just like\add* the message did not benefit \add most of\add* those who heard it because they did not believe it as \add Joshua and Caleb did, it\add* will not\add benefit us eternally if we do not keep believing it\add*.

\v 1 Many Israelites did not enter the place where they would find God's rest. But God did promise them rest, and he has also promised us his rest now and also forever in heaven. But we must beware that we can miss God's place of rest just like many of the Israelites missed it.
\v 2 We have heard the Good News about how Jesus gives us God's rest, just like the Israelites heard about God's promise of rest. But just like the message of God's rest did not benefit many Israelites because they did not trust God as Joshua and Caleb did, the Good News about Christ will also not benefit us if we do not receive it by trusting God to give us his rest now, and forever in heaven.

\v 1 Therefore, we must be very careful unless the continuing promise to enter into God's rest might seem to have failed to reach some of you,
\v 2 For we have had the good news about God's rest proclaimed to us just as the Israelites did, but hearing that word did not benefit those who heard it without receiving it by faith.
