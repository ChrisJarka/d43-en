\v 6 Then the Lord [Jesus] said, "did you hear what the unjust judge said?"[Even though the judge was not a righteous man, think carefully about what he said!]
\v 7 Will not God do justice also[Similarly, God will certainly show that what you have done has been right! He will do this] for you whom he has chosen, [He will do this for you] who cry out/pray earnestly/ to him night and day? Will not God be compassionate to those who pray like that?[, asking him to help you. He may delay helping you.]
\v 8 [But] I tell you, God will quickly do justice for His chosen ones![some day he will show that what you did was right, and he will do it quickly.] But when the Promised One/Son of Man? comes, will He find this belief in the land? [I, the one who came from heaven, return to earth, there may not be many people who will still be trusting that I will vindicate them "]

\v 7 And will not God avenge his elect, that cry to him day and night, and  yet he is patient with them?
\v 8 I say to you, that he will bring justice to them speedily. But when the Son of man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"
