\v 22 On the other hand, some women from our group amazed us. Early this morning they went to the tomb,
\v 23 but Jesus' body was not there! They came \add back\add* and said that they had seen some angels in a vision. The angels said that he was alive!

\v 22 Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;
\v 23 and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
\v 24 And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not."
