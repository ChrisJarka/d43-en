\v 12 I will tell you this: On the \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add final\add* day when \add God judges everyone\add*, he will punish the wicked people \f + \ft metonymy \f* who long ago lived in Sodom, \add the city that he destroyed because its people were so wicked\add*.

\v 10 But if you enter a town whose people do not welcome you, go into its main streets and say,
\v 11 'As a warning against you, we will wipe off even the dust that sticks to our feet as we are leaving your town. Yet be sure of this; the Kingdom of God is near.'
\v 12 I tell you that on the final day when God judges everyone, the people of that town will be punished even more severely than the wicked people who lived long ago in the city of Sodom!

\v 10 But into whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,
\v 11 'Even the dust from your city that clings to our feet, we wipe off against you! But know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn near.' 
\v 12 I say to you that on the judgment day it will be more tolerable for Sodom, than for that city.
