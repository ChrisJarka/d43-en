\p
\v 15 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that their plans were known to us, and God had frustrated their plans, all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work.
\v 16 And so from that time, half of my servants worked only on rebuilding the wall, and half of them held spears, shields, bows, and the coats of mail. And the leaders stood behind all the people of Judah.
