\v 4 Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.
\v 5 Then I will draw near to you for judgment. I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers,
and against the false witnesses, and against those that oppress the hired worker in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and
that turn aside the sojourner from his right, and do not fear me, says Yahweh of armies.
