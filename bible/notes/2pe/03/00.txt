====== 2 Peter 03 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Fire ==
Fire is associated with destruction and because of this it is associated with punishment.

== Day of the Lord ==
The exact time of the coming [[:en:obe:kt:dayofthelord|Day of the Lord]] will come as a surprise to the world. This is what the [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] "like a thief in the night" means. Because of this Christians are to be prepared for the coming of the Lord.
