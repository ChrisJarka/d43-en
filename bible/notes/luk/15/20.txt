===== Translation Notes: =====


    * Jesus continues his story
    * **and he left and came towards his father**  - or, "he left and started home", or "he left and started going back to his father"
    * **bold words**  - explanation
    * **moved with compassion**  - literally means feeling pity, sympathy, or love. It comes from the word for the bowels or inner parts of the body. In the Greek world, the bowels were the seat of the emotion and the source of love. The father's response is an emotional one that comes from the depths of who he is. He sees his son and loves him.  He was moved from the heart.
