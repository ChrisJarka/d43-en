===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 He waits in ambush near the villages;
\q In the secret places he murders the innocent;
\q His eyes look for some helpless victim.
\q
\v 9 He lurks in secret like  a lion in the thicket;
\q He lies in wait to catch the oppressed:
\q He does catch the oppressed, when he pulls  in his net.
\q
\v 10 His victims are crushed and beaten down,
\q They  fall into his sturdy nets..
</usfm>
