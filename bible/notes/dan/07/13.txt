\v 13 I saw in the visions at night, 
\q and I saw with the clouds of heaven, one came like a son of man,

\v 14 And there was given him authority to rule, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His authority to rule is an everlasting authority, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom is one that shall never be destroyed.
