<usfm>
\q
\v 4 Their line is gone out through all the earth,
\q And their words to the end of the world.
\q In them has he set a tent for the sun,
\q
\v 5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
\q And rejoices as a strong man to run his course.
\q
\v 6 His going forth is from the end of the heavens,
\q And his circuit to the ends of it;
\q And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
\b
