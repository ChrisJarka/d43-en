\v 31 I also arranged for people to bring the firewood \add that was needed to burn on the altar\add*, as \add Moses had declared\add* that we should do. I also arranged for the people to bring the first part of what they harvested \add each year\add*.
\p My God, do not forget that I \add have done all these things\add*, and bless me for doing them.
