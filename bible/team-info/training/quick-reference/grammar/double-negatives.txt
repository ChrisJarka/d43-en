====== Double Negatives ======


===== Description =====

Most languages express the negative near the verb. Some languages can also express negative in a pronoun like “none,” “nothing,” and “no one,” or an adverb like “nowhere.” In English the following pairs of sentences mean the same thing. “I do __not__ have any” – “I have __none__”. “I do __not__ want anything” – “I want __nothing__”.
