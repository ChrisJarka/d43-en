=== Gen:22:17 ===

"I will surely bless you and I will greatly multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and your descendants will possess the gate of their enemies."

  * **(1) as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore**  - **(3)** God compares Abrahams descendants to the stars and the sand. Just as people cannot count the huge number of stars or the grains of sand, so there will be so many of Abraham's descendants that people will not be able to count them. **(4)** This could be translated as "beyond what you can count." **(5)** (See: Simile)

=== Luk:22:44 ===

"Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground."

  * **(1) his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground**  - **(3)** The drops of sweat that were falling from Jesus' forehead were described as similar in appearance to large drops of blood. This image gives the impression of great suffering. **(5)** (See: Simile)

=== Act:02:2 ===

"Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting."

  * **(1) like the rush of a violent wind**  - **(2)** "like the blowing of a very strong wind" or "like a very strong wind blowing." **(3)** The sound was difficult to describe, but it was similar to the loud noise made by a violent wind. **(5)** (See: Simile)
