===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 I want you to know that there will soon be a time when people will say, 'Women \f + \ft synecdoche \f* who have never borne children or nursed babies are fortunate!'
\v 30 Then, \add in order that they will not have to suffer greatly when their enemies destroy this city\add*, people who are left in the city will say to the mountains, 'Fall down on us!' And people will say to the hills, 'Cover us!'
\v 31 \add I am innocent\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add I am like\add* a living tree \add that people do not try to burn. But the people of Jerusalem deserve that their enemies punish them. They are like\add* dry wood that is ready to \add burn\add*. So if they \add nail me to the cross\add*, \add their enemies\add* will certainly do much worse things to them!\f + \ft Or: what worse things will God do to them? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

\v 29 For I want you to know that there will soon be a time when people will say, 'How fortunate are the women who have never given birth to children or nursed babies!'
\v 30 Then,the people in this city will say, 'We wish that the mountains would fall on top of us and that the hills would cover us up!'
\v 31 If I have to die, even though I have nothing wrong, terrible things will certainly happen to people who deserve to die.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that did not bear, and the breasts that did not nurse.'
\v 30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.'
\v 31 For if they do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For behold** - "I want you to know" (UDB)
  * **in which** - "when"
  * **they will say** - "people will say"
  * **the barren** - "women who have not borne children"
  * **Then** - "at that time"
  * **and to the hills** - "and they will say to the hills"
  * **For if they do these things while the tree is green what will happen when it is dry?** - This rhetorical question (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]]) can be restructured as a statement: "They are doing bad things to a [valuable] green tree, so you can be sure that bad things will happen to [useless] dry wood." Jesus is using the green tree as a metaphor (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]]) for himself and dry wood as a metaphor for those who were about to kill him. "You see that they crucify me (Jesus) when I have done nothing to deserve punishment, so you can be sure that God will punish people who are sinners much more severely."
  * **For if they do these things while the tree is green** - This metaphor compares Jesus to a tree that will not burn because it is green.  
  * **what will happen when it is dry?** - This rhetorical question could be translated, "won't the punishment be much more severe for people who are sinners?" (The expected answer is yes.)
