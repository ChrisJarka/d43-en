\p
\v 18 Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor
counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to
any of his words.
\v 19 Give heed to me, O Jehovah, and listen to the voice of them that contend with me.
\v 20 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before you to speak
good for them, to turn away your wrath from them.
