\v 17 We \add should\add* love others completely. And if we do that, when the time comes for \add him to\add* judge us, we will be confident \add that he will not condemn us\add* (OR\add , that we have a close relationship with him\add*). \add We will be confident of that\add* because of our \add conducting our lives\add* in this world as Christ did.
\v 18 We will not be afraid \add of God\add* if we \add truly\add* love \add him\add*, because those who love \add God\add* completely cannot possibly be afraid \add of him\add*. \add We would be\add* afraid only \add if we thought that he would\add* punish us. So those who are afraid \add of God certainly\add* are not loving \add God\add* completely.

\v 17 In this is love has been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, even so are we in this world.
\v 18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love throws out fear, because fear has punishment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love.
