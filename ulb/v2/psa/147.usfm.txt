\c 147
\q
\v 1 Praise you Jehovah;
\q For it is good to sing praises to our God;
\q For it is pleasant, and praise is comely.
\q
\v 2 Jehovah does build up Jerusalem;
\q He gathers together the outcasts of Israel.
\q
\v 3 He heals the broken in heart,
\q And bindeth up their wounds.
\q
\v 4 He counts the number of the stars;
\q He calls them all by their names.
\q
\v 5 Great is our Lord, and mighty in power;
\q His understanding is infinite.
\q
\v 6 Jehovah upholdeth the meek:
\q He brings the wicked down to the ground.
\q
\v 7 Sing to Jehovah with thanksgiving;
\q Sing praises upon the harp to our God,
\q
\v 8 Who covers the heavens with clouds,
\q Who prepares rain for the earth,
\q Who makes grass to grow upon the mountains.
\q
\v 9 He gives to the beast his food,
\q And to the young ravens which cry.
\q
\v 10 He delights not in the strength of the horse:
\q He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
\q
\v 11 Jehovah takes pleasure in them that fear him,
\q In those that hope in his lovingkindness.
\q
\v 12 Praise Jehovah, O Jerusalem;
\q Praise your God, O Zion.
\q
\v 13 For he has strengthened the bars of your gates;
\q He has blessed your children within thee.
\q
\v 14 He makes peace in your borders;
\q He fills you with the finest of the wheat.
\q
\v 15 He sends out his commandment upon earth;
\q His word runs very swiftly.
\q
\v 16 He gives snow like wool;
\q He scatters the hoarfrost like ashes.
\q
\v 17 He throws forth his ice like morsels:
\q Who can stand before his cold?
\q
\v 18 He sends out his word, and melteth them:
\q He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
\q
\v 19 He showeth his word to Jacob,
\q His statutes and his ordinances to Israel.
\q
\v 20 He has not dealt so with any nation;
\q And as for his ordinances, they have not known them.
\q Praise you Jehovah.
