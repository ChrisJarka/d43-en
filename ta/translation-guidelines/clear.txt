====== Creating Clear Translations ======

There are several things involved with making a clear translation from the source text into your language. I will list them here and we will look deeper into each of them.

  * You will need to check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.
  * Be sure you understand who is doing the action.  A clear translation will identify the subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it.
  * You will need to change each EVENT idea into an active clause. 
  * Change passive verbs to the active form.  
  * You will also look at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the possessive construction.

Let us start with “check the pronouns”.\\
You will need to check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.
Pronouns are words that stand in the place of a noun or a noun phrase. They refer back to something that has already been mentioned. 

In this sentence; 

“The boy ate his dinner.” 

‘boy’ is the noun and ‘his’ is a pronoun that refers back to the boy. (For more information see the Translation Academy page on English Sentence Structure and Parts of Speech.)

Confusion can arise if it is not clear to whom or what a particular pronoun refers. Compare the following translations of Mark chapter 9 verses 20 and 21.
Reading from the Unfolding Word Literal Bible: And __they__ brought __him__ to __him__: and when __he__ saw __him__, straightway the spirit shook __him__ severely; and __he__ fell on the ground foaming at the mouth. And __he__ asked __his__ father, “How long time has __he__ been like this?” And __he__ said, “From a child.”

__The pronouns are underlined.__

Is it immediately clear who or what each pronoun refers to?  It may not be clear to the reader.  Each language has its own pattern of pronoun reference. Therefore, to avoid confusion, you may sometimes need to use a noun in the translation where the source text has a pronoun.

REMEMBER:  Always check carefully that it is clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.

Next you need to understand who is doing the action.  Check each abstract noun, also known as the EVENT idea, or passive verb form to be sure you understand who is doing the action. 

A good translation will identify the person, or subject, who is doing the action and the person or thing, the object, that has the action done to them or it.  

The PARTICIPANTS in an event are the people or things which take part in that event. When re-expressing an EVENT idea as a verb, it is often necessary to state who or what are the PARTICIPANTS in that event. Usually this will be clear from the context.

Consider the action of this statement:  **The dog ate the meat.**
In this sentence the //dog// is the //Subject//. The //meat// is the //Object// and //ate// is the //Action//.

Since the PARTICIPANTS in an event are the people or things which take part in that event. The dog and the meat are the Participants.  The EVENT is ate.

Matthew 24 verse 31 states: ….gather his elect from the four winds.

Consider the implied action of the noun phrase of ‘his elect.’\\
This phrase could be re-stated as:  --->  the people whom (God) has chosen

Since the PARTICIPANTS in an event are the people or things which take part in that event. God and people are the Participants.  The EVENT is chosen, the past tense of to choose.

REMEMBER: A clear translation will identify the PARTICIPANTS. The subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it. 

Now let us look at the next item:

You will need to change each EVENT idea into an active clause to be sure it is understood.  Later, if your language will allow you to change active verbs into EVENT ideas, try to use the noun form. 

James chapter 4 verse 9 states, “Let your laughter be turned to mourning …”

The nouns, (laughter, mourning) in this example are actually EVENT ideas in the passage. 
This could be re-expressed:  “Don’t laugh any more, instead begin to mourn or weep”

Notice the noun in the first version is replaced in the simpler version with a verb.

1 Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 15 says, “until the coming of the Lord, . . .”
This could be re-expressed:  “until the Lord comes”

When preparing to translate, it is helpful to look for any EVENT ideas in the passage, especially those which are expressed by some form other than a verb. See if you can re-express the meaning using a verb to express the EVENT idea. This is useful for two reasons:

1. It helps to reveal more precisely the meaning of the source text. The meaning, especially the relationships between ideas, often appears more clearly when the EVENT ideas are expressed as verbs.

2. Often this restructuring will help the translator to find an easier way to express the meaning in the Target Language.




To translate the Bible to be CLEAR means to evaluate your translation and make it clear.

  * For each pronoun, make it clear to whom or what it refers.
  * For each abstract noun or passive verb form, identify the one who does the action (subject) and the one or thing that has the action done to them/it (object).
  * Identify the implied participants of active verbs.
  * Determine the intended meaning of possessive constructions (for example, the love of God).

**Word for Word Substitution**  - Literal translations, or word for word substitution, is not the best choice for doing excellent translations because they look only at individual words in the text, result in awkward text, may contain improper grammar, and presents an unclear or wrong meaning in the target text.
