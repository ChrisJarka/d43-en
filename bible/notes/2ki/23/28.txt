\v 28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Judah?
\v 29 In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates, and King Josiah fought against him, and Pharaoh Neco killed Josiah at Megiddo, after seeing him there.
\v 30 Josiah's servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own sepulchre. So the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him and made him king in his fatherâ€™s place.
