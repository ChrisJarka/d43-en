\v 8 Or, suppose that a woman has ten very valuable silver coins and then she loses one of them. Certainly she will light a lamp and sweep the floor and search carefully until she finds it.
\v 9 And when she finds it, she will call together her friends and neighbors and say to them, "Be very happy with me, because I have found the coin that I lost!'
\v 10 I tell you that, in a similar way, there is much joy among the angels of God because of one sinner who repents from his sins ."

\v 8 Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she were to lose one coin, would not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she has found it?
\v 9 And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.'
\v 10 Even so, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * Jesus continues speaking to the Pharisees and scribes
    * **if she were to lose**  - or, "if she lost"
    * **What woman ... would not light a lamp ... and seek diligently until she has found it?**- This is a rhetorical question. <font 14px line-height: 19px;/Lato, sans-serif;;rgb(51, 51, 51) font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;;;#ffffff>Jesus was reminding the people that if any of them lost one of their ten silver coins, they would certainly look for it diligently. This sentence could also be translated as “If you had ten silver coins and lost one of them, you would diligently look for the lost one until you found it.” (See:</font> [[https://door43.org/en/ta/figuresofspeech/rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]]<font 14px line-height: 19px;/Lato, sans-serif;;rgb(51, 51, 51) font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;;;#ffffff>)</font>
