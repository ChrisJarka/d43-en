====== watch, watchman ======

===== Definition: =====

In biblical times, a "watch" was a period of time at night during which a watchman for a city would be on the alert looking out for any threat from an enemy. Each watchman would take his turn being on duty for 3 to 4 hours.

  * For the purpose of appointing watchmen to guard a city, the 12-hour period at night was divided into equal time periods called "watches." <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>In New Testament times, the Jews followed the Roman system and had four watches of three hours each.</font>
  * Based on this, the "first watch" would be from sunset to around 9:00 pm, the "second watch" would be from 9:00 pm to midnight, the "third watch" would be from midnight to around 3:00 am and the "fourth watch" would be from 3:00 to 6:00 am.
  * These could also be translated more generally with phrases such as, "early evening" or "late at night" or "the middle of the night."
