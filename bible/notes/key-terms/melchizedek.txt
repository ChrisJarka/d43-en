===== Facts: =====

During the time when Abram lived, Melchizedek was the king of Salem (later called Jerusalem). He was also called a "priest of God Most High."

  * Melchizedek's name means, "king of righteousness."

  * Then Abram gave Melchizedek one-tenth of the plunder from his victory.
  * In the New Testament, Jesus is called a priest in the "order of Melchizedek." Jesus is our Great High Priest but he is not like the Israelite priests who were descended from Levi. Jesus' priesthood comes directly from God, and is not from human descent.
