\v 17 After Jesus heard what they were asking, he said to the men who taught the Jewish laws, "People who healthy do not need a doctor. On the contrary, those who are sick need a doctor.  I did not come to call those who think they are righteous to change their minds about their sin.  On the contrary, I came to call people who know that they are sinners to change their minds about their sin."
