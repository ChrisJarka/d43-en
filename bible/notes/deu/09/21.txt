===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **your sin**  - Moses uses the word sin to mean the metal calf representing the people's sin of idolatry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **you** and **your** - Here again, throughout this passage the word you is plural, referring to the entire people of Israel and, more specifically, to the generation that came before them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual]])
