===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to speak to the lord.
  * **Hold out the scepter of your strength from Zion** - A scepter represents the strength and power of a king. AT: "Rule as king with strength from Zion." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Your people follow you of their own free will** - Possible meanings are 1) "Your people freely give themselves to you" or "Your people eagerly follow you" or 2) "Your people are abundant rains." This phrase compares the large number of people in the army to a great amount of rain. AT: "You will have very many people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **on the day of the showing of your majestic power ** - "on the day that you summon your army" or "when you gather your army"
  * **on the holy mountains; in the womb of the dawn go out like the dew of your youth** - "the dew of your young people is dressed in the splendid cloths of holiness from the womb of the dawn." Yahweh compares the glory and the purity of the people of the army to the glory and purity of dew in the morning. AT: "The young people of your army are glorious and pure like the dew of the morning." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **on the holy mountains**  - This refers to the mountains of Zion. This phrase could also be translated as "dressed in marvelous and holy clothes." The people of the army, whom Yahweh compares with dew, are wearing holy cloths like the cloths that priests wear.
  * **in the womb of the dawn** - "from the womb of the dawn." Yahweh describes the dew as a baby to whom the dawn gives birth. AT: "at dawn." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **go out like the dew of your youth **- AT: "that is what your dew, which is your young people, is like"
