\v 14 Sing, daughter of Zion! Cheer, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem!
\v 15 Yahweh has taken away your judgments; he has cast out your enemies! Yahweh is the king of Israel in your midst. You will never again fear evil!
\v 16 In that day they will say to Jerusalem, 'Do not fear, Zion. Do not let your hands falter.'   [[I used “they will
say” to make it an active voice. The dropping of hands/growing slack due to fear seems to be captured well with “falter” so I used that.”]]
