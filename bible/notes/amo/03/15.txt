===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the winter house with the summer house** - Some of the wealthy people had two houses: one that they lived in during the winter and one that they lived in during the summer. This refers to any winter and summer houses. AT: "the houses they live in during the winter and the houses they live in during the summer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **The houses of ivory will perish** - God speaks of the houses being destroyed as if they were alive and would die. AT: "The houses of ivory will be destroyed" or "The houses of ivory will collapse" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **The houses of ivory** - This refers to houses that had decorations made of ivory on the walls and furniture. Ivory was very expensive, so only the wealthy people had things decorated with ivory. AT: "the houses that are decorated with ivory"
  * **ivory** - the teeth and horns of large animals
  * **and the large houses will vanish** - "and the large houses will exist no more." Here "vanish" represents being destroyed. AT: "and the large houses will be destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:02:11|2:11]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
