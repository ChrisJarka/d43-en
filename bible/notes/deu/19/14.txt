===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses is still speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **You must not remove your neighbor’s landmark**  - "You must not take away the markers that show where the borders of your neighbor's land are." This implies that you would take the markers away from the borders of your neighbor's land so you can say that you own some of that land. AT: "You must not take land away from your neighbor by moving the markers on the borders of his land." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])  
  * **that they set in place a long time ago, in your inheritance**  - "the borders that your ancestors set up when they first got possession of the land"
  * **in your inheritance**  - "which is your inheritance"
