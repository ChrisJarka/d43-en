===== Level Three Approval =====

I, as a representative of a Bible translation Organization or a Church Network serving the language community of the translation that my organization has examined, affirm the following: 

1. The translation conforms to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines.
2. The translation is accurate and clear in the target language.
3. The translation uses an acceptable style of the language.
4. The community approves of the translation.

If any problems remain unresolved after meeting with the translation team a second time, please make note of them here.
