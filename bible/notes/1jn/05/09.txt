<usfm>
\v 9 We usually believe what other people tell us. But we can certainly trust much more in what God says. And what God is that he has testified about his Son.
\v 10 Those who trust in the Son of God know within their inner beings what is true about him. But those who do not believe what God says call him a liar, because they have refused to believe what God as testified about his Son.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For the testimony of God is this, that he has borne witness concerning his Son.
\v 10 He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed the witness that God has borne concerning his Son.
