\v 21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning,
behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear.
\v 22 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son. And this said, No; but the dead is your
son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.
