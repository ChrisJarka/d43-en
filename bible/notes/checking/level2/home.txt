====== Level 2 Checking (Language Community) ======

Level 2 checking will be done by a wider group of people from the language community. It is assumed that the checkers will be native speakers of the language. The purpose of this level of checking is to verify that a larger group of the target population agrees that the translation is a good one.

The primary questions that the community leaders should ask about the translator are:

  * Is the translator recognized as a qualified local language speaker?
  * Does the translator have adequate national language skills?
  * Is the translator respected in the community as a follower of Christ?

The primary questions that the community leaders should ask about the translation are:

  * Do the words and phrases of the translation make the message clear?
  * When compared verse by verse with the national translation, did the meaning of the translation follow the message (not necessarily the wording) of the national translation?
  * Does the flow of the language of the translation sound natural for the language group?
  * Does the translation include all the events of the book that was translated?
  * Is the translation written at a level and style appropriate for the local audience?
  * Is the alphabet and spelling used in the book appropriate for the wider language community?

Each of these topics are important, and will be further developed below.
