===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 Or, if I send a plague into that land and cause the people and the animals to die \add from the plague\add* because I am very angry with those people,
\v 20 as surely as I am alive, even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in that country, they would not be able to save even their sons and daughters. They would save only themselves because of their being righteous. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare.

\v 19 Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast;
\v 20 though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither son nor
daughter; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
