\v 31 Jesus comes from heaven and he is higher in position than anyone else. We have our home on earth are we are limited to earthly rights and powers and can only use the language and concepts of the earth.  The one who comes from heaven is above everyone on the earth and everything there is.
\v 32 There is one here who now gives his testimony to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts what he says or trusts it to be true.
\v 33 Those who have trusted in what he said, testify that God is the source of all truth and he alone is the measure and standard of everything that is true.
