\v 34 Jesus replied, "Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you. All those who continue to sin are \add forced to obey\add* their sinful desires \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like\add* a slave \add is forced to obey his master\add*.
\v 35 A slave is not a permanent member of a family. But a son is a member of a family forever. \add Similarly, you say you are members of God's family because you are descendants of Abraham, but really, because you are like slaves of your sinful desires, you are no longer permanent members of God's family\add*.
\v 36 So if you allow me to free you, you will truly be free.

\v 34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.
\v 35 And the bondservant remains not in the house for ever: the son remains for ever.
\v 36 If therefore the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.
