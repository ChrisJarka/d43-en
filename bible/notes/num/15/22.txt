\v 22 There may be times when you Israelites do not obey all these instructions that I have given to Moses to tell you, but not because you intended to disobey them.
\v 23 There may be times when some of your descendants do not obey all these instructions that I have given to Moses to tell to you.
\v 24 If you or they sin \add by forgetting to obey these instructions\add* and none of the Israelite people realize that they were doing that, one young bull as an offering for all the people \add must be brought to the priest\add*. That will be pleasing to me \add when it is burned on the altar\add*. They must also bring to me a grain offering and an offering of wine, and a male goat, to be sacrificed to remove the guilt of their sin.

\v 22 And when you err, and do not observe all these commandments that Yahweh has spoken to Moses,
\v 23 even all that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses, from the day that Yahweh gave commandment and onward throughout your generations,
\v 24 then it will be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation will offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet aroma to Yahweh, with the grain offering of it, and the drink-offering of it, according to the decree, and one male goat for a sin offering.
