\v 3 Then he said to me, "On this scroll is written the \add words that Yahweh is speaking to\add* curse the entire country. On one side of the scroll it is written that every thief will be banished. On the other side it is written that everyone who tells a lie when he is solemnly promising to tell the truth will also be banished from the country.
\v 4 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says, 'I will send \add copies of\add* this scroll to the places where thieves live and to the houses of those who use my name when they solemnly promise to tell the truth. \add The copies of\add* this scroll will stay in their houses, until those houses and all their wood and stones are destroyed.'~"

\v 3 Then said he to me, "This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth, for every thief will be cut off
from one side according to their sin, while everyone who swears a holy oath will be cut off from the other side according to their words.
\v 4 I will send it out--this is Yahweh of hosts' declaration--so it will enter into the house of the thief and into the house of the one that swears falsely by my name.
It will remain in his house, and consume its timber and stones."
