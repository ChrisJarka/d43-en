\v 25 \add Unbelievers may think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add that\add* God was \add acting\add* foolishly \add by doing that\add*, but \add the truth is that\add* he was acting more wisely than unbelievers who \add think that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* they are wise. And unbelievers may think that God was \add acting\add* weakly \add by sending his son to die\add*, but he was acting more powerfully than unbelievers who \add think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add that they\add* act powerfully.

\v 24 But for us, we who experience God's call, it makes no difference if we are Jews or Greeks. Christ is the power of God to save and the wisdom of God to know him completely.
\v 25 Because what appears foolish to God is wiser that the most brilliant human being. And the weakest God can be, is stronger than the mightiest man.
