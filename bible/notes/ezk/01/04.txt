\v 4 And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.
\v 5 And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man;
\v 6 and every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.
