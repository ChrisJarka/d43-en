\v 16 "You \add Jewish leaders\add*, your punishment will be terrible! You are \add like people who are\add* blind \f + \ft metaphor \f* who are trying to lead others. You say, '\add In the case of\add* those who promise to \add do\add* something and then ask the Temple \add to affirm what they have promised\add*, it means nothing \add if they do not do what\add* they have promised. But if they ask the gold that is in the Temple \add to affirm what they have promised\add*, they must do what they promised.'
\v 17 You are fools, and you are \add like people who are\add* blind \f + \ft metaphor \f*! The gold \add that is in the Temple\add* is important, but \add the Temple\add* is even more important \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, because it is the Temple that the gold is in that sets the gold apart for a special use for God.

\v 16 Woe to you, you blind guides, that say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by
the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.
\v 17 You fools and blind: for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that has sanctified the gold?
