====== Metaphor [ˈmetəˌfôr, ˈmetəˌfər] ======


=== In a metaphor something is said to be something else of a different kind in order to focus on a particular trait that they both have in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it. ===

**Examples from English** \\ 
Her __heart was broken__ when her husband left her. (Her emotions are compared to a physical thing that could break.) \\ 
His __temper flared__ when she insulted him. (His anger is compared to a fire.) \\ 


**Examples from the Bible**\\

... the rising sun will come from heaven to help us, to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; Luke 1:78b-79a

This is a metaphor. The Savior is being compared to the rising sun, teaching spiritual truth is compared to the sun shining, lacking spiritual truth is compared to sitting in darkness, and the fear of death is compared to a shadow.  Just as the rising sun shines on those who have been living in darkness, the Savior will come and bring spiritual truth to those who lack spiritual truth and are afraid of death.

... who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 8 Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance. "Even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree, therefore, that does not produce good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.” Luke 3:7b, 8a, 9

There are two metaphors shown above.
A man chopping down a fruit tree that does not bear good fruit is a metaphor for God punishing people who live sinful lives. John was saying that just as a man puts his axe to a tree's roots when he is about to chop it down, God was about to punish his people.

//I want to urge you// again //that you should// love //your// __fellow believers__. 1 Thessalonians 4:9 (TFT)

Paul reminded the people to have "brotherly love" for one another. "Brother" is a metaphor fellow believers, probably because the believers' love for one another should be like the kind of love brothers have for one another.

Do not //refuse the urging from God’s// Spirit //when he is working// [MTY] //among you. That would be like// __throwing water on //a fire//__ [MET]. 1 Thessalonians 5:19 (TFT)

Paul wrote not to extinguish or put out the Spirit. In this metaphor, Paul compares God's Spirit, or the urging of God's Spirit, to a fire. And he compares refusing to obey the Spirit's urging to putting out a fire.  Refusing to obey the Spirit's urging keeps him from working in our lives just as throwing water on a fire extinguishes it and stops it from burning.\\ 
In the TFT this metaphor is translated as a simile with the word ‘like’ in “That would be like throwing water on a fire.”
