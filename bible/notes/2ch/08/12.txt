===== translationNotes: =====

  * **his altar that he had built** - The author writes about Solomon having his workers build the altar as if he himself had built it. AT: "on Yahweh's altar that Solomon had his workers build" or "the Yahweh's altar that he had commanded his workers to build" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **his altar** - "Yahweh's altar" or "the altar of Yahweh"
  * **the portico** - This was a covered porch supported by columns, attached to the front of the temple. AT: "the temple porch" or "the entrance to the temple" 
  * **the daily schedule required** - "as was required each day"
  * **following the directions** - Here "following the directions" represents obeying them. AT: "obeying the directions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the directions found in the commandment of Moses** - "what Moses had commanded them"
  * **the set festivals three times every year** - "the three festivals that they were to celebrate every year"
  * **the Festival of Shelters** - "the Festival of Tents."  This is a festival to celebrate God's provision for his people. When the people of Israel wandered in the desert, they lived in temporary shelters. Each year when they harvested their crops, they stayed in temporary shelters in their gardens. In both situations, God provided for them.
