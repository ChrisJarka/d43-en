\v 14 For the body is not one member, but many.
\v 15 If the foot shall say, "Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body;" it is not true that it is therefore not of the body.
\v 16 And if the ear shall say, "Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body;" it is not true that it is therefore not of the body.
\v 17 If the whole body was an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole body was hearing, where would be the smelling?
