===== Microphones =====

//This answers the question:// //How is a good voice-recording microphone identified?//

A microphone, or mic, is the piece of equipment that captures the character and energy of a sound wave and converts it to an electrical pulse.

====  Design Types ====

Microphones are available today in many shapes and sizes, but the visible external differences are not a clear indicator of how the mic will perform in the recording environment. Instead, there are some important internal design characteristics of microphones that play the biggest role in determining its characteristic behaviors and its suitability for voice recording, particularly in sub-optimal conditions. Let's take a look at the common designs for signal transfer method and direction of sensitivity.

=== Signal Transfer Method ===

Signal transfer method is not a description any microphone manufacturer uses, but it is a good way to think about the design aspect that registers sound waves and converts them to an electronic signal passed through wires and eventually to the recording device. There are nearly a dozen designs that do this, but only two of them are widely used in the voice recording context this manual is intended to support so we will only focus on those two.

**Dynamic** - This is a more robust design that relies on sound waves vibrating a thin piece of material, which then moves a coil of wire in close proximity to a magnet, thus generating electrical current in the wires. Dynamic mics are a very solid design that are often characterized as more durable, yet less sensitive than the other common design.

**Condenser** - This is a design that makes use of a thin material (diaphragm) that is always electrically charged. When sound waves cause it to vibrate, it makes small changes to the electrical field between the diaphragm and a nearby metal plate, thus creating electrical current. This design requires an external DC power source to electrically charge the diaphragm.
While dynamic and condenser designs have some general similarities, the constantly charged diaphragm of the condenser design is much more sensitive to sound waves, especially in sensitivity to high frequencies. Condenser mics are considered to be more fragile that dynamic mics. However, many designs are quite durable and condensers have become the design chosen in nearly all consumer electronic devices manufactured today, including mobile phones.

=== Direction of Sensitivity ===

Often described as a mic's polar pattern, there are many different designs for how strongly a mic senses (hears) or rejects sound from different directions. There are three major classifications for polar patterns, only one of which we recommend using for voice recording.

**Unidirectional** – Unidirectional mics are sensitive only on one side. This design is best for voice recording. Examples of this design include cardiod, hypercardioid and supercardioid patterns.

**Omnidirectional** – Omnidirectional mics are equally sensitive from all directions. These are not good for voice recording.

**Bi-directional** – Bi-directional mics are equally sensitive on two opposite sides. These are also not good for voice recording.


==== Connectivity Types ====

Microphones are available with a variety of cable connection types. The mics are designed to be compatible with the standard electrical specifications of the intended connecting interface or device. Below we will identify the most common types of connections that consistently produce the best results, are the most reliable and versatile, and are the easiest to use for the task of audio recording.


=== XLR Connection ===
This is the most common connection type for professional microphones. Mics with an XLR connection will typically produce the very best audio quality.

XLR mics cannot connect directly to a laptop or tablet. They require the use of an intermediate device like an audio interface or mixing console to convert the signal and/or cable type to one compatible with a recording device. Audio interfaces typically connect to a laptop by USB connection or Firewire connection. Most interfaces provide the recordist with simple analog controls for adjusting mic gain levels and playback listening volume.


=== USB Connection ===
USB Mics are becoming more popular because they can simply connect directly to a computer. Originally having poor audio quality, many professional mic manufacturers are beginning to produce USB mics capable of excellent sound quality. Currently, the tradeoff for direct USB connectivity to a computer can be the loss of simple analog controls for both mic gain and playback volume. For many USB mics, these controls are now contained in digital menus in the mic or in the computer control panel settings. In some cases, recording software includes handy shortcuts or features to make level adjustments.

Our testing and research with Android tablets indicates a significant degree of unreliability among most tablets in recognizing a connected USB mic. So we only suggest that USB mics be used dependably with laptops at this time.


=== 3.5 mm TRRS ===
TRRS mics are a newer connection style that are compatible with many mobile devices and some laptops wired with a 4-conductor audio jack. TRRS wiring handles incoming audio signals and outgoing audio signals through a single jack. TRRS mics will vary in sound quality and design. Most are ill-suited for quality audio recording due to design. However, there is at least one excellent option available for voice recording at a very affordable price.

It is important to be aware that even if a quality TRRS mic, such as an IK Multimedia iRig Mic Cast, is used the quality of the recorded audio may still be poor. The problem is not with the mic itself, but rather with the trend of poor quality audio conversion hardware in most Android devices.
