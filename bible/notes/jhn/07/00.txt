====== John 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This whole chapter revolves around the concept of believing Jesus to be the [[:en:obe:kt:christ|messiah]]. Some people believe this to be true while others rejected it. Some were willing to recognize his power and even the possibility that he was a [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophet]], but most are unwilling to believe that he was the messiah.

Translators may wish to include a note at verse 53 to explain to the reader why they have chose to (or not to) translate verses 7:53-8:11.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "My time has not yet come" ==
This phrase and "his hour had not yet come" are used in this chapter to indicate that Jesus is in control of the events unfolding in his life. 

== "Living water" ==
This is an important image used in the New Testament. It is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]. Because this metaphor is given in a desert environment, it probably emphasizes that Jesus is able to give life sustaining nourishment.  

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Prophecy ==
Jesus gives a prophecy about his life without an explicit statement in John [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:07:33|7:33-34]].  

== Irony ==
Nicodemus explains to the other Pharisees that the Law requires to hear directly from a person before making a judgment about them. The Pharisees in turn made a judgment about Jesus without speaking to Jesus. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Did not believe in him" ==
Jesus' brothers did not believe that Jesus was the Messiah.

== "The Jews" ==
This term is used in two different ways in this passage. It is used specifically in reference to the opposition of the Jewish leaders who were trying kill him ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:07:01|7:1]]). It is also used in reference to the people of Judea in general who had a positive opinion of Jesus ([[:en:bible:notes:jhn:07:12|7:13]]). The translator may wish to use the terms "Jewish leaders" and "Jewish people" or "Jews (leaders)" and "Jews (in general)."
