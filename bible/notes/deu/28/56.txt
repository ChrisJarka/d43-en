<usfm>
\v 56 The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
\v 57 and toward her young one that comes out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall eat them for lack of all things secretly, in the siege and in the distress wherewith your enemy shall distress you in your gates.
