====== Biblical measures ======

===== Definition: =====

The following terms are the most common Biblical units of measure used to explain how much liquid (such as wine) or solid objects (such as grain) a certain receptacle contains.

  * bath - 22.0 liters
  * hin - 3.7 liters
  * homer - 230.0 liters
  * kab - 1.3 liters
  * kor - 220.0 liters
  * log - 0.3 liters
  * seah - 7.7 liters

There are different ways units of measure can be translated:

  - Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. [See Transliterate]  Then give the equivalent value using a unit of measure that is known to the receptor culture. This explanation can be given in the text or in a note.
  - An important reason for using words that closely resemble the Biblical terms for units of measuring quantity is to show that the Bible is an historical document and that real people used these units of measurement during that time period.
  - If it doesn't work to use the Biblical term, then instead, the equivalent distance or length in terms of a unit of measure that is known to the receptor culture can be used.
