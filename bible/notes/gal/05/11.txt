\v 11 But, my fellow believers, although someone claims that I am proclaiming that men must be circumcised, I certainly am not still proclaiming that. Remember that the Jews are still persecuting me. If I were still proclaiming that men must be circumcised in order for God to accept them, the Jews would not be persecuting me. They would  not be persecuting me because then the Jews would no longer be offended. They are offended because I proclaim that Christ, the Messiah, died on the cross.
\v 12 I would even wish that those who are disturbing you by insisting that men be circumcised would also emasculate themselves, with the result that they would be expelled from your congregations!

\v 11 Brothers, if I still preach circumcision why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has
ceased.
\v 12 I wish that those who disturb you would be castrated.
