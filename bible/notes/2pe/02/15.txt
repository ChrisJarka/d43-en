\v 15 They refuse to live like God wants them to. They have imitated what the prophet Balaam, the son of Beor, did long ago. He thought he would act in a wicked way and gain a reward for it.
\v 16 But God rebuked him for sinning. And even though donkeys do not speak, God used Balaam's own donkey to speak to him with a human voice and stop his insane action.

<usfm>
\v 15 They have abandoned the right way. They went astray and they have followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved to receive payment for unrighteousness.
\v 16 But he obtained a rebuke for his own transgression. A mute pack animal speaking in a human voice stopped the prophet's insanity.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **"they" - **  Refers to the "mindless animals"/ false teachers in 2:12
  * **Balaam**  - the son of Beor, was a man of some rank among the Midianites (Numbers 31:8). He resided at Pethor (Deuteronomy 23:4), in Mesopotamia (Numbers 23:7). It is evident that though dwelling among idolaters he had some knowledge of the true God; and was held in such reputation that it was supposed that he whom he blessed was blessed, and he whom he cursed was cursed.
