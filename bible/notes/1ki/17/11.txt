\v 11 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in your hand.
\v 12 And she said, As Jehovah your God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
\v 13 And Elijah said to her, Fear not; go and do as you have said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth to me, and afterward make for you and for your son.
