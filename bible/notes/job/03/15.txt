===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Or I would have been lying...that never see the light**  - Verses 14 and 15 continue Job's thoughts about dying before he was born. This describes something that might have happened but did not happen. (See: Hypothetical)
  * **I would have been lying with princes**  - "I would be resting with princes."(ULB) In this phrase, "lying" and "resting" is a polite way of saying "no longer alive." (See:Euphemism)
  * **I would have been lying**  - This verbal phrase is not in the Hebrew but has been supplied in the ULB in order to make a complete sentence.
  * **who once had gold, who had filled their houses with silver** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing, that the princes are wealthy, and are used together for emphasis. (See:Parallelism)
  * **Or perhaps I would have been stillborn, like infants that never see the light** - These two clauses basically describe the same thing and are repeated for emphasis. (See:Parallelism)
  * **I would have been stillborn**  - In the Hebrew, the word used describes "a child who has died in its mother's womb before reaching the time of birth", rather than "stillborn" which means a baby that is not born alive.
  * **like infants that never see the light**  - "like babies who had never been born"
  * **infants**  - "babies" or "very small children"
