== David's adultery and murder == 
The Army of Israel defeated the army of Ammon and then they besieged Ammon's capital. But David stayed in Jerusalem. One day he saw a beautiful woman, named Bathsheba bathing. He had her brought to him and he committed adultery with her. She became pregnant. He asked that her husband be sent back to him as a messenger, expecting him to go home and sleep with his wife and then he would think the baby was his. But he slept at the palace instead. So David sent him back to the battle with orders to the general to get him killed by the Ammon army. But God was angry at David for doing this.
