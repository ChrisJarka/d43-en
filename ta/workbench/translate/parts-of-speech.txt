====== Parts of Speech ======

Parts of speech are categories of words. All languages have parts of speech, and all words in a language belong to a part of speech. All languages have some of these parts of speech, and some languages have others.  This is not an exhaustive list of parts of speech, but it covers the basics.

**VERBS** are words that express either an action (such as come, go, eat) or a state-of-being (such as is, are, was.) More detailed information can be found on [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_verbs]].

**NOUNS** are words that represent a person, place, thing, or idea. Common nouns are generic (man, city, country). Names are capitalized and refer to a specific entity (Peter, Jerusalem, Egypt).

**PRONOUNS** take the place of nouns and include such words as he, she, it, they and we. More detailed pages on pronouns can be found on [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:pronouns]].

**CONJUNCTIONS** are words that join phrases or sentences. Examples include: and, or, but, for, yet, nor. Some conjunctions are used in pairs: both/and; either/or; neither/nor; not only/but also. (More information about these can be found on [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_connectingwords|Connecting Words]])

**PREPOSITIONS** are words that begin phrases which connect a noun or verb with more detail. For example, "The boat was //off the shore//." Here the phrase with "off" tells the location of the boat in relations to the shore. Another example would be "The crowd //around Jesus// grew in numbers." The phrase with "around" tells the location of the people in relation to Jesus. Some examples of prepositions are: to, from, in, out, on, off, with, without, above, below, before, after, behind, in front of, among, through, beyond, among.

**ARTICLES** are the term used to describe the words: a, an, the. "The" is a definite article which means a specific one (e.g. the dog) instead of a generic description such as "a dog." 'A' is used preceding words that start with a consonant letter (e.g. a book); 'An' is used preceding words beginning with a vowel (e.g. an egg). Articles are actually part of a larger group of words called adjectives.

**ADJECTIVES** are words that describe nouns and convey such things as quantity, size and color; they help us identity 'which one' or 'what kind.' Sometimes people use adjectives to tell which one, and sometimes people use them to tell something about them. For example - My eldest sister (“Eldest” tells which one.) My elderly father (“Elderly” tells something about my father). (More information about this can be found on [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish|Distinguishing versus Informing or Reminding]])

**ADVERBS** are words that describe verbs or adjectives and tell such things as how, when, why, to what extent or where. Many English adverbs end in 'ly.',
