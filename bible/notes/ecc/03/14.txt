====== Ecclesiastes 03:14-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I also know that what God does endures forever. No one can add to what God does, and no one can take away from the things that God does. God does those things in order that people would revere him.
\q1
\v 15 Things that exist now have already existed previously,
\q2 and things that will happen in the future have already happened previously;
\q2 God causes the same things to happen many times.

<usfm>
\v 14 I know that, whatever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God
has done it, that men should fear before him.
\v 15 That which is has been long ago; and that which is to be has long ago been: and God seeks again that which is passed
away.
