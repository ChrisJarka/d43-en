====== unclean ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the term "unclean" is used figuratively to refer to things that God declared to be unfit for his people to touch or eat.

  * God gave the Israelites many instructions about not touching "unclean" things. If they did touch such things, they themselves would be declared unclean for a certain period of time.
  * Obeying God's commands about avoiding unclean things kept the Israelites holy, that is, separate and set apart for God's service.
  * A Jewish priest who touched something that God had declared to be unclean, would be considered ceremonially unclean and not fit to perform his religious duties.
  * In the Old Testament God gave the Israelites <font 14px line-height: 19.600000381469727px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>many instructions</font>    about which animals were "clean" and which ones were "unclean." The unclean animals could not be used for eating or for sacrifice.
  * Be careful that the translation of "unclean" animals does not mean the animal was dirty. Rather, it should be understood that this was a way of labeling the type of animals that God had said were not fit to be eaten or sacrificed.
  * An "unclean spirit" refers to an "evil spirit," that is, a "demon."
