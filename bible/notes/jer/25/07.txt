\v 7 But you have not listened to me—this is Yahweh's declaration—so you have provoked me with the work of your hands to do harm to you.
\v 8 So Yahweh of hosts says this, 'Because you did not listen to my words,
\v 9 see, I am about to send out a command to gather all the peoples of the north—this is Yahweh's declaration—with Nebuchadnezzar my servant, king of Babylon, and bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all the nations around you. For I will set them apart for destruction. I will turn them into a horror, an object for hissing, and an unending desolation.
