\v 17 Yet the children of your people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.
\v 18 When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die therein.
\v 19 And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
\v 20 Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
