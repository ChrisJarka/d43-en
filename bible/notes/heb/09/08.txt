\v 8 By those things the Holy Spirit indicated that just like God did not reveal the way for ordinary people to enter into the inner room, the very holy place, while the outer room still existed, similarly he did not reveal the way for ordinary people to enter the presence of God while the Jewish system of offering sacrifices was in effect.
\v 9 The things that the priests did inside the outer room  symbolized what was true during the time when the first covenant was in effect. According to the first covenant (OR, In that outer room), priests offered gifts and other sacrifices to God. But by offering them, the people who brought them were unable to make themselves feel that they were no longer guilty for having sinned.
\v 10 They brought those gifts and made those sacrifices according to regulations concerning things to eat and drink, and according to rules that required people to wash various things. God declared that those regulations about our bodies were to be in effect until he put into effect the new covenant; that was a better system.

\v 8 The Holy Spirit is demonstrating that the way into the most holy place has not yet been made available as long as the first room is still standing.
\v 9 This is a figure for the present age; according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot cleanse the conscienceof  the worshipper. 
\v 10 They are only (meats and drinks and various washings) regulations concerning the body, imposed until a time of reformation.
