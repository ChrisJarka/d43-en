<usfm>
\v 13 They must not come near me to serve as priests. They must not come near any sacred things or the holy offerings. They must be ashamed of the shameful things that they did.
\v 14 But I will still put them in charge of the work in the temple, and allow them to do all the work that needs to be done there.

\v 13 And they will not come near to me to act as my priests or to draw near to any of my holy things, to the most holy things! But they will lift up their reproach and their abominations that they have done.
\v 14 Yet I will set them as keepers of the ministry of the house, for all of its workings and for everything that is done in it.
