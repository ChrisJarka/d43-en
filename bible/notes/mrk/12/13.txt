\v 14 After they arrived, they said to him \add deceivingly\add*, "Teacher, we know that you \add teach\add* the truth. We also know that you are not concerned about \add what\add* people \add say about you, even if an important person does not like what you say\add*. Instead, you teach truthfully what God wants \add us to do\add*. So \add tell us what you think about this matter:\add* Is it right that we pay taxes to the Roman government, or not \f + \ft metonymy \f*? Should we pay the taxes, or should we not pay them?"

\v 13 And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in talk.
\v 14 And when they were come, they say to him, Teacher, we know that you are true, and carest not for any one; for you
regard not the person of men, but of a truth teachest the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
\v 15 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why make you trial of me? bring me a
denarius, that I may see it.
