===== Discover the Meaning of the Text =====

There are many different things we can do in order to find the meaning of the text. Here are a few suggestions:

  - Read the whole passage through before you translate. Understand the main point of the whole passage before you begin. If it is a narrative passage, such as a story of one of Jesus' miracles, picture the original situation. Imagine you were there. Imagine how people felt.
  - When translating the Bible, always use at least two versions of the Bible together as your source text. Comparing two versions will help you to think about the meaning, so that you do not just follow the words of one version literally. The two versions should be:
      * One version that follows the form of the original language fairly closely like the unfoldingWord Literal Bible (ULB).
      * One meaning-based version like the unfoldingWord Dynamic Bible (UDB).
  - Use the Important Terms resources to learn about terms you are not familiar with. Words sometimes have more than one meaning. Make sure you have understood the right meaning of the word in the passage.
  - Also use the Translation Notes in the transaltionStudio program. If possible, use other reference books, such as other versions of the Bible, a Bible dictionary or Bible commentaries.
