===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **returned out of the country of Moab**  - That is, "returned from the country of Moab"
  * **beginning of the barley harvest**  - At the beginning of the barley harvest, only the workers are allowed into the fields. This is important to know because in chapter two, Ruth is allowed into the field even though she is not a worker.
