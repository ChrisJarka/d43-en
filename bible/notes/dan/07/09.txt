===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **thrones were set in place** - AT: "someone set thrones in the right place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Ancient of Days** - This is a title for God that means he is eternal. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **He took his seat ... His clothing ... the hair on his head** - This passage describes God as if he can sit down, wears clothing, and has hair like a person. This does not mean that God really is like this, but it is how Daniel saw God in a vision.
  * **took his seat** - "sat down" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **His clothing was as white as snow** - These are compared to show his clothes are very white. AT: "His clothing was very white"
  * **the hair of his head was like pure wool** - These two are compared to say something about what God's hair looked like. Possible meanings 1) it was very white (UDB) 2) it was thick and curly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **pure wool** - AT: "clean wool" or "wool that is washed"
  * **His throne was flames ... were burning fire** - This describes God as if he has a throne with wheels, both made of fire. The words "flames" and "burning fire" mean basically the same thing and can be translated the same way.
