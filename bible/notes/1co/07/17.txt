\v 17 However, each person should continue in the status that the Lord gave him, the status that he had when the Lord called him \add to belong to him\add*. That is the rule that I tell people in all the congregations \add where I speak\add*.
\v 18 If a man had already been circumcised \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* when he became a Christian, he should not \add try to pretend that he is not\add* circumcised. If a man had not been circumcised \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* before he became a Christian, he should not become circumcised.
\v 19 \add You should not try to change your status that way\add*, because it means nothing \add to God\add* whether someone is circumcised or not. What is important is that we obey what God has commanded.

\v 17 When we come to Christ, each one should live the life the Lord has assigned to him. This means that the station, position, or jobs we have should not change because God saved you. You learn to live as a Christian in that place and with those people. God has called each of you to a different situation and you must learn to live for God where you are, and share your faith with these people God gave to you. This is the principle in all the churches.
\v 18 If a man were circumcised before he became a Christian, he should not try to remove those marks of the covenant. If you were not circumcised when God saved you, you have not need to become circumcised. Circumcision is not what validates your faith.
\v 19 Circumcision or uncircumcision, they are not important in our salvation. But what does matter is living in obedience and doing the things that God commands us to do.

\v 17 Only let each one live the life the Lord has assigned them, and to which God called them.  This is my rule in all the churches.
\v 18 Was anyone circumcised when God called him? He should not try to remove the marks of his circumcision. Was anyone uncircumcised when God called him? He should not receive the marks of circumcision. 
\v 19 For it is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision that matters. But what matters is obeying the commandments of God.
