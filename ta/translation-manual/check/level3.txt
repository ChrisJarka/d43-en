=== Checking Level 3 – Authenticated Check ===

There are two tracks by which content can achieve level 3.

Track 1 (Three Church Networks):

  * The first track is completed when the content has been thoroughly checked by at least three separate Church networks.
  * Those checking the translation must be first-language speakers of the language, and those signing off on the check must be leaders of the Church networks.
  * A leader of a Church network who is also a first-language speaker of the language of the translation may both check the translation and sign off on its quality.
  * Level 3 in this track is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of multiple elements of the Church internal.

Track 2 (Trained Translation Checker + One Church Network):

  * The second track is completed when the content has been thoroughly checked by an accountable entity in the unfoldingWord network that has training and experience in checking translated biblical content, as well as by a Church network with first-language speakers of the language (as described in the first track).
  * Level 3 in this track is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of the Church internal and the Church global, as represented by the accountable entity.
  * //Note: Entities such as translation organizations and church denominations can be part of the unfoldingWord network, given that they agree with the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines and that they are publicly accountable in some way to constituents who are part of the Church (including donors, members, etc.). Based on the strength of the trust relationship between entities, the unfoldingWord network can grow rapidly and it becomes self-reinforcing as multiple nodes connect to each other.//

In either track, the checking entities must have a track record that does not contradict their assertion that they adhere to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines.

  * //This implements a “by their fruit you will know them” component. //
