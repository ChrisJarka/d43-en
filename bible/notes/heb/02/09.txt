But now he has been greatly \add honored\add* \f + \ft doublet \f* \add by being\add* crowned \add as kings are\add*.
\v 10 It was fitting that \add God\add* make\add Jesus\add* perfect\f + \ft Or: all that God intended him to be \f*.

\v 9 But we do know about Jesus, who possessed a position a little lower than the angels, but because of his suffering and death God has glorifed him and given him the place of highest honor, like a king who has authority over everything, because by God's compassion and power he has experienced death for everyone.



\p
\v 10 It was fitting that God make Jesus perfect to share his glory. God is the one who created all things, and he is the one for whom all things exist. He perfected Jesus by causing him to suffer and die, and Jesus is the one who enables God to save people.

\v 9 But we do see him who has been made a little lower than the angels--Jesus, because of his suffering death he has been crowned with glory and honor.  So now by the grace of God Jesus has tasted death for every man.
\v 10 It honored God, because everything is for him and everything is through him, to bring many sons to glory, and to make the author of their salvation complete through his sufferings.
