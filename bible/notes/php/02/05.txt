\v 5 Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus
\v 6 who, existing in the form of God, did not count being equal with God a thing to be seized.
\v 7 But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.
\v 8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even to death, yes, the death of the cross.
