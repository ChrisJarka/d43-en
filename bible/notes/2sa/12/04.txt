\v 4 And there came a traveller to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the
wayfaring man that was come to him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
\v 5 And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that has done
this is worthy to die:
\v 6 and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
