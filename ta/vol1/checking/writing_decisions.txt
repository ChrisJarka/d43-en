===== Decisions for Writing Your Language =====

This module answers the question: What are some decisions we need to make for writing our language?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:checking:language_community_check|Language Community Check]]
  * [[en:ta:vol1:checking:other_methods|Other Methods]]
  * [[en:ta:vol1:process:pretranslation_training|Training Before Translation Begins]]

When a language is first written the translator must decide how to indicate certain features of all written languages. 
These questions will give the wider community an understanding of some of the preliminary decisions made by the translator for writing the local language in the areas of punctuation, spelling and the writing of names in the Bible. The translation team and the community should agree on how to do this.


Does your language have a way of highlighting direct or quoted speech? How do you show it? 

What guidelines have you followed for indicating verse numbering, quoted speech and Old Testament quotations? (Are you following the style of the national language? What variations have you decided to use to suit your language?) 

Have you decided to indicate section headings? If you are using section headings, which kind has the translation team decided to use (see examples below)? How does the national language handle section headings? (Is the community satisfied with the decisions of the translation team?) Be sure to use a kind of section heading that the people will understand is not part of the text that it introduces. 

Examples of section headings for Mark 2:1-12: 
  -Summary statement: “By healing a paralyzed man, Jesus demonstrated his authority to forgive sins as well as to heal.” 
  -Explanatory comment: “Jesus heals a paralyzed man.” 
  -Topical reference: “Cure of a paralytic.” 
  -Question: "Does Jesus have authority to heal and forgive sins?"
  -"About" comment: "About Jesus healing a paralyzed man."

What guidelines have you followed in writing names in the Bible? Do you use the names written in the national language Bible? Do you have guidelines from your own language as to how names are pronounced and if they need added titles? (Has this decision been acceptable to the community?) 

Have you taken note of any spelling rules for your language that you would like to share with others, such as where a word changes its form or two words combine? (Are these rules acceptable to the community?)
