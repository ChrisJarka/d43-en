\v 1 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the
sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
\v 2 And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovahâ€™s house.
\v 3 And all the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house; and they
bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and gave thanks to Jehovah,
saying, For he is good; for his lovingkindness endures
for ever.
