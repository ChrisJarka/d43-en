\v 17 So those Jews came \add here to Caesarea\add* when I came. I did not delay. The day after \add we\f + \ft exclusive \f* arrived\add*, after I sat down at the place where I make decisions, I \add commanded\add* that Paul be brought \f + \ft Or:\add soldiers\add* to bring Paul \f* into \add the courtroom\add*.
\v 18 The Jewish leaders did accuse him, but the things about which they accused him were not any of the \add evil\add* crimes about which I thought \add they would accuse him\add*.
\v 19 Instead, what they argued about with him were some teachings that \add some\add* Jews believe \add and others do not believe. They argued\add* about a man whose name was Jesus who had died, \add but the man they were accusing, whose name is\add* Paul, kept saying, 'Jesus is alive again.'
\v 20 I did not know what questions to ask \add them, and I did not know how to judge\add* concerning their dispute. So I asked Paul, 'Are you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* willing to go \add back\add* to Jerusalem and have the dispute \add between you and these Jews\add* judged there \f + \ft Or:and \add let me\add* judge there the dispute \add between you and these Jews\add* \f*?'

\v 17 So, when those Jews came here to Caesarea when I came. I did not delay the trial at all, the day after they arrived, we into the courtroom and I ordered the prisoner brought in.
\v 18 The accusations which the Jewish leaders brought against him did accuse him, but the things about which they accused him were not any of the evil crimes about of which I thought they would accuse him.
\v 19 Instead, what they argued about with him about were matters concerning their own religion and some teachings that some Jews believe and others do not believe. They argued about a man whose name was Jesus who had died, but whom Paul said was alive..the man they were accusing, whose name is Paul, kept saying, 'Jesus is alive again.'
\v 20 I did not know how to  understand this whole question,did not know what questions to ask them, and I did not know how to judge concerning their dispute. Sso I asked Paul, 'Are you willing to go to Jerusalem, and there be judged concerning these things?'

\v 17 Therefore, when they came together here, I did not wait, but the next day I sat in the judgment seat and I ordered the man to be brought in.
\v 18 When the accusers stood up and accused him, I thought that none of the charges that they brought against him were serious.
\v 19 Instead, they had certain disputes with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who was dead, whom Paul claims to be alive.
\v 20 I was puzzled about how to investigate this matter, and I asked him if he would go to Jerusalem to be judged there about these things.
