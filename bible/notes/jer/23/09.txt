\v 9 Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom
wine has overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of his holy words.
\v 10 For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried
up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right;
