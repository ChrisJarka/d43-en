===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **There is nothing from outside of a person that can defile him when it enters into him.  It is what comes out of the person that defiles him.**  - By clearly stating this truth Jesus is explaining why the ceremonial law is not as important as what is intended when people hear the Old Testament law.
