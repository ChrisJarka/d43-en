===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus amazes the Pharisees that he calls Levi, who is a tax collector, to follow him and that Jesus would eat with such sinners.

  * **the crowd came to him** - "the people went where he was"
  * **Alpheus** - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
