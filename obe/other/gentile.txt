====== Gentile ======

===== Facts: =====

A Gentile is a person who is not a Jew. That is, Gentiles are not descendants of Jacob, or Israel.

  * In the Bible, the term "uncircumcised" is also used figuratively to refer to Gentiles because many of them did not circumcise their male children as the Israelites did.
  * Because God chose the Jews to be his special people, they thought of the Gentiles as outsiders who could never be God's people.
  * The Jews were also called "Israelites" or "Hebrews" at different times in history. They referred to everyone else as a "Gentile."
  * Gentile could also be translated as "not a Jew" or "non-Jewish" or "not an Israelite" (Old Testament) or "non-Jew.".
  * Traditionally, Jews would not eat with Gentiles, which at first caused problems within the early church.
