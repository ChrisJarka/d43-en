\v 4 Then said Saul to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and thrust me through with it. Otherwise, these uncircumcised will come and abuse me." But his armor bearer would not, for he was very afraid. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.

  * [[:en:obe:kt:uncircumcised]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:fear]]
===== translationNotes: =====

  * **thrust me through with it** - The action of stabbing is a metonym for the result, death. AT: "kill me with it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Otherwise, these uncircumcised will come** - The nominal adjective "uncircumcised" here is a metonymic synecdoche for the physical uncircumcision that was a physical sign that they were God's enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **fell on it** - Saul probably stuck the handle into the ground and leaned on the point so the sword would go through his body as he fell down. The action is a metonym for the result, death. AT: "killed himself with it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
