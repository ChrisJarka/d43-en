\v 3 Knowing that Yahweh God \add who created\add* the heavens and the earth is listening, promise that you will not get a wife for my son, Isaac, from the daughters of the Canaan people-group among whom I am now living.
\v 4 Instead, go to my country and to my relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac from among them."

\v 1 Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years, and Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.
\v 2  Abraham said to his servant, the one that was the oldest of his household and that was in charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh
\v 3 and I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.
\v 4 But you will go to my country, and to my relatives, and get a wife for my son Isaac."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **And Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things**  - This means the Lord gave Abraham great riches, including silver, gold, servants, sheep, cattle, camels, and donkeys. Also, God gave Abraham a son, Isaac, to inherit the family wealth.
  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **Put your hand under my thigh**  - The servant's hand would be touching Abraham's genitals, adding a special seriousness to the oath. This action could be a reminder of Abraham's circumcision and his covenant with God. Or, the action may emphasize the need to find a wife for Isaac for the survival of Abraham's line through childbirth. For translation purposes a euphemism may be needed for this phrase. (See: Euphemism)
  * **the God of heaven and the God of the earth**  - this means the God over all created things (See: Merism)
  * **promise that you will not get a wife for my son, Isaac, from the daughters of the Canaan people among whom I am now living **- It was important for Isaac to marry within Abraham's clan, tribe, or family to protect the family's culture and faith in Yahweh alone.
  * **go to my country and to my relatives **- This refers to the family that Abraham left in Haran. See 11:31-32 and 12:1-3.
