\v 16 David therefore implored God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
\v 17 And the elders of his house arose, and stood beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not,
neither did he eat bread with them.
\v 18 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child
was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he listened not to our voice: how
will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!
