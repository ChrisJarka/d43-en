===== Description =====
**Proper Nouns (Names) versus Common Nouns**\\ 
A proper noun is the name of a  specific person, group of people, place, thing,  or idea. Examples of proper nouns are "John Smith," "Kenya," "Christianity" and  "Harvard University". A common noun is a noun that refers in general to a person, place, thing, or idea. Examples of common nouns are "man", "nation",  "religion", and "organization". \\

**Reason this is a translation issue** \\
  - Some names of people and places that you read in the Bible may not be ones that your people use. When you come across such names, you will need to decide how to translate them. 
  - When people read the Bible and see a name  that they have not seen before, they may not know  what kind of thing it is the name of. The translator can add a common noun such as region, country, city, river, ocean  to help the readers.
  - Sometimes people may realize that a name is the name of a person, but they may need some important information about the person in order to understand the passage. So again it can help to add words such as "his brother," "his father," "the ruler, " or the "king." 
 
**Translation Principles**: If in  your culture, a name is simply used to identify a person or place, it may be enough to simply borrow the name. If in your culture the meaning of a name is very important, you may want to translate the meaning of the name.

===== Translation Strategies =====    
  - Borrow the name.  To learn about how to borrow names, see  [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]].
  - Borrow the name and add a common noun to help people know what kind of name it is. 
  - Borrow the name and add a footnote telling the meaning of the name. 
  - Translate the meaning of the name. 
 
**Translations Strategies for people and places that have new or alternate names** 
If a person or place has two names, follow one of these two ways. In either case, it may be necessary to add a footnote that explains that the two names refer to the same person or place: 
  - Use the name that occurs in the particular text you are translating. 
  - Use one name most of the time and the other name only when the text talks about that name or the meaning of that name. 
  - Add a footnote that explains that the two names refer to the same person or place: 
 
  
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====  
1. Borrow the name. 
  * **You went over the Jordan and came to Jericho.**  (Joshua 24:11)
  * **He built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him** (Genesis 3:7) 
 
2. Borrow the name and add a common noun to help people know what kind of name it is. You  will need to decide whether it is more natural in your language to put the name before or after the common noun.  
  * **You went over the Jordan and came to Jericho.**  (Joshua 24:11)
    * "You went over __the Jordan River__ and came to __the city of Jericho__. "
 
  * Go and leave here because Herod wants to kill you.  (Luke 13:31) 
    * Go and leave here because the ruler Herod wants to kill you. 
 
3.  Borrow the name and add a footnote telling the meaning of the name. 
  * **He built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him** (Genesis 3:7)   
    * In a footnote write: "The name El Bethel means "God of Bethel". 

4. Translate the meaning of the name. 
  * **You went over the Jordan and came to Jericho.**  (Joshua 24:11)
    * "You went over the __Going-Down River__ and came to the __Good-Smelling City__" 
    * 
  * **He built an altar there and called the place __God of Bethel__, because there God had revealed himself to him** (Genesis 3:7)   
    * "He built an altar there and called the place __God of the House of God__, because there God had revealed himself to him, (Genesis 3:7)   
 
**People and Places with New or Alternate Names** \\ 

1. Use the name that occurs in the particular text you are translating. \\ 
[[Add example of one verse with Saul and one with Paul  (Or two names of some other person)]]

2. Use one name most of the time and the other name only when the text talks about that name or the meaning of that name.  \\ 
[[Use those two verses above, but put "Paul" and a footnote with the the one that is Saul in the ULB]]
