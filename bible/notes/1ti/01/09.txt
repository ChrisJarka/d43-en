====== 1 Timothy 01:9-11 ======

<usfm>
\v 9 We must remember that God did not give Moses those laws in order \add to condemn\add* righteous people. By those laws he \add condemns people who act as though there were no\add* laws and who refuse to obey \add anyone. He condemns\add* those who do not revere God and those who sin habitually. \add By them he condemns\add* those who refuse to perform rituals that are pleasing to God and who show no respect for religion. \add He condemns\add* those who murder their fathers and who murder their mothers and who murder \add other\add* people.
\v 10 \add He condemns\add* those who are sexually immoral and those who are homosexuals. \add He condemns\add* those who kidnap\f + \ft Or: steal \f* people \add in order to make them slaves\add*. \add He condemns\add* those who lie and those who promise something strongly but do not do what they promised. He condemns every other action that is contrary to our true teaching.
\v 11 This is what we teach people when we tell them the glorious\f + \ft Or: wonderful \f* message about Christ that our awesome God \add has revealed\add* and that he gave to me to teach.

\v 9 We know that the law is not made to control good people, but to control rebellious people and those who do not honor God, for sinners, and disrespectful persons, for murderers and for those who even murder their own parents.
\v 10 It is made also to control homosexuals and all people who practice improper sexual behavior, to control those who steal others and sell them as slaves, to control liars and false witnesses in courts of law, and to stop whatever is different from our good and healthy teaching.
\v 11 All of this agrees with the wonderful good news that God, whom we praise, has taught us, and that he trusts me to announce to others.

<usfm>
\v 9 And we know this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for a lawless and rebellious people, for ungodly people, for sinners and for those who are profane, for those who kill their mothers and fathers, for murderers,
\v 10 for sexually immoral people, for homosexuals, those who kidnap people for slaves, liars, false witnesses, and whatever else is against sound doctrine,
\v 11 according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.
