=== What is the Book of Zephaniah about?===

This book is about Yahweh's coming punishment on the southern kingdom, the kingdom of Judah. It is also about the future restoration of Judah in the [[:en:obe:kt:dayofthelord|day of the Lord]].

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may decided to translate this traditional title "The book of Zephaniah" in a way that is more clear to the readers. They may decide to call it, "The sayings of Zephaniah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]).

=== Who wrote the Book of Zephaniah? ===

Zephaniah is the author of this book, but there are 4 Zephaniah's mentioned in the Old Testament. This Zephaniah was probably the great-grandson of King Hezekiah and the cousin to King Josiah (who lived at the same time as Zephaniah). This  made him royalty. Zephaniah lived in the city of Jerusalem and began his ministry about 70 years after the prophets Isaiah and Micah. Zephaniah’s ministry was during the reign of King Josiah (about 640–621 BC), and just before the ministry of the prophet Jeremiah. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
=== Did the prophecies of Zephaniah occur before Josiah's reforms? ===

Josiah was one of the most important kings of Judah because of the great religious reforms he began. These reforms led the people back to Yahweh. It is probable that Zephaniah's wrote this book prior to the Josiah's reforms. 

=== What was the religious environment of Judah during Zephaniah's ministry? ===

Manasseh was one of the worst kings of Judah and reigned for 50 years. He encouraged the people to worship other [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]]. At this time, the people of Judah  rebelled against Yahweh. 

=== What country is coming to invade Judah? ===

Zephaniah frequently mentions a foreign nation who will come to invade the kingdom of Judah. The name of this nation is never mentioned. Although scholars have debated this point, Babylon is probably the nation referenced in Zephaniah.
