<usfm>
\v 9 To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness; for we have rebelled against him;
\v 10 neither have we obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the
prophets.
\v 11 Yea, all Israel have transgressed your law, even turning aside, that they should not obey your voice: therefore has the
curse been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against
him.
