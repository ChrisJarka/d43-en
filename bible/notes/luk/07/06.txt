\v 6 So Jesus went with them. When he was near the \add officer's\add* house, the officer \add decided that it was not necessary for Jesus to come to his house. So he\add* summoned some friends. He \add told them to\add* go to Jesus and tell him this: "Lord\f + \ft Or: Sir \f*, do not bother to come. \add Because I am a non-Jew\add*, I am not worthy for you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add*, \add a Jew\add*, to come into my house \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add and associate with me\add*.
\v 7 I did not feel worthy to come to you, \add either\add*. But \add please\add* command \add that\add* my servant\add be healed\add*, and he will become well!
\v 8 \add I believe this\add* because, as for me, there are people who have authority over me \add and I obey them\add*. I also have soldiers under my \add authority\add*. When I say to one of them, 'Go!' he goes. When I say to another 'Come!' he comes. When I say to my slave, 'Do this!' he does it. \add And I believe that you speak with a similar kind of authority\add*."

\v 6 So Jesus started going to the officer's house with them. When he was almost there, the officer sent some friends to give this message to  Jesus: "Lord, do not trouble yourself any further, since I am not worthy that you should come into my house.
\v 7 That is why I did not consider myself worthy to come to you myself. But just say the word and I know that my servant will be healed.
\v 8  I know that you can do this because I am a man who is placed under authority, and I also have soldiers who are under my authority. When I say to one of them, 'Go!' he goes, and when I say to another, 'Come!' he comes. When I say to my slave, 'Do this!' he does it."

\v 6 So Jesus continued on his way with them. And when he was  not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to say to him, "Lord, do not trouble yourself, because I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof.
\v 7 For this reason I did not even consider myself to be worthy enough to come to you; but just say a word and my servant will be healed.
\v 8 For I also am a man who is placed under authority and I have soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go'  and he goes, and to another one, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **servant******- the word in the language of origin means "boy," and can refer to a "serving-boy" in the same way that the French word "garcon" means "boy" but refers more often to a "waiter."
    * **just say a word**  - in context, though not explicitly stated in the language of origin, this could be translated, "just give the order."
    * **I say to this one**  - in context, this could be translated, "I tell this one" or also "I order this one," even though the words in the language of origin do not explicitly mean "tell" or "order."
    * **I am not worthy**- this is literally "I am not enough" or "I am not sufficient." The centurion didn't consider himself and his problem enough of a reason for Jesus to come personally. He considered Jesus to be more important of a person than he himself was.
