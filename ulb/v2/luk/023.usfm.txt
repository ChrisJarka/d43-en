\v 1 And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate.
\v 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar,
and saying that he himself is Christ a king.
\v 3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, You sayest.
\v 4 And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.
\v 5 But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from
Galilee even to this place.
\v 6 But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
\v 7 And when he knew that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these
days.
\p
\v 8 Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard
concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.
\v 9 And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
\v 10 And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.
\v 11 And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to
Pilate.
\v 12 And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
\p
\v 13 And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
\v 14 and said to them, You brought to me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined him
before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof you accuse him:
\v 15 no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back to us; and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
\v 16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
\v 17 \f + Many ancient authorities insert v. 17. \fqa Now he must needs release to them at the feast one prisoner.
\f*
\v 18 But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:—
\v 19 one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.
\v 20 And Pilate spoke to them again, desiring to release Jesus;
\v 21 but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.
\v 22 And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil has this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will
therefore chastise him and release him.
\v 23 But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.
\v 24 And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.
\v 25 And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he
delivered up to their will.
\p
\v 26 And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross,
to bear it after Jesus.
\p
\v 27 And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.
\v 28 But Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your
children.
\v 29 For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the
breasts that never gave suck.
\v 30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
\v 31 For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
\p
\v 32 And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
\p
\v 33 And when they came to the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the
right hand and the other on the left.
\v 34 And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast
lots.
\v 35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if
this is the Christ of God, his chosen.
\v 36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,
\v 37 and saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save thyself.
\v 38 And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\p
\v 39 And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Are not you the Christ? save yourself and us.
\v 40 But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Do you not even fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?
\v 41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.
\v 42 And he said, Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.
\v 43 And he said to him, Verily I say to thee, To-day shall you be with me in Paradise.
\p
\v 44 And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,
\v 45 the sun’s light failing: and the veil of the temple was tore in the midst.
\v 46 And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up
the ghost.
\v 47 And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
\v 48 And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they [*]saw the things that were done, returned striking
their breasts.
\v 49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.
\p
\v 50 And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man
\v 51 (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), a man of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for
the kingdom of God:
\v 52 this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
\v 53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had
yet lain.
\v 54 And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
\v 55 And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and [*]saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.
\v 56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.
\p And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
