===== Find my Language =====

This module answers the question: What do I do when I cannot find my language?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_install|Install translationStudio on an Android Device]]

If you do not see your languages in the list of target languages, you can request that your language be added. The best way to submit a request is to send an email to help@door43.org. Another method is to submit a Bug Report. In either case, please provide as much information as you can about the language, such as the local name of the language, and any other names it is known by. Also provide the location(s) where it is used. 
Note that even after requesting a new language, certain approvals are required before it will be added to translationStudio. 

To use the **Report Bug** link to request a new language:

   * In the green bar at the top of the screen, tap on the three dots on the right.
   * In the list of options, tap **Report Bug**.
   * The **Bug Report **  screen opens. Type the name of the language you would like added to translationStudio, other names used to refer to it and the region.  Also include your contact information.
   * Tap **Upload**  to send your request.
