\v 5 If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how can you contend with horses? and yough in a
land of peace you are secure, yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?
\v 6 For even your brethren, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried
aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words to thee.
