====== oak ======

===== Definition: =====

An oak is a tall tree with a large trunk and wide spreading branches that provides good shade. Oak trees were often associated with sacred places in the Old Testament.

  * The trunk of certain oak trees could be as wide around as 6 meters.
  * Oak wood is considered a strong, hard wood. This attribute may have contributed to its religious significance.
  * The seed of an oak tree is called an acorn.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Many translations will have to say "oak tree" rather than just "oak."
  * If oak trees are not known in the receptor area, this could be translated as "oak, which is a large, solid tree like ..." and then give the name of a local tree that has the characteristics of being a large, solid shade tree that has strong wood.
