\v 1 Now I have something to say to the rich people who do not believe in Christ and who oppress you! Listen to me, you rich people! You should weep and wail loudly because you will experience terrible troubles!
\v 2 Your wealth is worthless, as though it were rotted. Your fine clothes are worthless, as though termites had ruined them.
