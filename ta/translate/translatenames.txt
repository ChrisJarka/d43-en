====== How to Translate Names ======

==== Identify Something with a Proper Name: ====

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>A Proper Name (or Proper Noun) is a specific name for someone or something. For example, mountain is a common name–a general term describing a landform. Mount Zion is a specific mountain; therefore, it is a Proper Name.

==== Translate by Copying or Borrowing Words ====

Sometimes the source text uses words not found in the target language. Learn how to borrow or copy words from the source text to the target language on [[:en:ta:translate:translatenames:transliterate|this page]].

===== Translation Suggestions =====

There are many things to keep in mind when translating a name in the Bible:

  * Proper names sometimes reveal information about the person, place, or thing it refers to.
  * Proper names of people may reveal something about the origin or history of the family.
  * Proper names of people may reveal something about a characteristic of the person.
  * Sometimes people and places have more than one name.

There are several ways to handle names when translating the Bible:

  * Copy the proper name from the source language into the target language with no change. Often, this means using the name as it is spelled in the national language translation.
  * Use the name from the source language, but make adjustments to the spelling or add whatever is necessary so that it sounds like the right kind of name in the target language.
  * Pronounce the name as it is pronounced in the source language, and using the target language's spelling system, write the name in a way that people will read it with the source language's pronunciation.
  * Spell the name as it is spelled in the source language, but pronounce the word according to how the target language pronounces those symbols.​
  * Translate the meaning of the name.

If a person or place has two names, follow one of these two strategies:

  * Use the name that occurs in the particular text you are translating.
  * Use one name most of the time and the other name only when the text talks about that name or the meaning of that name.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Luke 1:3**  “Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I also have decided to write a careful account for you, most honorable Theophilus.”

//Honorable describes a person. So honorable points to the fact that Theophilus is the name of a person.//

**Psalms 72:2**  "Jerusalem is where he lives; Mount Zion is his home."

//Here the words Mount Zion refers to the mountain landform.//

**John 21:1**  “Later, Jesus appeared again to the disciples beside the Sea of Galilee.”

//The text refers to the Sea of Galilee. Sea would be your clue that the Sea of Galilee is a body of water.//
