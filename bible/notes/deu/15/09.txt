<usfm>
\v 9 Be sure that you do not say to yourself, 'The year when debts will be canceled is near, \add so I do not want to lend anyone any money now, because he will not need to pay it back when that year comes\add*.' It would be evil to even think that. If you act in an unfriendly way toward a needy fellow Israelite, and give him nothing, he will cry out to Yahweh against you, and \add Yahweh will say that\add* you have sinned \add by not helping that person\add*.
\v 10 Give freely to poor people and give generously [IDI].

\v 9 Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nought; and he cry to Jehovah against thee, and it be sin to thee.
\v 10 You shall surely give him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him; because that for this thing Jehovah your God will bless you in all your work, and in all that you put your hand unto.
