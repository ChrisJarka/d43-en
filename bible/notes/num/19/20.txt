<usfm>
\v 20 If those who have become unacceptable to me do not become acceptable to me again by doing this, they will no longer belong to the Israelite people, because they have defiled my Sacred Tent. They did not sprinkle on themselves the water that removes the guilt of their sins, so they remain unacceptable to me.
\v 21 That is a law for the Israelite people that will never be changed. Those who sprinkle that water on themselves must then wash their clothes. And anyone who touches that water which removes guilt for sins will remain unacceptable to God until that evening.
\p
\v 22 Anything and any person whom someone who has become unacceptable to me has touched will remain unacceptable to me until that evening."

\v 20 But the man who remains unclean and will not purify himself, that man must be cut off from the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh. The water for impurity has not been sprinkled upon him and he is unclean.
\v 21 This will be an ongoing statute for them. He who sprinkles the water for impurity will wash his clothes and he who touches the water for impurity will be unclean until evening.
\v 22 And whatever the unclean person touches will be unclean and the person who touches it will be unclean until evening.
