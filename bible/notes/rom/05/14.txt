\v 14 But we know that from the time when Adam lived until the time when Moses lived, all people sinned, and they died as a consequence . Even people who sinned differently from the way Adam sinned, died. Adam's sin affected all people, just like what Christ did, the one who came later, can affect all people.
\v 15 But the results of God's erasing the record of our sins as a gift to us are not like the results of Adam's sinning. The result of one man, Adam, sinning was that many people have died. But it is certain, however, that many people have abundantly experienced God's acting kindly toward them in a way they did not deserve.

\v 14 Nevertheless death ruled from Adam until Moses, even upon those who did not sin like Adamâ€™s disobedience, who is a figure of him who was to come.

\v 15 But even so the free gift is not like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.
