===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **judges**  - This term is derived from the idea of justice and can be translated using the appropriate term for one who sees that people act justly, especially one who sees that wrongs are made right and settles disputes. This is different from a king, who is simply a man who exercises political power. The "judges" at this time were community leaders or rulers raised up by God and who often sent soldiers into battle against the enemies of Israel.
  * **ruled**  - This term comes from the same root as "judges" and could be translated using the appropriate term for settling disputes.
  * **Elimelech**  - This man's name means "my God is king."
  * **Naomi**  - This woman's name means "my delight." The meaning of her name becomes important in 1:20.
  * **Mahlon**  - This man's name means "sick" or "sickly."
  * **Chilion**  - This man's name means "pining" or "thinness or weakness because of sadness or loss."
  * **Bethelem of Judah**
 - This village called Bethlehem was located in the tribal territory of Judah. There was another Bethlehem known in the Bible located in the tribal territory of Zebulun (Joshua 19:15).
