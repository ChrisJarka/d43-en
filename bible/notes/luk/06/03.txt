\v 4 David entered the tabernacle and asked for some food. The priest gave him the bread that was dedicated to God and that only they were allowed to eat. It was permitted in one of Moses' laws that only the priests could eat that bread. But even though David was not a priest, he ate some, and gave some to the men who were with him. And God did not consider that what David did was wrong!"
\v 5 Jesus also said to them, "I am the one who came from heaven, so I have the authority to determine what is right for my disciples to do on the Sabbath!"
