===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, say to you, \add my people\add*: People say that only a small amount of food is produced on your mountains, and as a result your children die from hunger.
\v 14 Therefore, I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that no longer will that happen.
\v 15 No longer will the people of other nations ridicule you; no longer will they laugh at you; no longer will \add the armies of\add* other nations conquer you. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have declared that it will happen.'~"

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 I, Yahweh the Lord, am telling you mountains this: It is true that people have said they could not grow many crops on you, and so they died from hunger.
\v 14 But that will no longer happen.
\v 15 No longer will the other people-groups ridicule you mountains. No longer will they laugh at you; no longer will their armies conquer you. I, the Lord Yahweh, am telling you this myself.'"

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 The Lord Yahweh says this: Because they are saying to you, “You devour men, and your nation has become bereaved of children,”
\v 14 therefore you will not consume people any longer, and you will no longer bereave your nation. This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 15 Nor will I allow you to hear the insults of the nations any longer; you will no longer have to bear the shame of the peoples or cause your nation to stagger and fall.' This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues Yahweh's message to the mountains of Israel.

  * **they are saying to you** - "other nations are saying to you mountains"
  * **You devour men** - "You cause many people to die"
  * **your nation has become bereaved of children** - "and you cause your people to have no children" or "you cause your nation's children to die." It is implied that the mountains do this by not growing good crops. This can be made explicit as in the UDB. See ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
  * **Nor will I allow you to hear the insults of the nations any longer** - AT: "I will no longer allow the other nations to insult you."
  * **you will no longer have to bear the shame of the peoples** - "the peoples will no longer cause you to feel ashamed"
  * **or cause your nation to stagger and fall** - "and you will not make your people stumble anymore"
  * **stagger** - the way people walk when they are so tired that they are about to fall
