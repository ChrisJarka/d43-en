\v 4 Do not be like your fathers to whom the prophets cried out previously, saying, "Thus says Yahweh of hosts;
turn from your evil ways and wicked practices!" but they would not hear and did not pay attention to me."--this is Yahweh's declaration.
\v 5 "Your fathers, where are they?", and the prophets, are they here forever?
\v 6 But my words and my statutes that I commanded my servants the prophets, have they not overtaken your fathers so they might repent and say,
'Yahweh of hosts's plans are done according to his word and practice, and he has done them.'
