\v 6 I was very angry when I heard these things that they were complaining about.
\v 7 So I thought about what I could do about it. I told the leaders and officials, "You are charging interest to your own relatives \add when they borrow money from you\add*!" Then I called together a large group of people,
\v 8 and I said to them, "Some of our Jewish relatives have been forced to sell themselves to become slaves of people who have come from other countries. As much as we have been able to, we have been buying them back. But now you are forcing your own relatives to sell themselves to you, their fellow Jews!" \add When I said that to\add* them, they were silent. There was nothing that they could say \add because they knew that what I said was true\add*.

\v 6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
\v 7 Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, You exact usury, every one
of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.
\v 8 And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold to the nations; and would
you even sell your brethren, and should they be sold to us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.
