\v 16 Verily, verily, I say to you, A servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that
sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
\v 18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats my bread
lifted up his heel against me.
