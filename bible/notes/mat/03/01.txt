\v 1 While Jesus was still in the town of Nazareth, John, whom the people called the Baptizer, went to a desolate place in the province of Judea.
He was preaching to the people who came there.
\v 2  He kept saying, "You must stop sinning, because God will soon begin to rule over people, and he will reject you if you do not stop sinning."
\v 3 When John began preaching, then came true what Isaiah the prophet had said long ago. He said, 
\pi "In the wilderness people hear someone shouting to anyone who comes,
\pi Get ready to receive the Lord when he comes!
\pi Get everything ready for him!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

this section takes place many years later when John the Baptist was an adult and began to preach.

  * **make his paths straightâ€‹**  - "his" is referring to the person who is being told to "Make ready the way of the Lord" and that person needs to walk in godly paths.
