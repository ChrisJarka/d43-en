\v 13 God viewed you as being dead, because you has sinned against him, and because you were not Jews, so you did not worship him. But he made you come alive together with Christ; he forgave us of all our sins.
\v 14 God cancelled the condemnation we deserve for our sins, as if all of our sins that condemn each of us were listed on a written document, and then Jesus took away the record of our sins from us and God nailed that document to the cross, where Jesus died to forgive us for those sins forever.
\v 15 God defeated the evil angelic spirit beings who rule, and he publicly exposed their defeat. He triumphed over them because of what Christ accomplished through the cross.
