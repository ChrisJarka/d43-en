<usfm>
\v 3 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
\v 4 They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceaseth to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough, until it be leavened.
\v 5 On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers.
