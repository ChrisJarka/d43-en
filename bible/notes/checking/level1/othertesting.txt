====== Other Checking Methods ======

A number of other checking methods may also be used to ensure that the translation is easy to read and sounds natural to the listeners.

**Retell Method: ** You, the translator can read a few verses and ask someone else to retell what was said. This helps to check the clarity and naturalness of the translation and offers alternate ways of saying the same thing.

**Reading Method:** Someone other than you, the translator, should read a portion of the translation while you take notes where the pauses and mistakes occur. This will show how easy or how difficult it is to read and understand the translation.

**Offer Alternate translations:** In areas where you are not sure of the best way to express a word or phrase, ask for an alternative translation or offer a choice between two variations.

**Reviewer Input:** Let others whom you respect read your translation. Ask them to take notes and tell you where it might be improved. Look for better word choices, natural expressions, and even spelling adjustments.

**Discussion Groups:** Ask people to read the translation aloud and to ask questions for clarification. Pay attention to the words they use, since alternate words and expressions come up when someone is trying to make sense of a difficult point.
