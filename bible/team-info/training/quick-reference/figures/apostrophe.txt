====== Apostrophe ======


===== Description =====

In apostrophe, a speaker turns his attention from the people he is speaking to and makes an exclamation to someone who is not there with them. He could even speak to an imaginary person or a thing or idea as if it were a person (See [[:en:ta:translate:personification|Personification]].)
