\v 3 And if, \add as some of you say, some people are\add* not able to understand the message \add that we teach about Christ, it is not because we do not teach it clearly\add*. It is because those people \add do not want to believe it\add*. They are on the road to eternal death.
\v 4 \add Satan, who is\add* the one \add who rules\add* this world, controls the thoughts of those unbelievers. He prevents them from understanding the message about how wonderful Christ is. \add They are not able to understand that\add* Jesus is like God \add in every way\add*.

\v 3 But if our good news is hidden, it has been hidden to the ones that are perishing:
\v 4 in their case, the god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds so they are not able to see the light of the good news of the glory of
Christ, who is the physical representation of God.
