\v 25 Then I will make a covenant of peace with them and remove the wicked living things from the land, so they will dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forests.
\v 26 I will also make them and the surroundings of my hill a blessing, for I will send out showers in their time. These will be showers of blessing!
\v 27 Then the tree of the field will produce its fruit and the earth will yield its produce, and they will be secure in their land; then they will know that I am Yahweh when I break the bars of the yoke and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them.
