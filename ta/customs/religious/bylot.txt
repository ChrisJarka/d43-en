=====By Lot=====

“by lot” means a random choice.  Every culture has a way of picking people or items by an unsystematic or casual method.  

Americans can draw papers out of a bowl or sing a 'counting-out rhymes' such as “eeny, meeny, miny, moe.”  Another method is to draw straws which means a collection of small items which are identical except one which is shorter. 

The Jewish method as explained by a historian named Maimonides states that the group of priests would stand in a circle agree upon a number.  All the men would then hold up his fingers (not including the thumb.)  Then the leader of the Priests would take the mitre off the head of one of the men and start counting the number of fingers that each man would hold up.

When the number was reached by counting fingers then that group of priests would do one of these tasks:

-- slay the animal sacrifices
-- sprinkle the blood
-- remove the ashes from the innermost altar
-- remove the ashes from the candlestick and trims the lamps;
-- bring up the parts of the animal sacrifice to the altar
