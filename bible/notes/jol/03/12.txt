===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **wake themselves up** - This is saying the people of the nations should become excited for war.  Compared to this level of excitement, being awake is compared to being asleep. "become ready for action" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
    * **will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations** - God compares the defeat of the other armies to a leader judging what punishment a criminal deserves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe**  - This compares soldiers being killed and falling over to cutting down grain when it is ready to be used for food. 
    * **Come, crush the grapes, for the winepress is full, the vats overflow**  - The wicked will be crushed (put under great pressure), just as grapes are crushed to make wine.  The pressure will be applied until the wine containers are full.
    * **their wickedness is enormous**  - "they are very wicked" or "their wickedness is great".
