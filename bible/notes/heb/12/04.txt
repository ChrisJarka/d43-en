\v 4 While you have struggled against \add being tempted to\add* sin, you have not yet bled \add and died because of resisting evil, as Jesus did\add*.
\v 5 Do not forget \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* these words \add that Solomon spoke to his son, that are the same as God\add* would exhort you as his children:
\q My child, pay attention \f + \ft litotes \f* when the Lord is disciplining you,
\q and do not be discouraged when the Lord punishes you \f + \ft doublet \f*,
\q
\v 6 because it is everyone whom he loves whom the Lord disciplines,
\q and he punishes everyone whom he accepts as his child.

\v 4 While you have struggled against being tempted to sin, you have not yet bled and died because of resisting evil, as Jesus did.
\v 5 Do not forget these words that Solomon spoke to his son, which are the same with which God encourages you as his children:
\q "My son, pay attention when the Lord is disciplining you,
\q and do not be discouraged when the Lord punishes you,
\q
\v 6 because everyone the Lord loves he also disciplines,
\q and he severely corrects everyone he calls his own."

\p
\v 4 You have not yet resisted or struggled against sin to the 
point of losing blood.
\v 5 And you have forgotten the encouragement that instructs you as sons:
\q "My son, do not lightly regard the discipline of the Lord,
\q nor lose heart when you are corrected by him."
\q
\v 6 For the Lord disciplines anyone whom he loves,
\q and he punishes every son whom he receives.
