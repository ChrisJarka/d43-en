===== Networking Ideas =====

Book of Jonah – 4 chapters (possibly 1 or 2 Thessalonians)

1. Purpose of Notes

2. Overview of structure:

  * Reviewer
  * tN Manager
  * Teams with team leads

3. Overview of 5 things to look for (possible practice activity):

  * **Words or phrases**  that are difficult to understand.
  * **Implicit information**  - This is information that the speaker did not actually say, but the original audience would have understood.
  * **Figures of speech**  such as rhetorical questions, metaphors, similes that may be hard for other languages to understand.
  * **Pronouns**  that might not be easy to understand who or what it refers to in the text.
  * **Verbal Nouns**  that may be difficult to translate into other languages. For example, a language may not have a noun such as ‘forgiveness’, but it may have a verb for ‘forgive.’
4. Walk through some chunks together on the first day.

5. Show examples of notes. Ask which notes look good, bad, need work.

6. Review notes done each night and give feedback each day. Also h<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>ave Managers checking and Reviewers reviewing work day to day.</font>

7. Managers create a user-friendly checklist for them and the Team Leads to check the notes.

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>8. Coordination of teams conversation. (Team members don't have to be good at everything).</font>
