====== BI Master Metaphorical Patterns ======

===== Description =====





These patterns often overlay other metaphorical patterns, so they can be called master patterns.

=== ABSTRACT CONCEPTS are represented as PERSONS (Personification) ===

**they will suck the abundance of the seas**  (Check wording in ULB)  (Deuteronomy 33:19)
The seas refers to trade with countries along the seas. The seas (or trade) is represented as a mother

drink the milk of the nations and will nurse the breasts of kings (Isaiah 60:16)

by grace you have been saved. (nouns that encode concepts that are not verbal - maybe be adjectival, adverbial, logical relationship ("concession" "relationship")

(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])


=== CONCRETE CONCEPTS ARE PERSONS (Personification) ===

> **Then let the trees in the forest shout for joy before Yahweh,** (1 Chronicles 16:33 ULB)

In the example above, trees are spoken of as if they were people and could shout for joy. 

(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])



=== NON-NOMINAL ENTITIES ARE NOMINAL ENTITIES (Abstract nouns) ===
Concepts that are inherently non-nouns are treated both conceptually and in the grammar as nouns.

>**Above all these things, have __love__, which is the __bond__ of __perfection__.** (Colossians 3:14 ULB)

In the example above, "love" and "bond" are actions, which are normally represented by verbs. But here they are treated as things and are represented by nouns. "Perfection" refers to a quality, and here it describes how something is done. This could be represented by an adverb, but here it is treated as a noun.  
  * "Above all these things, love one another, and doing this will bond you together perfectly."

=== PAST TENSE is used to represent events in FUTURE TIME (in predictive prophecy) ===

This is often done in prophecy that tells about things that will happen in the future.
