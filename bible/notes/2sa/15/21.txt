\v 21 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord
the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will your servant be.
\v 22 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones
that were with him.

Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
