\q
\v 24 One who hates, disquises himself with his lips,
\q and he lays up deceit within him;
\q
\v 25 he will speak graciously; do not believe him; 
\q for there are seven abominations in his heart:
\q
\v 26 hatred hides itself with deception, 
\q and his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
