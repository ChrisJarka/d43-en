<usfm>
\v 6 You began to believe in Christ Jesus the Lord by trusting in him, so also live by trusting him.
\v 7 You should rely completely on Christ Jesus the Lord, just like a tree spreads its roots deep into the ground. You should let God teach you to trust Christ very much, like men build a house on a good foundation. And you should always give thanks to God.
