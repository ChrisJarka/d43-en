<usfm>
\q
\v 10 So you, my servant Jacob, do not fear—this is Yahweh's declaration—and do not be dismayed, Israel.
\q For see, I am about to bring you back from far away, and your descendants from the land of captivity.
\q Jacob will return and be at peace; he will be secure, and there will be no more terror.
\q
\v 11 For I am with you—this is Yahweh's declaration—to save you. Then I will bring a complete end
\q to all the nations where I have scattered you. But I will certainly not put an end to you,
\q though I discipline you justly and will certainly not leave you unpunished.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **my servant Jacob ... Israel** - "Jacob" and "Israel" are the two names of the ancestor of the Israelites, and these names are metonyms for the Israelites. AT: "descendants of Jacob ... you Israelite people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **and do not be dismayed** - "and do not be discouraged"
  * **For see, I am** - "Listen carefully while I tell you why: I am"
  * **from the land of captivity** - The abstract noun "captivity" can be translated using the noun "captive." AT: "from the place where they were captives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Jacob will return ... he will be secure** - Jacob's name is a metonym for his descendants. Yahweh speaks to Jacob as if he were speaking to another person. You may need to make explicit to where Jacob will return. AT: "Jacob will return to his own land ... he will be secure" or "The descendants of Jacob will return ... they will be secure" or "You descendants of Jacob will return ... you will be secure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **secure** - "safe"
  * **where I have scattered you** - "where I have sent you"
  * **But I will certainly not put an end to you** - "But I will not completely destroy you" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **and will certainly not leave you unpunished** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "and will certainly punish you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
