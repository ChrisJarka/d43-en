===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the meaning of "flesh?" ===

Paul frequently uses the terms "flesh" or "fleshly" to refer to Christians who follow their own sinful desires. Despite the imagery, it is not the physical world which is evil. Paul also describes Christians who live [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteously]] as "spiritual" people because they follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit. 

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Corinthians? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of manuscripts that many believe are more accurate. The follow are the most significant issues in the Book of 1 Corinthians:\\

  * "and in your spirit, which are God's." (6:20) 
  * "though not being myself under the law" (9:20) (so noted in ULB **by parentheses ?**)

Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to the Book of 1 Corinthians.
