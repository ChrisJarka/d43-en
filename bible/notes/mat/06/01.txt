====== Matthew 06:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 1 "When you do your good deeds, make certain that you do not do them when other people are watching so that they may see you \add and think highly of you\add*. If \add you do good deeds merely in order that other people may think highly of you, God\add*, your Father who is in heaven, will not give you any reward. \v 2 So, whenever you give something to the poor, do not \add announce it as people announce something that they want other people to know about\add* by playing a \add fanfare\add* on a trumpet \f + \ft metaphor \f*. That is what the hypocrites do in the synagogues\f + \ft Or: in the Jewish meeting places \f* and on the main roads in order that people might \add see what they do and\add* praise them. Keep this in mind: \add People praise those hypocrites\add*, \add but\add* that is the \add only\add* reward they will receive! </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 1 "When you do good deeds, make certain that you do not do them when other people are watching. Do not let them see you and think highly of you. If you do good deeds merely in order that other people may think highly of you, God, your Father who is in heaven, will not give you any reward. \v 2 So whenever you give something to the poor, do not make other people notice it, as they would notice someone playing a trumpet. That is what the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the main roads in order that people might praise them. Keep in mind that people praise those hypocrites, but that is the only reward the hypocrites will receive! </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \c 6 \p \v 1 Take heed that you do not do your acts of righteousness before people, to be seen by them, or else you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. \v 2 So when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have the praise of people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward. </usfm>
