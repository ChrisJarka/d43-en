\v 5 Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of
Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put
the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
\v 6 Do therefore according to your wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.
