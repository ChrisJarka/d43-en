<usfm>
\v 4 Look, you fast to quarrel and fight, and to hit with your angry fist: this kind of fasting of yours will not make
your voice  heard in heaven.
\v 5 Is this really the kind of  fast that I want? a day for  man to humble himself,  it to bow down his head like a reed, and to
spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Do you really call this a fast, and a day that pleases Yawah?
