<usfm>
\v 8 Although I am the least worthy of all God's people, God has enabled me by his kindness and mercy to proclaim to non-Jews the Good News about what Christ has done for us, which is so much no one can describe it all.
\v 9 My mission is to explain to everyone, as if lighting a light, what God's plan is, the mystery which God has kept hidden from the time when he created everything.

\v 8 To me this gift was given, although I am less than the lowest of those set apart for God, to proclaim to the Gentiles the gospel of the infinite riches of Christ
