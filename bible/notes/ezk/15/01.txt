\v 1 And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?
\v 3 Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?

it profitable for any work?
