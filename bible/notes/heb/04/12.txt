<usfm>
\v 12 For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword.  And it pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.
\v 13 And there is no creature that is hidden in his sight. But all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him to whom we are accountable.
