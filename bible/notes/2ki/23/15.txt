\v 15 Furthermore, he commanded them to tear down the place of worship at Bethel which had been built by King Jeroboam \add #1\add*, the king who persuaded the people of Israel to sin. They tore down the altar. Then they broke its stones into pieces and pounded them to become powder. They also burned the statue \add of the goddess\add* Asherah.
\v 16 Then Josiah looked around and saw some tombs there on the hill. He commanded his men to take the bones out of those tombs and burn them on the altar. By doing that, he desecrated the altar. That was what a prophet had predicted many years before when Jeroboam \add #1\add* was standing close to that altar at a festival.
\p Then Josiah looked up and saw the tomb of the prophet who had predicted that.

\v 15 And also Josiah broke down  the altar that was at Bethel and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had constructed. He burned the altar high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah pole.
\v 16 As Josiah looked over the area he noticed the sepulchres that were there on the hillside. He commanded that the bones be removed from out of the sepulchres and burned upon the altar, which defiled it, according to the word of Yahweh which the man of God
proclaimed, who spoke these things.
