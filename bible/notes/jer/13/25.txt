<usfm>
\v 25 This is your lot, the portion measured to you from me, says Jehovah; because you have forgotten me, and trusted in
falsehood.
\v 26 Therefore will I also uncover your skirts upon your face, and your shame shall appear.
\v 27 I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries, and your neighings, the lewdness of your whoredom, on the hills in
the field. Woe to thee, O Jerusalem! you will not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?
</usfm>
