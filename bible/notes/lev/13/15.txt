\v 15 And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.
\v 16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed to white, then he shall come to the priest;
\v 17 and the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean that has the plague: he is clean.
