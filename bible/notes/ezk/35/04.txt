\v 4 I will make your cities a ruin and you yourself will be desolate, then you will know that I am Yahweh!
\v 5 Because you have had perpetual enmity and delivered the sons of Israel into the hands of the sword in the time of their distress, in the time their iniquity put to an end;
\v 6 therefore, as I live!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—that I will prepare you for blood, and blood will pursue you! Since you did not hate blood, blood will pursue you!
