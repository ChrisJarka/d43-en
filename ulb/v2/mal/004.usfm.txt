\c 4

\v 1 For, behold, the day cometh, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and all that work wickedness, shall be stubble;
and the day that comes shall burn them up, says Jehovah of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
\v 2 But to you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings; and you shall go forth, and
gambol as calves of the stall.
\v 3 And you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make, says
Jehovah of hosts.

\v 4 Remember you the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.
\v 5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Jehovah come.
\v 6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers; lest I come
and strike the earth with a curse.
