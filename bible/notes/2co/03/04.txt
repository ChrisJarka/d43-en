\v 4 I \add can very\add* confidently \add write these things about the work that Silas, Timothy, and I did among you, because God knows that what I write is true. We\f + \ft exclusive \f* are true workers\add* for God\add because of what\add* Christ \add has done for us\add*.
\v 5 We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, by ourselves, do not have the ability \add to do this work\add*. None of us \add apostles\add* can say, "\add I have changed the lives of these people\add*." God is the one \add who has given us this ability\add*.
\v 6 He is the one who enables us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* to be his messengers. \add He has enabled us to tell people the message\add* about the new agreement \add that he is making with them\add*. This is not a \add message about obeying all the\add* written laws \add of his old agreement that he made with the Jewish people\add*. Instead, \add it is a message about God giving us his\add* Spirit. \add Previously, God condemned people to be\add* separated from him forever \add if they did not obey his laws\add*. But by \add God's new agreement\add* his Spirit enables people to live \add eternally\add*.

\v 4 This is a wonderful work that is done in you, and we are confident in this work is effective because Christ helps us, and all that is done gives praise to God.
\v 5 This great work that is done has nothing to do with our competency or abilites. We are not worth anything and our efforts amount to nothing in themselves. But what we do has great worth because it is not we who do it but God. God makes our work worthy and eternally important.
\v 6 God made us his servants—we who did not qualify to serve God in any way—but God made us servants of the new covenant, a message not based only on what is written in the law and rules, but based on the work of the Spirit. For rules and regulations cannot give life to anyone; it is only the Spirit that gives new life.

\v 4 And this is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.
\v 5Not that we are worthy in ourselves, to consider anything as coming from us, but our worthiness is from God;
\v 6 who also made us worthy to be ministry of a new covenant, not of what is written, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
