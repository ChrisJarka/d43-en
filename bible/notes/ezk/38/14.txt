\v 14 Therefore, you human, prophesy about Gog and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: At that time, when my people of Israel are living safely, you will certainly think about that.
\v 15 So you will come from your place far north \add of Israel\add*, with the armies of many other nations, all riding horses, a huge army.
\v 16 You will march toward my Israelite people, and your soldiers will cover the land like a huge cloud. Gog, I will bring your army to attack the country that belongs to me, but \add what I do\add* for you will show the people of other nations that I am holy.

\v 14 Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to God, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh:
\q In that day when my people Israel dwells securely, will you not know it?
\q
\v 15 Yet you go from your place far away to the north along with a great people,
\q all of them riding on horses, a great company and a large army?
\q
\v 16 And you go up against my people Israel like cloud to cover the land?
\q It will be in the latter days I will bring you against my land
\q So that the nations might know me when I sanctify you before their eyes, Gog.’
