=== Act:07:22 ===

"Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works."

  * **all the learning of the Egyptians**  - This is an exaggeration for "many things that the Egyptians knew." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hyperbole|Hyperbole]])

=== Tit:01:12 ===

"One of them, a wise man of theirs, said, 'Cretans are unceasing liars, bad and dangerous animals, lazy bellies.'"

  * **Cretans are unceasing liars**  - "Cretans are lying all the time" or "Cretans never stop lying." The is an exaggeration. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
