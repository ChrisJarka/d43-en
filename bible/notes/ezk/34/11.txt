\v 13 I will bring them back from those countries and gather them together again in their own land. \add Because it is as though they are my sheep\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add it is as though\add* I will enable them to find good pastureland on the hills of Israel, and in the ravines, and in the villages of Israel.

\v 11 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: "Behold! I myself will seek out my flock and I will look after them,
\v 12 like a shepherd seeking his flock on the day he is within the midst of his scattered flock. Thus I will seek my flock, and I will deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on the day of clouds and darkness.
\v 13 Then I will bring them out from among the peoples; I will gather them from the lands and bring them to your land. I will put them in pastures on the mountainsides of Israel by the streams and in every settlement in the land.
