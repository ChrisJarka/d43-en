\v 5 In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the
wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
\v 6 Then the king’s countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins were loosed,
and his knees struck one against another.
