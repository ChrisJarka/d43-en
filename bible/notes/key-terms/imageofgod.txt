People were created in the "image of God," When this phrase is applied to Jesus, it means that he is God himself.

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>God created human beings "in his image," that is, "in his likeness." This means that people have certain characteristics that reflect the image of God, such as the ability to feel emotion, the ability to reason and communicate, and a spirit that lives eternally.</font>

  * In the New Testament, it says that Jesus is the "image of the invisible God" and that he is the "exact representation of his being." In this context, "image of" could be translated as "exact likeness of" or "same essence as."
  * Unlike human beings, Jesus was not created in the image of God; rather, he has always been the image of God, which means he is the same essence and being as God.
