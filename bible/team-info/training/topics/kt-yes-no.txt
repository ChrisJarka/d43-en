====== Is It a Key Term? ======

Why are some terms labeled as key terms, and other are not? This decision is made by the Notes teams, and is actually more art than science. The general principles for something becoming a key term are:

  * the term is so biblically or theologically significant that it needs more than a sentence or two in the notes to explain how to translate it accurately
  * the term appears often in the Bible, so it is more efficient to link to another page than to keep repeating the explanation in the notes
