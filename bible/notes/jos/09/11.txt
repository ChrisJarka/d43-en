\v 11 Our elders and all the people of our country said to us, 'Take supplies with you for the journey,
go to meet them, and say to them we are your servants.  Make a treaty with us.'
\v 12 This is the bread we took for our supplies.  It was fresh from our houses on the day we left to come to you.  Look,
it is dry and moldy.
\v 13 These are the wine-skins we filled.  They were new.  Look, they are torn.  These are our clothes and shoes.  They have
become old and wornout because of the long journey."
