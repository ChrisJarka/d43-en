  * [[:en:obe:other:leprosy|leper, leprosy]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:lord|Lord]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins an account of Jesus miraculously healing several people.

  * **him ** - The pronoun "him" refers to Jesus
  * **if you are willing ** - "if you want to" or "if you desire." The leper believes that Jesus has the power to heal him if Jesus wants to.
  * **you can make me clean** - "you can heal me.". This conveys the idea of physical, but also spiritual healing.
  * **immediately** - "right away"
  * **cleansed** - "purified" or "healed"
  * **he was cleansed** - "Jesus cleansed the leper." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:active|Active or Passive]])
