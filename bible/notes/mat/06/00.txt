======  Matthew 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and Formatting ===

Matthew 6 continues Jesus' extended teaching known as The Sermon on the Mount. 

The translator may wish to set apart the prayer in 6:9-11 by using indentation. Since this chapter quickly shifts from one topic to another, it is possible to use a line of space between topic to distinguish between them more easily.

=== The function of this chapter ===

== The Lord's Prayer ==

This is not a prayer to be recited over and over again, although this prayer can be used in that way. Instead, it provides a model for how Christians are to pray.
