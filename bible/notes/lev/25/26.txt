\v 26 However, if a man has no one to buy the land for him, and he himself prospers again and saves enough money to buy that land back,
\v 27 he must calculate how many years there will be until the next Year of Celebration. Then he must pay to the man who bought the land the money that he would have earned by continuing to grow crops on that land for those years.
\v 28 But if the original owner does not have any money to buy the land that he sold, it will continue to belong to the man who bought it, until the next Year of Celebration. In that year it must be returned to its original owner, and he will be able to live on it again.

\v 26 If a man has no relative to redeem his property, but he has prospered and has the ability to redeem it, 
\v 27 then he may calculate the years since the land was sold and repay the balance to the man to whom he sold it. Then he may return to his property.
\v 28 But if he is not able to get the land back for himself, then the land he has sold will remain in the ownership of the one who bought it until the year of jubilee. During the jubilee the land will be returned, and the original owner will return to his property.
