===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God continues speaking to Jeremiah about Israel. 

  * **I will restore** - The word "I" refers to Yahweh.
  * **Israel to his homeland ... he will be satisfied** - This refers collectively to all the people of Israel. AT: "the people of Israel to their homeland ... they will be satisfied" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **he will graze on Carmel and Bashan** - Israel is spoken of as if they were sheep that eat grass. AT: "they will eat food that grows in Carmel and Bashan" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **In those days and at that time** - These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that future time. Translate this in as [[:en:bible:notes:jer:33:14|33:15]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **iniquity will be looked for in Israel, but none will be found. I will inquire about the sins of Judah, but none will be found** - These two lines mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize that Yahweh will completely forgive the sins of the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **iniquity will be looked for in Israel, but none will be found** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will look for iniquity in the people of Israel, but will not find any" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **that I spare** - They will escape the destruction of Babylon. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "that I allow to escape the destruction of Babylon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
