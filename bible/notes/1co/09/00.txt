====== 1 Corinthians 09 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. Many other English translations indent the line of 9:9, which is a quotation from the Old Testament. 

Paul defends himself from the charge of just wanting money from the church. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

People have accused Paul of just wanting money from the Church. Paul answers that he has a perfect right to get money from the Church because even the Old Testament taught that those who worked should get their living from their work. But he and Barnabas had never used that right but had earned their own living. He tried to be as alike to people he is trying to win to the Lord, whether they kept the Law of Moses or not or are weak; because he wanted to bring them all to Christ. He always worked hard like an athlete in training for an eternal reward.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]: "Run the race" meaning to work hard to reach a goal, 
"receive a wreath" means to win, 
"make a slave of his body" means make it do what was hard for it.
