=== What is Book of Isaiah about? ===

Isaiah, who lived in Jerusalem, warned his people about the coming destruction of their nation Israel. The book records many Isaiah's [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophecies]]. In a difficult time, Isaiah gave the nation hope in the [[:en:obe:kt:redeem|redemption]] that the future [[:en:obe:kt:christ|messiah]] would bring.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

"The Book of Isaiah" may also be called the "The book about Isaiah" or "The Sayings of Isaiah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== When did the prophet Isaiah live? ===

The prophet Isaiah wrote down the prophecies in this book about 740–700 BC, when the Assyrian Empire was increasing in power. Isaiah transmitted prophecies from God to the people of Judah during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, and Manasseh. The period of Isaiah’s work is also reflected in 2 Kings 19–20. When he was alive, Babylon was not a major force. However, one hundred years later, Babylon became the dominant power in the region.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Did Isaiah teach that the messiah of Israel was to be a conquering king or a suffering servant? ===

While most of Israel expected the Messiah to be a conquering king, Isaiah does explain that the Messiah will also be a servant of the Lord who suffers for the sins of the people. The messiah will offer both spiritual and physical deliverance but this does not mean they will happen at the same time.

=== What are the [[:en:obe:kt:lastday|last days]]? ===

The book of Isaiah is one of the first books to deal with the topic of the last days or the end times. Isaiah explains that there will be a future kingdom of Israel, centered around Jerusalem, where the world will come to learn about and worship Yahweh. There will also be peace in the world.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the meaning of the term "Israel"? ===

"Israel" is used in many different ways in Scripture. The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel.  This people group is also the [[:en:obe:other:israel|nation of Israel]]. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, which is a reference to the "[[:en:obe:other:kingdomofisrael|kingdom of Israel]]." Isaiah references both the northern kingdom of Israel and the whole nation of Israel as "Israel".

=== How do I translate a book of prophecy? ===

A book of prophecy is considerably different than history or narrative. Isaiah often convicts his reader of their sin and their need to fear or worship Yahweh. He does this using poetic language and unique vocabulary. Occasionally, he gives a prophecy without mentioning the subject. The reader may or may not immediately understand who the prophecy is about. Chapter 53 is a prophecy about the Messiah, but Isaiah never explicitly mentions the Messiah.
