===== What is Translation =====

For our purposes, translation is a process performed between different languages that involves a person (the translator) changing a text from one language (the source language) into a different language (the target language).

There are basically two kinds of translations: literal and dynamic. 
  * Very literal translations focus on representing words in the source language wih words in the target language that have similar basic meanings. They also use phrases that have similar structures to the phrases in the source language.   
  * Dynamic translations focus on representing the meaning of the source language sentence in its context, and will use whatever words and phrase structures are most appropriate to convey that meaning in the target language.
