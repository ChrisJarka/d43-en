\v 15 What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, and I will also sing with my mind.
\v 16 Otherwise if you praise God with the spirit, how will someone who fills the place of the unlearned say "Amen" at your thanksgiving, if he does not know what you are saying?
