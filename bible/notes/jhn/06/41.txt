===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The Jewish leaders interrupt Jesus as he is speaking to the crowd.

  * **grumbled** - talked unhappily
  * **I am the bread** - Here "bread" is a metaphor that points to Jesus who is the one who gives spiritual life just as bread sustains physical life. AT: "I am the one who is like true bread" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) You can translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:06:35|6:35]].
  * **Is not this Jesus...whose father and mother we know?** - This remark appears in the form of a question to emphasize that the Jewish leaders believe that Jesus is no one special. AT: "This is just Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know! (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How then does he say, 'I have come down out of heaven?'** - This remark appears in the form of a question to emphasize that the Jewish leaders do not believe that Jesus came from heaven. AT: "He is lying when he says that he came from heaven!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
