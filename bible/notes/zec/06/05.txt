===== translationNotes: =====

  * **These are the four winds of heaven** - The chariots symbolize the four winds of heaven, but they are not literally the four winds. AT: "These chariots represent the four winds of heaven" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **the four winds of heaven** - This phrase refers to the four directions from which the wind blows: north, east, south, and west. However, some modern versions interpret this Hebrew expression to mean "four spirits."
  * **standing before the Lord of all the earth** - The idiom to "stand before" means to be in a person's presence and to serve him. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:zec:04:14|4:14]]. AT: "serving the Lord of all the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the white horses are going out to the west country** - Some modern versions interpret this Hebrew phrase to mean "the white horses are going out after them," that is, following the black horses to the north country.
  * **the white horses are ... the spotted gray horses are** - Here the horses represent the chariots that they pull. AT: "the chariot with the white horses is ... the chariot with the spotted gray horses is" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
