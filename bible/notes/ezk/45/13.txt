\v 13 This is the oblation that you shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and you shall give the sixth
part of an ephah from a homer of barley;
\v 14 and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor,
which is ten baths, even a homer (for ten baths are a homer);
\v 15 and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel;â€”for a grain offering, and for a
burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, says the Lord Jehovah.
