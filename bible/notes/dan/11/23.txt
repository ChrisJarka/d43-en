\v 23 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; for he shall come up, and shall become strong, with a small
people.
\v 24 In time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers
have not done, nor his fathersâ€™ fathers; he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance: yea, he shall devise his
devices against the strongholds, even for a time.
