\v 5 Dear friend, you are serving Jesus loyally whenever you do things to help fellow believers, even strangers whom you do not know, who are traveling around doing God's work.
\v 6 Some of them have reported before the congregation here how you have showed that you love them. You should continue to help such people do their work in a way that honors God.


\p
\v 7 When those fellow believers went out to tell people about Jesus, they received no money from people who do not believe in Christ.
\v 8 So we who believe in Christ ought to give food and money to such people as these, to work with them to help others know God's true message.

\v 5 Beloved, you practice faithfulness whenever you work for the brothers and for strangers,
\v 6 who have borne witness of your love before the church. You will do well to send them forward on their journey worthy of God,
\v 7 because for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing from the Gentiles.
\v 8 We therefore ought to welcome such as these, so that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.
