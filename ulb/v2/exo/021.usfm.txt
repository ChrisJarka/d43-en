\c 21
\p
\v 1 Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them.
\p
\v 2 If you buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
\v 3 If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him.
\v 4 If his master give him a wife and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he
shall go out by himself.
\v 5 But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
\v 6 then his master shall bring him to God, and shall bring him to the door, or to the door-post; and his master shall
bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
\p
\v 7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the male servants do.
\v 8 If she please not her master, who has espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a
foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.
\v 9 And if he espouse her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
\v 10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
\v 11 And if he do not these three things to her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.
\p
\v 12 He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death.
\v 13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint you a place whither he
shall flee.
\v 14 And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to kill him with guile; you shall take him from mine altar, that he
may die.
\p
\v 15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
\p
\v 16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 17 And he that curses his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 18 And if men contend, and one strike the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed;
\v 19 if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that struck him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of
his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
\p
\v 20 And if a man strike his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished.
\v 21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.
\p
\v 22 And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be
surely fined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
\v 23 But if any harm follow, then you shall give life for life,
\v 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
\v 25 burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
\p
\v 26 And if a man strike the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye’s
sake.
\v 27 And if he strike out his man-servant’s tooth, or his maid-servant’s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.
\p
\v 28 And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the
owner of the ox shall be quit.
\v 29 But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it has been testified to its owner, and he has not kept it in, but it
has killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.
\v 30 If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is laid upon him.
\v 31 Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done to him.
\v 32 If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the
ox shall be stoned.
\p
\v 33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein,
\v 34 the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money to the owner thereof, and the dead
beast shall be his.
\p
\v 35 And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it: and
the dead also they shall divide.
\v 36 Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner has not kept it in, he shall surely pay ox
for ox, and the dead beast shall be his own.
