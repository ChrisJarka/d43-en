\v 13 Therefore we have been encouraged. In our encouragement we rejoiced even more because of the joy of Titus, because mind has been eased by all of you.
\v 14 For if I have boasted about him to you, I was not ashamed of it; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, our boasting about Titus also proved truthful.
