\v 22 "Your eyes are \add like\add* a lamp \f + \ft metaphor \f* for your body, because they enable you to see things. So if your eyes are healthy, you are able to see everything well \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if you are generous with your money and other possessions, you will be able to know much of what God wants you to know\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 23 But if your eyes are bad, you are not able to see things well. And if that continues, the time will come when you will not be able to see at all. You will be in complete darkness \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if you continue to be greedy, you will be in spiritual darkness. If all that your eyes can see and your mind can think about involves your greedily desiring material possessions, all that you do will be evil\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*."

\v 24 "No one is able to serve two \add different\add* bosses \add at the same time\add*. If \add he tried to do that\add*, he would hate one of them and love the other one, or he would be loyal to one of them and despise the other one \f + \ft doublet \f*. \add Similarly\add*, you cannot \add devote your life to\add* worshipping God and \add worshipping\add* money and material goods \add at the same time\add*."

\v 22 The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore your eye be single, your whole body shall be full of light.
\v 23 But if your eye be evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you be darkness,
how great is the darkness!
\v 24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and
despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
