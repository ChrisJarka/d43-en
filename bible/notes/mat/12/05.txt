====== Matthew 12:5-6 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 5 Also, think about the laws that \add Moses wrote\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. He said that \add even though\add* the priests, \add by working\add* in the Temple on our Jewish day of rest, are not obeying the Jewish day of rest \add laws\add*, they are not guilty. You have surely read that, \add but you do not understand what it means\add*. \v 6 Note this: \add God allows men to work in\add* the Temple \add on our rest day because that work must be done. But in addition, I\add* tell you that\add I have\add* more \add authority than the authority of\add* the Temple. So, it is more important for you to obey my teachings than to obey your traditions about our rest day. </usfm>

<usfm> \v 5 Also, surely you have read what Moses wrote, when he said that even though the priests, by working in the temple on our Sabbath day, are not obeying the Jewish day of rest laws, they are not guilty. \v 6 Let me tell you what this means: I have come to you, and I am more important than the temple, so what I teach is more important for you to obey than what our ancestors said about the Sabbath day. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====
