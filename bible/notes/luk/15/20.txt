===== Translation Notes: =====


    * Jesus continues his story
    * **And he left**  - that is, he departed from the country far away from his father's house.
    * **and he left and came towards his father**  - or, "he left and started home", or "he left and started going back to his father"
    * **Still far away**- that is, at far distance.
    * **moved with compassion**  - literally means feeling pity, sympathy, or love. It comes from the word for the bowels or inner parts of the body. In the Greek world, the bowels were the seat of the emotion and the source of love. The father's response is an emotional one that comes from the depths of who he is. He sees his son and loves him. He was moved from the heart.
    * **Your sight**- that is, in your presence.
    * **ran and hugged and kissed**  -The word for kiss here is an affectionate kiss with strong emotion. It shows the father poured out his love for his son as he kissed him and hugged his neck.
    * **bold words**  - explanation
