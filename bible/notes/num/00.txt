**What is Numbers about?**\\

While Numbers contains a many lists of numbers, this is only part of the book. It has the longest narrative about the people of Israel of any book of the Pentateuch, except Genesis. It is the story of the defeats and disappointment of the people of Israel int he wilderness. After many defeats, Israel was very discouraged and they rebelled against the leaders God had given them. The was a great tragedy in Kadesh Barnea because the people of Israel failed to enter the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]]. The report frightened some of the spies that they refused to go into the Promised Land. Because of this, Yahweh delayed Israel’s entry for forty years (13:1–14:45). Only Joshua and Caleb were permitted to enter the Promised Land. This book also records the faults, frailty, and courage of their leader Moses. 

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
These titles often describe the author or audience of the biblical book. Many titles summarize the contents of the book. It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or to follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]). The title of this book, “Numbers” refers to the [[:en:obe:other:census]] that was to be taken of the children of Israel. 

**Who wrote Numbers?**\\

The Bible tells us that Moses composed the book of Numbers. The writers of both the Old and New Testament confirm his part in the composition of the book of Numbers. However, later scribes and priests put the book in its present form, including material from other sources such as eyewitness accounts, and books of history (21:14), “The Book of the Wars of the Lord,” is a book that may have been completed after Moses’ death, and was known by later scribes, who worked on the book of Numbers. Ultimately, one can say that God is the author of Genesis because he inspired Moses’s writings.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**Does God punish Israel as a whole?**\\
Because Israel has a special relationship with Yahweh, who was their God and king, they experienced divine punishment for their sin. Their disobedience was corporate or as a whole. 

**What is the relationship between the Jewish religion and the religion of the nations?**\\
In Exodus, we are told that Israel was to be a "holy nation."  They were to be different than the other nations around them and not worship the [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|false gods]] of these nations.  Their idolatry and worship of the god Baal begins in Numbers. While Israel is [[:en:obe:kt:  unfaithful|unfaithful]] and lost out on divine blessings, Yahweh remained [[:en:obe:kt:faithful|faithful]] to them. Additionally, [[:en:obe:kt:avenge|vengenence]] was prevalent in many Ancient Near East cultures, but the Law of Moses protects people and prohibits the enacting of vengeance. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**Why does Moses speak using third person pronouns?**\\
When an author wrote about something he was involved in, it was common for him to use the pronoun "he" instead of "I" or "they" instead of "we." 

**What type of writing is Numbers?**\\
There are many different categories of writing which occur in different parts of the book.  These often lack easily defined transitions.  This will pose a challenge for translators, smooth transitions may not be possible.
