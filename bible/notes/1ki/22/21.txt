\v 21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.
\v 22 And Jehovah said to him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
prophets. And he said, You shall entice him, and shall prevail also: go forth, and do so.
\v 23 Now therefore, behold, Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and Jehovah has spoken
evil concerning thee.
