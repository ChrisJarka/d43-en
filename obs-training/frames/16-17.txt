**This pattern repeated many times**: the **[[:en:obe:other:israel|Israelites]]** would **[[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]]**, **[[:en:obe:kt:god|God]]** would **[[:en:obe:other:punish|punish]]** them, they would **[[:en:obe:kt:repent|repent]]**, and God would send a **[[:en:obe:kt:deliverer|deliverer]]** to **[[:en:obe:kt:save|save]]** them. Over many years, God sent many deliverers who saved the Israelites from their enemies.
