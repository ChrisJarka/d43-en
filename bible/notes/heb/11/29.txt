But, when the \add army of\add* Egypt also attempted to \add cross that same water\add*, they drowned, because \add the sea came back and flooded them!\add*
\p
\v 30 It was because the \add Israelite\add* people trusted God that the walls around Jericho \add city\add* collapsed, after the Israelites marched around the walls for seven days.
\p
\v 31 Rahab \add had been\add* a prostitute, but because she trusted God, she did not perish with those \add inside Jericho\add* who disobeyed \add God.
