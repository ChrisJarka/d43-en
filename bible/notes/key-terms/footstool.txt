====== footstool ======

===== Definition: =====

A footstool is an object upon which a person may raise and rest his feet while sitting.

  * In scripture, it is a place where God's authority is permanently represented, as in 1 Chronicles 28:2, where King David wishes to build the temple as a "place of rest for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, for the footstool of our God."
  * A footstool also represents having power over your enemies, as when God the Father tells Jesus to sit at His right hand until He makes Jesus' enemies a footstool for his feet.
