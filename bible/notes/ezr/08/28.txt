\v 28 I said to those priests, "You belong to Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped\f + \ft Or: also belonged to \f*, and these valuable things also belong to him. The people themselves gave these things to be offerings to Yahweh voluntarily\f + \ft Or: because they wanted to \f*.
\v 29 So guard them carefully, and \add when we arrive\add* in Jerusalem, weigh them in the presence of the priests, the descendants of Levi \add who will help the priests\add*, and the other Israelite leaders there. They will then put them in the storerooms in the new temple."
\v 30 So the priests and descendants of Levi took from me all the gifts of silver and gold and the other valuable items, in order to carry them to the temple in Jerusalem.

\v 28 And I said to them, You are holy to Jehovah, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a
free will offering to Jehovah, the God of your fathers.
\v 29 Watch you, and keep them, until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the
fathersâ€™ houses of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.
\v 30 So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to
Jerusalem to the house of our God.
