\v 17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, you will not redeem. They are holy. You will sprinkle their blood upon the altar and will burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet aroma to Yahweh.
\v 18 The flesh of them will be yours, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it will be yours.
