<usfm>
\q
\v 16 My beloved is mine, and I am his;
\q he grazes among the lilies with pleasure.

\q

\q before the soft winds of dawn blow and the shadows flee away.
\q Go away; be like a gazelle or a young stag
\q on the rugged mountains.

  * [[:en:obe:kt:beloved]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **My beloved is mine** - "My beloved belongs to me"
  * **beloved** - Some versions such as the UDB understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13]].
  * **and I am his** - "and I belong to him"
  * **he grazes** - "feeds" or "eats grass." The woman speaks of the man as if he were "a gazelle or a young stag" (verse 17) that eats plants among the lilies. Grazing is probably a metaphor for lovemaking ([[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:01|2:1-2]]). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **lilies** - sweet-smelling flowers that grow in places where there is much water. Translate as the plural of "lily" in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:01|2:1]].
  * **dawn** - the part of the day when the sun is rising
  * **the shadows flee away** - The woman describes the shadows as though they were running away from the light of the sun. AT: "the shadows disappear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **like a gazelle or a young stag** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:08|2:9]].
  * **gazelle** - an animal that looks like a deer and moves quickly. Translate as the singular of "gazelles" as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:07|2:7]].
  * **stag** - an adult male deer
  * **rugged** - "rocky" or "rough"
