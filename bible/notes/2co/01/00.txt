====== 2 Corinthians 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The first paragraph is a reflection of a common way to begin a letter in the ancient Near East. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:19, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

== Paul's Defense ==
This begins a major part of the Epistle 1-6. People have been criticizing Paul saying he is not sincere. He refutes them by explaining his motives for what he is doing.  

=== Special Concepts ===

== Unity == 
For Paul, unity in the local church was essential. This chapter focus on the issue of unity and Paul rebukes the Corinthians for claiming to follow different [[:en:obe:kt:apostle|apostles]] and the importance placed on the person who performed a Christian's baptism.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical question ==

Paul uses two [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|rhetorical questions]] for the purpose of defending himself against a charge of insincerity. They serve to convict the reader that their beliefs about Paul are incorrect.

== Contrast ==

There are many figures that are used to contrast each other in this chapter. The [[:en:obe:kt:wise|wise]] and the [[:en:obe:kt:foolish|foolish]], the lowly boasting and the rich and those who lack are some example.
