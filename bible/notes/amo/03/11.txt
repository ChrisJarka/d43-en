\q
\v 11 Therefore, this is what the Lord Yahweh says,
\q "An enemy will surround the land.
\q He will pull down your strongholds,
\q And plunder your fortresses."
\q
\v 12 This is waht Yahweh says,
\q As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion
\q Two legs,
\q Or a piece of an ear,
\q So will the children of Israel be rescued who live in Samaria,
\q With the corner of a couch,
\q Or fabric of a bed."
