\v 3 None of you should be concerned about someone else's small faults! That would be like noticing a speck in that person's eye. But you should be concerned about your own big faults. They are like logs in your own eye that you do not notice.
\v 4 You should not say to other people about their minor faults, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye!' You should not say that if a log is still in your own eye.
\v 5 You hypocrite, stop sinning in all the large ways you do. Then you will be able to help other people stop sinning in their small ways."

\v 3 And why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother’s eye, but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
\v 4 How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye', while the log is in your own eye?
\v 5 You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the piece of straw that is in your brother's eye.
