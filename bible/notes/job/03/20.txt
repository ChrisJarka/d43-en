===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Why is light given to him who is in misery; why is life given to the one who is bitter in soul**  - Job uses parallelism to emphasis what he is saying (See:Parallelism)
    * **Why is light given to him who is in misery**  - "Why does God give life to a suffering person?" Job does not expect an answer to this question, he is wondering why people must stay alive and suffer. This can be written as a sentence : "I do not understand why God gives life to people who are suffering." (See:Rhetorical question)
    * **why is life given to the one who is bitter in soul**  - "why does God give life to a miserable person?" See previous note. This can be written as a sentence : "I do not understand why God gives life to people who are very unhappy" 
    * **to one who longs for death, but it does not come**  - "to a person who no longer wants to be alive, but is still alive"
    * **Why is light given to one who rejoices very much and is glad when he can find the grave** - "why does God give life to somebody who is very happy to no longer be alive?" See previous note. This can be written as a sentence : "I do not understand why God allows a person to keep living when the person would rather be buried in the ground"
    * **Why is light given**  - This phrase is not found in the Hebrew, but is supplied in order to start a new question.  
    * **to one who rejoices very much and is glad**  - "to a person who is very happy." These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are repeated for emphasis (See:Doublet)
    * **when he can find the grave** - The person no longer being alive is implicit. Alternate translation : "when he is no longer alive and can be buried." (See:Implicit/Explicit)
