===== Definition: =====

  * The 365-day year is part of the solar calendar, which is based on the amount of time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun.
  * The system of counting time that was used in the Bible was usually the lunar calendar which resulted in a year being about 354 days long.
  * The difference in number of days was adjusted by adding an extra month to certain years.
