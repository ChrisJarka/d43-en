\v 19 My fellow believers, if anyone of you stops obeying the true message \add from God\add*, someone from among you should persuade that person to once again do \add what God has told us to do\add*. \add If he stops doing what is wrong\add*,
\v 20 the one \add who persuaded him\add* should realize that \add because\add* he has enabled the person who was sinning to stop doing what is wrong, \add God\add* will save that person from \add spiritual\add* death\f + \ft Or: being separated from him forever \f*, and will forgive \add his\add* many sins.

\v 19 My brothers and sisters, if anyone of you stops obeying the true message from God, someone from among you should persuade that person to once again do what God has told us to do. If he stops doing what is wrong,
\v 20 the one who persuaded him should realize that because he has enabled the person who was sinning to stop doing what is wrong, God will save that person from spiritual death, and will forgive his many sins.

\v 19 My brothers, suppose that one among you wanders away from the truth, but that someone else leads him back.
\v 20 Let him know that whoever turns a sinner out of the wandering from his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **brothers** - "fellow believers"
  * **suppose that one among you wanders away from the truth, but that someone else leads him back** - A believer who stops trusting in God and obeying him is spoken of as if he were a sheep that wandered away from the flock. The person who persuades him to trust in God again is spoken of as if he were a shepherd who went to search for the lost sheep. AT: "if anyone stops obeying God, but another person helps him start obeying again." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **let him know** - "let the one who leads him back know"
  * **will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins** - Here James uses the word "soul" to show this "death" is more than just physical death. The word "soul" refers to the person who is sinning. Here "death" refers to spiritual death, eternal separation from God. AT: "will save the sinner from spiritual death, and God will forgive the sinner for all of his sins." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **will cover a multitude of sins** -
