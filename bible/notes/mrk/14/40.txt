\v 40 When he returned, he found that they were sleeping again because they were so sleepy that they could not keep their eyes open. Because they were ashamed, they did not know what to say to him when he awakened them.
\v 41 Then he went and prayed again. He returned a third time; and he found them sleeping again. He woke all of them and said to them, "I am disappointed that you are sleeping again! You have slept enough. The time for me to suffer is about to begin. Look! Someone is about to enable sinful men to seize me, the one who came from heaven.
\v 42 So get up! Let's go toward him! Look! Here comes the one who is enabling them to seize me!"

\v 40 And again he came, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they knew not what to answer him.
\v 41 And he comes the third time, and says to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough; the hour is come;
behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\v 42 Arise, let us be going: behold, he that betrays me is at hand.
