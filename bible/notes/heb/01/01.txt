\v 1 Long ago God communicated frequently to our ancestors in various ways by what the prophets said and wrote.
\v 2 But now when this final age is beginning, God has communicated to us by his own Son. God has chosen him to possess all things. By him God also created the universe.
\v 3 God's Son is the light of God's powerful brilliance. He shows exactly what God is truly like. All things that existâ€”he keeps them existing by giving powerful commands. After he had acted so that all sin should be forgiven, he rose into heaven and sat down at the highest place of honor, at the right side of God the Father, where he rules with him.

\v 1  Long ago God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in many ways.
\v 2 But in these recent days, God has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed to be the heir of all things. It is through him that he also made the universe.
\v 3 His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very character of his essence. He sustains all things by the word of his power. After he had achieved cleansing for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The prologue lays the background for the whole book, the unsurpassing greatness of the Son - the Son is greater than all. It begins with emphasizing that the Son is better than the prophets and the angels.
  * **General Information:** - Though not told at the opening of this letter, it was written particularly to Hebrews (Jews) who would have understood the significance of the many references in it to the Old Testament.

  * **radiance** - "light"
  * **the very character of his essence** - Identical to God.
  * **the word of his power** - "his powerful word"
  * **he had achieved cleansing for sins** - The author speaks of forgiveness of sins as if it were a cleansing or washing. This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "cleansing" is expressed as the verb "making clean." AT: "he had finished making us clean from sin." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]))
  * **God has spoken to us by a Son...through whom he...made the universe** - The Son of God is God, God the Son. The Son created the universe.
  * **Son** - This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very character of his essence...he sustains all things** - The Son radiates God's glory, has the character and essence of God, and holds together the universe he created, because he is God.
  * **the right hand** - This idea represents here the place of highest honor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
