===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 By committing many sins
\q2 and by buying and selling things dishonestly,
\q2 you caused your places of worship to become unacceptable to me.
\q1 So I caused a fire to burn down your city.
\q2 Your city was burned completely;
\q1 the people who were watching it saw
\q2 that only ashes remained on the ground.
\q1
\v 19 All the people who knew what your city was like previously
\q2 were appalled.
\q1 Now your city has disappeared,
\q2 and it will not exist anymore.'~"

<usfm>
\v 18 By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness of your traffic, you have profaned your sanctuaries;
therefore have I brought forth a fire from the midst of you; it has devoured you, and I have turned you to ashes upon the
earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
\v 19 All they that know you among the peoples shall be astonished at you: you are become a terror, and you shall nevermore
have any being.
