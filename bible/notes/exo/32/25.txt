\v 25 Moses saw that the people were running wild, for Aaron had let them get out of control to the secret delight of their enemies.
\v 26 Then Moses stood at the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is on Yahweh's side, come to me." All the Levites gathered themselves around him.
\v 27 He said to them, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Let each  man fasten his sword on his side and go to and go from gate to gate throughout the camp, and kill every man his brother, his companion, and his
neighbor."
