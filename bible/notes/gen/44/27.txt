<usfm>
\v 27 Our father replied, 'You know that my wife Rachel gave birth to two sons for me.
\v 28 One of them disappeared, and I said, "A wild animal has surely torn him to pieces." And I have not seen him since then.
\v 29 If you take this other one from me, too, and something harms him, you would cause me, an old gray-haired man, to die because of my sorrow.'

\v 28 And the one went out from me and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces, and I have not seen him since."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Judah continues his story to Joseph

  * **said to us** - Here "us" does not include Joseph. (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons. And the one went out from me and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces, and I have not seen him since." And if you take this one also from me and harm comes to him, you will bring down my gray hair with sorrow to sheol'** - This has a two level and three level quotation. They can be stated as indirect quotations. AT: "to us that we know that his wife, Rachel, bore him only two sons, and that one of them went out and an animal tore him to pieces, and he has not seen him since. Then he said that if we take his other son and something bad happens to him, then we would cause him to die of sorrow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  * **You know** - Here "You" is plural and refers to the brothers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **And if you take this one also from me** - "you" refers to Judah, "this one" refers to Benjamin, and "me" refers to Jacob.
  * **you will bring down my gray hair with sorrow to sheol** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:42:37|42:38]].
