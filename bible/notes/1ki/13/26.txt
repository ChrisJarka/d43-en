\v 26 When the old man who had brought the prophet from Judah to his home heard about it, he said, "That is the prophet who disobeyed what Yahweh told him to do! That is why Yahweh allowed the lion to attack him and kill him. That is what Yahweh said would happen!"
\p
\v 27 Then he said to his sons, "Put a saddle on my donkey." So they did that.
\v 28 Then he rode on the donkey and found the prophet's corpse on the road, and his donkey and the lion were still standing there alongside the corpse. But the lion had not eaten any of the flesh of the prophet and had not attacked the donkey.

\p
\v 26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient
to the mouth of Jehovah: therefore Jehovah has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him, and slain him, according to
the word of Jehovah, which he spoke to him.
\v 27 And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled it.
\v 28 And he went and found his body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the
body, nor torn the ass.
