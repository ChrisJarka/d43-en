====== Ezekiel 16:32-34 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 You are like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a woman who commits adultery: You prefer to \add have sex with\add* strangers rather than with your husband.
\v 33 Prostitutes are paid, but \add it is as though\add* you give gifts to all your lovers; you bribe them to come to you from everywhere to have sex with you.
\v 34 So although you act like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a prostitute, you are not like other prostitutes: no one needs to request you to have sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with them. You are the opposite of other prostitutes; instead of them giving any money to you, you give men money to have sex with you.

\v 33 Prostitutes are paid, but it is as though you give gifts to all your lovers; you bribe them to come to you from everywhere to have sex with you.
\v 34 So although you act like you are a prostitute, you are actually the opposite of other prostitutes! Instead of them giving any money to you, you give men money to have sex with you!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 32 Adulterous woman, you take strangers instead of you husband!
\v 33 People give payment to every prostitute, you give your wages to all your lovers and bribe them to come to you from all around for your whoredoms.
\v 34 So there is a difference between you and those other women with your whoredom, since no one goes to you for sex, but instead you pay the wage!  
But no wage is given for you, so you are different.
