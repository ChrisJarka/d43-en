\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
\v 2 The same was in the beginning with God.
\v 3 All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that has been made.
\v 4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
\v 5 And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.
\v 6 There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.
\v 7 The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.
\v 8 He was not the light, but came that he might bear witness of the light.
\v 9 There was the true light, even the light which lighteth every man, coming into the world.
\v 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not.
\v 11 He came to his own, and they that were his own received him not.
\v 12 But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God,
even to them that believe on his name:
\v 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
\v 14 And the Word became flesh, and lived among us (and we [*]saw his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father),
full of grace and truth.
\v 15 John bears witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is become before me:
for he was before me.
\v 16 For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace.
\v 17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
\v 18 No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared
him.
\p
\v 19 And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent to him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who are thou?
\v 20 And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.
\v 21 And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Are you the prophet? And he answered, No.
\v 22 They said therefore to him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What say you of thyself?
\v 23 He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.
\v 24 And they had been sent from the Pharisees.
\v 25 And they asked him, and said to him, Why then baptizest you, if you are not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the
prophet?
\v 26 John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: in the midst of you stands one whom you know not,
\v 27 even he that comes after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.
\v 28 These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
\p
\v 29 On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world!
\v 30 This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who is become before me: for he was before me.
\v 31 And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water.
\v 32 And John bare witness, saying, I have [*]saw the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.
\v 33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, Upon whoever you shall see the Spirit
descending, and living upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit.
\v 34 And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.
\p
\v 35 Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;
\v 36 and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!
\v 37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
\v 38 And Jesus turned, and [*]saw them following, and says to them, What seek ye? And they said to him, Rabbi (which is
to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abidest thou?
\v 39 He says to them, Come, and you shall see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day:
it was about the tenth hour.
\v 40 One of the two that heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peterâ€™s brother.
\v 41 He finds first his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted,
Christ).
\v 42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, You are Simon the son of John: you shall be called Cephas
(which is by interpretation, Peter).
\p
\v 43 On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he finds Philip: and Jesus says to him, Follow me.
\v 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
\v 45 Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus
of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
\v 46 And Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
\v 48 Nathanael says to him, Whence know you me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when you
was under the fig tree, I saw thee.
\v 49 Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are King of Israel.
\v 50 Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you underneath the fig tree, believest you? you
shall see greater things than these.
\v 51 And he says to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, You shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending
and descending upon the Son of man.
