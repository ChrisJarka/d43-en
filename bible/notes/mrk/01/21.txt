\v 21 Jesus and the disciples went into a nearby town called Capernaum. On the next Sabbath, he went into the synagogue and began teaching the people who had gathered there.
\v 22 They were amazed at the way he taught. He taught like a teacher who relies on what he himself knows. He did not teach like those who taught the Jewish laws, who repeated the different things that other men had taught.

\v 21 Then they went into Capernaum; immediately Jesus went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he was teaching them. 
\v 22 Jesus astonished them with his teaching, for he taught them as one with authority and not as the scribes.
