<usfm>
\v 6 If fellow believers teach you the truth about God, then you should share your possessions with them.
\v 7 You should not deceive yourselves. Remember that no one can deceive God. Just like a farmer will harvest exactly the kind of crop that he plants, God will pay back people according to what they have done.
\v 8 God will punish eternally those who commit the sins that they wish to. But those who please God's Spirit will live forever with God because of what God's Spirit does for them.

\v 6 The one who is taught the word must share all good things with the teacher.
\v 7 Do not deceived, God is not mocked. Whatever a man plants he will also harvest.
