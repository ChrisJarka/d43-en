\v 18 Disregard those who say that God will punish you because \add you do not worship God in the way that\add* they say \add that you should\add*; that is, they insist that you should humiliate yourselves and that you should worship the angels. \add Disregard such people\add* since they base their authority on things that they have never seen, and since they are proud without reason because their self-directed nature \add controls\add* what they think,
\v 19 and since they do not teach the true teaching about Christ \f + \ft metaphor \f*\add . Christ is the one who causes all of his people to develop\f + \ft Or: grow \f* spiritually as God plans that they should develop\f + \ft Or: grow \f*, just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a person's head directs how his body grows, as it is held together by its joints and ligaments.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Do not let people prevent God from saving you by convincing you to believe what they say and that you must behave very humbly and worship angels. These people are always talking about visions they say God has made them see. They boast about these things because they think like people everywhere think who do not honor God.
\v 19 Such persons are not joined to Christ. But he is like the head of a body, and that body is all those who believe in him. The whole body depends upon the head. The bones and ligaments hold the body together, but it is God that makes it grow, and it is the head that gives it what it needs.

===== ULB: =====
<usfm>
\v 18 Let no one be robbed of a prize by desiring humility and by worship of angels. Such a person enters into the things he has seen and becomes puffed up by his fleshly thinking.
\v 19 He does not hold on to the head. It is from the head that the whole body throughout its joints and ligaments is supplied and held together; it grows with the growth given by God.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Let no one be robbed of a prize** - This metaphor compares people who teach false humility and the worship of angels to robbers who steal the Colossians' salvation. AT: "Let no one cheat you of a prize" or "Do not let anyone steal someone's reward." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and  [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **humility** - This refers to doing things that make someone seem humble, but are done for reasons of pride. AT: "pious self-denial"
  * **enters into the things he has seen** - Here Paul  speaks about people who claim to have dreams and visions from God, and who talk proudly about them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **puffed up** - Here an arrogant, conceited person is spoken of as if he were an object into which someone had blown air to make it larger than it should be. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his fleshly thinking** - 
  * 
  * Thinking as a sinful person rather than as a person led by the Holy Spirit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He does not hold on to** - "He does not firmly grasp" or "He does not cling to," just as a child firmly holds on to his parent. Paul speaks of trusting Christ as though one were grasping Christ with one's hands.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It is from the head that the whole body throughout its joints and ligaments** - With this metaphor, Paul speaks of the Church, which is ruled and empowered by Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
