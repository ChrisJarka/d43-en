====== How to Create Translation Notes ======

==== These are some ideas to guide how the Translation Notes are created:====

  * Select a portion from the ULB that needs a note and write it in bold by one of the bullets under "Translation Notes."
  * Write a translation suggestion that can be used in place of the portion you have selected.
    * If the suggestion is synonymous with the ULB, start it with "That is" followed by a comma.
    * If the suggestion includes making implied information explicit, or if it suggests a less specific way of translating the text, start it with "This can also be translated as" followed by a comma.
    * Put the suggestion in quotes and if there is more than one suggestion, separate them with the word "or."
        * That is, "Y."
        * This can also be translated as, "X" or "Y" or "Z".
  *  You may also need to explain the issue, but try to include a translation suggestion.
  *  If there is a Translation Academy page that deals with the issue, refer to it by writing, for example, "(See: Metonymy)" or "(See: Exclusive)" at the end of the note.  You can see these at [[en:ta:ta-topics|Topics]].
  * Normally we do not need to write notes for key terms. However, when a key term has multiple senses, you may need to write a note telling which sense is meant in the text.
  * If you write several translation suggestions and one of them is the UDB, write  "(UDB)" after it. 
==== Here are some reasons for different kinds of translation notes:====

  * An English word or phrase may have __multiple meanings__, so we want to help them understand which meaning is intended.
  * It may not be obvious __what a particular pronoun refers to__. Or it may be obvious to us, but if the antecedent is on a previous chunk, it might help to remind the translators.
  * We may need to __explain a particular figure of speech__. We may need to give some translation suggestions for groups that would not understand the figure of speech as is, or that would not use that kind of figure of speech in that context. For example, some languages use rhetorical questions only for rebuking, not for presenting a new topic that one plans to teach about.
  * We may need to give information that will help translators choose the appropriate __grammatical form__ in their language. For example, many languages have distinct singular and plural forms of "you," but English does not. If it is not clear from the English text which is intended, we may need to state it in a note and direct the translators to the Translation Academy page that deals with that issue. For example, "At this point, Jesus was only addressing Peter, so languages that have singular and plural forms of 'you' would use the singular form here. (See: Singular Pronoun)"
  * We may need to give translation suggestions for languages that don't use certain __syntactic structures__ or that would not use them in certain contexts. For example, some languages don't have passive clauses, or only use them in certain situations. Some languages don't use relative clauses for all the same purposes that English uses them. Some languages use direct quotes in certain situations and indirect quotes in others.
  *  We may need to make some __implicit information explicit__ for people who are not familiar with the cultures of the Bible.
  * If a page has a __continuing quote__, we'll need a note in parentheses like "John continues speaking to the crowd" or "Jesus continues speaking to his disciples."
==== List of Important Terms ====

The Important Terms section will have a list of the important terms in in the ULB. Each word will be linked to a Key Term page that explains it. Do not write anything in this section.  If you think a word should be included, say so in the Discussion section.
