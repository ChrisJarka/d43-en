===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking.

    * **the earth will be shaken out of its place, by the fury of Yahweh of Hosts, and on the day of his fierce anger** - Yahweh is speaking, but he refers to himself by his own name. Alternate translation: "the fury of Yahweh of Hosts will shake the earth out of its place on the day of my great anger." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_123person]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) 
    * **Yahweh of Hosts** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
    * **Like a hunted gazelle or like a sheep with no shepherd** - Gazelles are thin, small animals that can run quickly. Gazelles and sheep are prey to other wild animals. This emphasizes that the people of the world will run away like scared animals. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] and [[:en:ta:translate:simile]])
