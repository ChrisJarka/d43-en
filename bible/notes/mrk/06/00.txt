====== Mark 06 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Anointed with oil" ==
This was probably a practice used in the ancient Near East for people who were sick.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
Mark uses many [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|rhetorical questions]] in this chapter to show that people did not understand who Jesus was.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Past Events ==
Parts of this chapter are a narrative sequence of events that have already happen. Marks sometimes writes as if the events have already happened and at other times writes as if the events are still in progress. He also writes in the past and present tenses within the same sentence. This can cause difficulty in translation by creating an illogical order of events. It may be necessary to make these consistent by writing as if all the events have already happened.
