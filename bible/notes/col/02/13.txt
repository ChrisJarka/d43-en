\v 13 And specifically, you \add who are non-Jews\add*, because of your sins, you were \add spiritually\add* dead \add before you trusted in Christ\add*. You were uncircumcised \add spiritually;\add* that is, your self-directed nature controlled you. Nevertheless, it was you whom God caused to become alive \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* with Christ. And specifically, God forgave us all our sins.
\v 14 \add It is just\add* as \add though\add* he canceled the document\f + \ft Or: paper \f* \add that stated\add* \add the charges\add* against us\f + \ft Or: the sins \add that we had committed\add* \f* for which \add God\add* will punish us. And \add it was just\add* as \add though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* it was that document, Or: paper that he removed by nailing it to the cross \add when they nailed Christ on the cross\add*.
\v 15 And specifically, God defeated the \add evil\add* spirit beings that rule, and he demonstrated\f + \ft Or: showed \f* that publicly; that is, he triumphed over them as a result of what \add Christ did\add*.

\v 13 God viewed you as being dead, because you were sinning against him, and because you were not Jews, so you did not worship him. But he made you come alive together with Christ; he forgave us of all our sins.
\v 14 We have all sinned so much, but God has forgiven our sins. It is like a man might forgive people who owe him money, so he tears up the papers they signed when he lent them the money. But as for God, it is as if he had nailed our papers to the cross that Christ died on--those papers on which he had written all our sins and also all the laws that we had broken.
\v 15 Moreover, God defeated the evil spirit beings who rule people in this world, and he let everybody know that he had defeated them. It was just as if he had paraded them around in the streets as prisoners!
