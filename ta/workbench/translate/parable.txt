A parable is a story that makes truth easy to understand and hard to forget.

==== Description ====
 
A parable is a story told to teach a truth. Though the events in the parable could happen, they did not actually happen. They are told only to teach a truth. Parables seldom contain the names of specific people (That may be a key for you in identifying what is a parable and what is a narrative account). \\  
(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])


>Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather, on the lampstand, and it shines for everyone in the house. Let your light shine before people in such a way that they see your good deeds and praise your Father who is in heaven. (Matthew 5:15-16 ULB)

==== Examples from the Bible ==== 

>Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather, on the lampstand, and it shines for everyone in the house. Let your light shine before people in such a way that they see your good deeds and praise your Father who is in heaven. (Matthew 5:15-16 ULB)

This parable teaches not to hide your living for God from other people.    

>Then he also told them a parable. “Can a blind person guide another blind person? If he did, they would both fall into a pit, would they not? (Luke 6:39 ULB)

This parable teaches that if a person does not have spiritual understanding, he cannot help someone else to understand spiritual things. 


===== Translation Strategies =====

  - If a parable is hard to understand because it has unknown ideas in it, replace the unknown thing with something known in your culture, but be careful to keep the teaching the same. (See: Unknown Ideas)
  - If the teaching of the parable is unclear, consider putting a hint in the quote introducer such as “Jesus told this story about being generous.”

1. If a parable is hard to understand because it has unknown ideas in it, replace the unknown thing with something known in your culture, but be careful to keep the teaching the same. 

  * **Jesus said to them, "Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed? You bring it in and you put it on a __lampstand__”**. (Mark 4:21 ULB) - If people do not know what a lampstand is, you could substitute something else that can be used for putting a light on where it will be seen clearly in the house.
    * Jesus said to them, "Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed? You bring it in and you put it on __a high shelf__. \\ 


  * **He said, "To what can we compare the kingdom of God and what parable can we use to explain it? It is like a mustard seed, which when it is __sown__ it is the smallest of all the seeds sown that lay upon the ground. Yet when it is __sown__, it grows up and becomes greater than all the garden plants. It puts out great branches, so even the birds of heaven can make their nests under its shade."** (Mark 4:30-32 ULB) - When people sow seeds, they toss them so that they scatter on the ground. If people are not familiar with sowing, you can substitute planting.
    *  He said, "To what can we compare the kingdom of God and what parable can we use to explain it? It is like a mustard seed, which when it is __planted__ in the ground it is the smallest of all the seeds planted in the ground. Yet when it is __planted__, it grows up and becomes greater than all the garden plants. It puts out great branches, so even the birds of heaven can make their nests under its shade." \\ 

2. If the teaching of the parable is unclear, consider putting a hint in the quote introducer such as “Jesus told this story about being generous.”

    * "__He told them a story about how the Kingdom of God grows__. "To what can we compare the kingdom of God and what parable can we use to explain it?
