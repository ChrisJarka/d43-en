====== Matthew 15:4-6 ======

<usfm>
\v 4 God gave these \add two\add* commands: 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'People who speak evil about their father or mother must be executed.'
\v 5 But you tell people, 'You can say to your father or mother, "What I was going to give to you \add to help provide for you\add*, \add I have now promised\add* to give\add to God\add*."'
\v 6 And if you do that, you think that you do not need to give anything to your parents. In \add that way\add*, \add by teaching people\add* your traditions, you disregard what God commanded.

\v 4 God gave these two commands--'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'People who speak evil about their father or mother must be executed.'
\v 5 But you tell the people, 'You can say to your father or mother, "What I was going to give to you to help provide for you, I have now promised to give to God."'
\v 6 When you do that, you think that you do not need to give anything to your parents. In that way you ignore what God commanded, just so that you can follow what your ancestors taught you!

<usfm>
\v 4 For God said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'He who speaks evil of his father or mother, will surely die.'
\v 5 But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "Whatever help you would have received from me is now a gift given to God,"'
\v 6 that person does not need to honor his father. Thus you have made void the word of God for the sake of your traditions.
