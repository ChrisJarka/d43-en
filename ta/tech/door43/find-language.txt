===== How to Find Your Language on Door43 =====

In the sidebar of each story, you should see a language selection field. Click in the field and start typing in the name of the target language. A list of available languages displays. If you see the language into which you would like to translate, click it.

The first OBS story should show in the window. If it does not, then the language needs to be added to Door43.

If you need a language added to Door43, please go to [[:obs-setup|Open Bible Stories Setup]]. Follow the directions on the page.

  * Pick a source language from a drop down menu.
  * Pick a Destination Language. Here is how:
      - In the field box, start typing the name of the target language.
      - Select language name from list.
  * Click the 'Create OBS Now' button.
  * A message that the stories have been created will appear in a few moments.
