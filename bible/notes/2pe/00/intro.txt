====== Introduction to 2 Peter ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of 2 Peter ===

  - Peter introduces himself and addresses his readers (1:12)
  - Then he reminds them to live good lives because God has enabled us to (1:321)
  - Next he warns against false teachers and says what will happen to false teachers in the end (2:122)
  - After that Peter finishes by encouraging believers to live good lives to prepare for the second coming of Jesus (3:117)

=== What is the Book of 2 Peter about? ===

Peter wrote this letter in order to encourage believers to live good lives and to warn them not to follow false teachers (2).  He encouraged them to ignore people who are saying that Jesus is taking too long to come back.  Instead he pointed out that God is not slow but wants everyone to be saved (2 Peter 3:8-9).  This is a reason to live a good life (3:14).

=== Who wrote the Book of 2 Peter? ===

The letter of 2 Peter states that it was written by the Apostle Peter, but many scholars today do not think that is true.  It is possible that someone else wrote it on Peter's behalf.  The author does say that he was an eyewitness to the life of Jesus and specifically to the transfiguration (1:17-18).  If Peter wrote the letter it is likely that he wrote it in Rome between 65-69 years after the birth of Christ, before he died.  Peter also calls it his second letter (3:1) placing the date of writing after the letter of 1 Peter.  He addressed the letter to all Christians.
