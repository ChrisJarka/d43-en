\v 11 For through your knowledge he that is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.
\v 12 And thus, by sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
\v 13 Therefore, if meat causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat flesh again so that I do not cause my brother to stumble.
