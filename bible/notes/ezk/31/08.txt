\v 8 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir-trees were not like its boughs, and the plane-trees were not as
its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like to it in its beauty.
\v 9 I made it fair by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.
