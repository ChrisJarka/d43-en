\v 46 And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus,
Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side.
\v 47 And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on
me.
\v 48 And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, You son of David, have
mercy on me.
