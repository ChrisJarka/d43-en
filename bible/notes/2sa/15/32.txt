\v 33 David said to him, "If you go with me, you will not be able to help me.
\v 34 But if you return to the city, \add you can help me by\add* saying to Absalom, 'Your Majesty, I will serve you as faithfully as I served your father.' If you do that \add and stay near Absalom\add*, you will be able to oppose any advice that Ahithophel gives to Absalom.

\v 32 And it came to pass, that, when David was come to the top of the
ascent, where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.
\v 33 And David said to him, If you passest on with me, then you will be a burden to me:
\v 34 but if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your fatherâ€™s servant
in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
