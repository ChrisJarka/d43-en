\v 1 But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow.
\v 2 For if I make you sorry, who then is he that makes me glad but he that is made sorry by me?
\v 3 And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having
confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
\v 4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that you should be made sorry, but
that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.
\p
\v 5 But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.
\v 6 Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted
by the many;
\v 7 so that contrariwise you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up
with his overmuch sorrow.
\v 8 Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love toward him.
\v 9 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.
\v 10 But to whom you forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything,
for your sakes have I forgiven it in the presence of Christ;
\v 11 that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
\p
\v 12 Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,
\v 13 I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into
Macedonia.
\p
\v 14 But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and makes manifest through us the savor of his
knowledge in every place.
\v 15 For we are a sweet savor of Christ to God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish;
\v 16 to the one a savor from death to death; to the other a savor from life to life. And who is sufficient for these
things?
\v 17 For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we
in Christ.
