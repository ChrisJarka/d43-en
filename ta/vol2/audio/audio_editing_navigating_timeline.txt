===== Timeline Navigation =====

//This page answers the question:// //How do I navigate the timeline?//

If there is one skill that greatly improves your effectiveness as an audio editor, it is the ability navigate quickly throughout the recorded audio file. Over time you will gain proficiency at quickly zooming in/out of the viewable area for effective assessment of the waveform and for good precision in selecting sections and making changes to that section (copying, pasting, deleting, changing amplitude, etc). Good audio editing software will allow you fast and effective navigation and zoom functionality by using the mouse scroll-wheel.
