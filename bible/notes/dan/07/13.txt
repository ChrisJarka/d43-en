\v 13 I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like to a son of man, and he came
even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
\v 14 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve
him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
