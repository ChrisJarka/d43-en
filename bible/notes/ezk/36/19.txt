\v 19 I scattered them among the nations and they were dispersed through the lands. I judged them according to their ways and their deeds.
\v 20 Then when they went to the nations—wherever they went, they profaned my holy name when people said of them, ‘These are the people of Yahweh? For they have been cast out from his land!’
\v 21 But I had compassion on account of my holy name that the house of Israel had defiled among the nations when they went there.
