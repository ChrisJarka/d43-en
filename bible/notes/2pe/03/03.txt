\v 3 Know this first, that mockers will come in the last days mocking you, going according to their own desires,
\v 4 and saying, "Where is the promise of his return? Our fathers have died, but all things remain the same since the beginning of creation."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Know this first** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2pe:01:19|1:20]]. 
  * **going according to their own desires** - Here the word "desires" refers to sinful desires that are opposed to God's will. AT: "living according to their own sinful desires" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Where is the promise of his return?** - The mockers ask this rhetorical question to emphasize that they do not believe that Jesus will return. The word "promise" refers to the fulfillment of the promise that Jesus will return. AT: "The promise that Jesus would return is not true! He will not return!" (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **all things remain the same since the beginning of creation** - The mockers argue that since nothing in the world has ever changed, it cannot be true that Jesus will return. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **since the beginning of creation** - "since God created the world"
