\v 9 Now, why do you cry out aloud?
\qIs there no king in you,
\qIs your counsellor perished,
\qThat pangs have taken hold of you as a woman in travail?
\q
\v 10 Be in pain
\qAnd labor to bring forth,
\qO daughter of Zion,
\qLike a woman in travail.
\qFor now you will you go out of the city,
\qDwell in the field,
\qAnd come to Babylon.
\qThere you will be rescued,
\qThere Yahweh will redeem you
\qFrom the hand of your enemies.
