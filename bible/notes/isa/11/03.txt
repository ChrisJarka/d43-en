===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Instead, he will judge the poor with righteousness and decide fairly for the humble of the earth**. – Messiah will not judge as earthyly judges do.  He will judge the poor and humble according to God’s laws.
  * **He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked **- The rod in Messiah's mouth shows that he will rule over all the people of the earth.  The fact that he kills the wicked with the breath of his lips shows the power he will have in judging evil.  “ He will pronounce his sentence against the wicked and will execute them” (see:Metonymy)
  * **Righteousness will be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt around his hips**  – “Firm adherence to God’s law will characterize his rule" -See:Metaphor
