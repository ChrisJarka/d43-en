\q
\v 13 So are the paths of all that forget God;
\q And the hope of the godless man shall perish:
\q
\v 14 Whose confidence shall break in sunder,
\q And whose trust is a spiderâ€™s web.
\q
\v 15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand:
\q He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.
