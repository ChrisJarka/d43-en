\v 12 Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, saying, “What have you to do with me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?”
\v 13 The king of the people of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land, when he
came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan; now therefore, restore those
lands again in peace.”
