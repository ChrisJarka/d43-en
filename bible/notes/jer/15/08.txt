<usfm>
\v 8 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas; I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men
a destroyer at noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.
\v 9 She that has borne seven languisheth; she has given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she has
been put to shame and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, says Jehovah.
