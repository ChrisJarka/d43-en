\v 1 The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.
\p
\v 2 Beloved, I pray that in all things you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospereth.
\v 3 For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness to your truth, even as you walk in truth.
\v 4 Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.
\p
\v 5 Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you do toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;
\v 6 who bare witness to your love before the church: whom you will do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:
\v 7 because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
\v 8 We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.
\p
\v 9 I wrote somewhat to the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
\v 10 Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not
content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbids and throws
them out of the church.
\v 11 Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God: he that does evil has
not seen God.
\v 12 Demetrius has the witness of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness; and you know
that our witness is true.

\v 13 I had many things to write to thee, but I am unwilling to write
them to you with ink and pen:
\v 14 but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace
be to thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.
