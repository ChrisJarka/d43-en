\v 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, seeing his miraculous signs which he did.
\v 24 But Jesus would not trust himself to them, because he knew all people,
\v 25 and because he did not need that any one should testify concerning man, for he himself knew what was in man.
