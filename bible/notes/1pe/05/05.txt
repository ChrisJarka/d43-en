<usfm>
\v 5  Now I will say this to you young men. You must obey the older men in the assembly. All of you believers should act humbly toward each other, because this statement is true:
\q "God opposes people who are proud, 
\q but he acts kindly toward those who are humble."
\p
\v 6 Therefore, realizing that God has great power to punish proud people, humble yourselves in order that he may honor you at the time that he has determined.
\v 7 Because he takes care of you, let him take care of all the things that you are worried about.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 In the same way, you younger men, submit to the older men. All of you gird yourselves with humility and serve one another, for 
\q God resists the proud, 
\q but he gives grace to the humble.
\v 6 Therefore humble yourselves under God's mighty hand so that he may exalt you in due time.
\v 7 Cast all your anxiety upon him, because he cares for you.
