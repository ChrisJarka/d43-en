\p
\v 6 Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.
\v 7 And Jehovah said to Satan, Whence come thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
\v 8 And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast you considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and turns away from evil.
