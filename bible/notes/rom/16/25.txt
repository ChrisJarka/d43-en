\v 25 As I proclaim the Good News about Jesus Christ, I tell about God, the one who is able to strengthen you spiritually. I also proclaim the truth that God did not reveal  in any age before our own time.
\v 26 Now, however, he has made it know by means of what the Scriptures said would happen. He has done this so that people in all the people-groups in the world may believe in Christ and obey him.
