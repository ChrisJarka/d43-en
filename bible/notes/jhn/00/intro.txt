=== Who wrote the Book of John? ===

The Book of John is one of four books in the New Testament that describe the life of Jesus Christ.  Each one of them is called a “gospel,” which means “good news” and tells about the life and the teaching of Jesus Christ from a different point of view. John wrote about the purpose for his gospel: “that people might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God” (20:30-31).  But John’s gospel is very different in style (the way it is written) and in its content (what it includes or excludes) from the other three gospels. John’s Gospel focused on the “signs” Jesus did to prove his claims, and to establish his credibility by doing wonderful miracles.
