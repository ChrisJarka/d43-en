Merism is referring to something by listing some of its parts or by speaking of two extreme parts of it.

==== Description ====

Merism is referring to something by listing some of its parts or by speaking of two extreme parts of it.

**in heaven or in earth** (Deuteronomy 3:24 ULB)\\
"Heaven" and "earth" include everything that exists.

**Reason this is a translation issue**\\
Some readers may think that the phrase only applies to the items mentioned and not to items not mentioned.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

**__From the rising of the sun to its setting__, Yahweh's name should be praised.** (Psalm 113:3 ULB)\\
This underlined phrase is a merism because it speaks of the east and the west and everywhere in between. It means "everywhere."

**They will __stagger__ __from sea to sea__; they will __run__ __from the north to the east__ to seek the word of Yahweh** (Amos 8:12 ULB)\\
This sentence contains two merisms. "Stagger" and "run" are a merism because "stagger" is the slowest a person can move on foot, while "run" is the fastest. Included are those who simply walk or move by other means.\\
"From sea to sea" and "from the north to the east" form another merism because a person standing at Bethel, where Amos was preaching, would look south to the Dead Sea, west to the Mediterranean Sea, then north, then east. That is, he would look in all directions.

===== Translation Strategies =====

If leaving the merism in would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider doing so. If not, here are other options:
  - State specifically what the merism includes.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. State specifically what the merism includes.

  * **__in heaven or in earth__** (Deuteronomy 3:24 ULB)
    * "__anywhere at all__"

  * **From the __rising__ of the sun to its __setting__, Yahweh's name should be praised.** (Psalm 113:3 ULB)
    * "__At all times and in all places__, people should praise Yahweh."

  * **They will __stagger__ __from sea to sea__; they will __run__ __from the north to the east__ to seek the word of Yahweh** (Amos 8:12 ULB)
    * "They will __go about__ __from everywhere in all directions__ to seek the word of Yahweh"
