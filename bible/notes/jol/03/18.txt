\v 18 It will be in that day,
\q That the mountains will drip with sweet wine,
\q The hills will flow with milk,
\q All the brooks of Judah will flow with water,
\q And a fountain will come from the house of Yahweh
\q And water the valley of Shittim.
\q
\v 19 Egypt will be a desolation,
\q And Edom a desolate wilderness,
\q For the violence done to the children of Judah,
\q Because they shed innocent blood in their land.
