\v 4 And he said to me, Son of man, go, get you to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.
\v 5 For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;
\v 6 not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, if I sent
you to them, they would listen to you.
\v 7 But the house of Israel will not listen to thee; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are of
hard forehead and of a stiff heart.
