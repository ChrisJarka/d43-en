===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 But \add you\add*, my friends, are not dependable.
\q2 You are like streams: They spill over their banks \add in the spring\add*
\q1
\v 16 when \add the melting\add* ice and snow make those streams overflow,
\q1
\v 17 but when the dry season comes, there is no water flowing \add in those streams\add*,
\q2 and the channels dry up.
\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 15 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,
\q As the channel of brooks that pass away;
\q
\v 16 Which are black by reason of the ice,
\q And wherein the snow hides itself:
\q
\v 17 What time they wax warm, they vanish;
\q When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
