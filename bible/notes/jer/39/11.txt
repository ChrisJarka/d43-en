\v 11 King Nebuchadnezzar had previously told Nebuzaradan to find me. He said,
\v 12 "Make sure that no one harms him. Take care of him, and do for him whatever he requests you to do."
\v 13 So he and Nebushazban, who was one of their chief officers, and Nergal-Sharezer the king's advisor, and other officers of the king of Babylon
\v 14 sent some men to bring me out of the courtyard outside of the palace. They took me to Gedaliah who was the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. Then Gedaliah took me to my home, and I stayed in Judah among my own people \add who had been allowed to remain there\add*.

\v 11 Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
\v 12 Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him even as he shall say to thee.
\v 13 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the chief
officers of the king of Babylon;
\v 14 they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of
Shaphan, that he should carry him home. So he lived among the people.
