\v 20 My fellow believers, stop being like little children in the way that you think \add about these abilities that God's Spirit gives\add*. Instead, think about them in a mature way. If you really want to be like little children, do as few wicked things as babies do!
\v 21 \add When the Jews long ago refused to obey God, he warned them about what would happen when he allowed their enemies to punish them\add*. In the Scriptures it is written \f + \ft Or:\add the prophet Isaiah\add* wrote \f* what the Lord \add God\add* said \add about that\add*,
\q \add They didn't listen to prophets speaking their own language, so I will send\add* people from foreign \add lands to attack\add* my people.
\q Those foreigners will speak languages that my people do not know \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q \add In that way\add*, I will warn my people,
\q but they will still not pay attention to what I say.

\v 20 Brothers and sisters, do not be child-like as you consider your life and faith, but be mature and wise. But when you consider evil, you should be callow and inexperienced about what is it and how it operates in your life, just like infants that are innocent and have little to do with evil, because they are inexperienced and unlearned. But in your assessment of the implications of evil and its schemes working around and trying to capture you, you should have real wisdom and full maturity in dealing with evil to keep it as a defeated power in your life and to keep far away from the way you live.
\v 21 In the law it is written, 
\q "By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers 
\q1 I will speak to this people; 
\q and even then they will not hear me," 
\m says the Lord
