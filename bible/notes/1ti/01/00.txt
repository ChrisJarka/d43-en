====== 1 Timothy 01 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Spiritual children ==
Paul calls Timothy his "son." Paul was very involved in discipling Timothy in his faith. Therefore, he called him his "spiritual" son. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).

== Genealogies ==

This is probably a reference to some group's speculation over who the [[:en:obe:kt:christ|messiah]] could possible be. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Play-on-words ==
The phrase "the law is good if one uses it lawfully" is a pun or play-on-words. Law and lawfully both sound the same.
