\v 22 He replied, "While the baby was still alive, I fasted and cried. I thought, 'Who knows? Yahweh may act mercifully toward me and not allow the baby to die'.
\v 23 But now the baby is dead.

\v 21 Then his servants said to him, "Why have you done this? You fasted  and wept for the child while it was alive, but when the child died, you got up and ate.
\v 22 David answered, "While the child was still alive I fasted and wept. I said, "Who knows whether or not Yahweh will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
\v 23 But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me."

===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:grace]]
 
===== Translation Notes: =====

   * **Why have you done this?** - This is **__NOT a__** [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] because the **__servants were expecting an answer__** which David gave in the next sentence.
   * **Who knows whether or not Yahweh will be gracious to me, that the child may live?** - This is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] because nobody knew for sure whether God would have changed His mind in response to the prayer.
   * **now he is dead, why should I fast?** - This is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] because there is obviously no reason to try to continue to save the child's life after death.
   * **Can I bring him back again?** - This is also a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] because David obviously could not bring the child back from the dead.
