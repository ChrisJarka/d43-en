\v 1 And there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the
trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O
Israel.
\v 2 So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah clave
to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
