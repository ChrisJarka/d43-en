\v 35 So that night Yahweh fulfilled his words, because the angel of Yahweh went out and struck the camp of the Assyrians, putting to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand soldiers. When the men arose early in the morning, breathlessly, dead bodies lay everywhere.
\v 36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria left Israel and went home and stayed in Nineveh.
\v 37 Later, as Sennacherib was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.
