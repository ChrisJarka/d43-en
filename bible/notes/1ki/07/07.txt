===== Translation Notes: =====

The author writes about the Hall of the Throne, also called the hall of justice.

    * **hall of the throne where he was to judge** and **the hall of justice**  - This is the place where the king sat to make judgments. Both references mean the same thing.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) 
    * **from floor to floor** - An interlinear translation reads "from one side of the floor to the other". The UDB suggests this is from the floor to the ceiling rafters.
