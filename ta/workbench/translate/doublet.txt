A doublet is a pair of words used together that mean the nearly the same nearly thing. This is often done to emphasize or intensify their meaning. In some languages people do not use doublets for this. They may need to find some other way to emphasize or intensify the meaning.
===== Description =====
We are using the word doublet to refer to two words or very short phrases that mean the same thing and that are used in the same phrase. Often they are joined with the word “and.” This is often used to emphasize or intensify the idea expressed by the two words.  

**Reason this is a translation issue:** In some languages people do not use doublets to emphasize or intensify the idea expressed by the two phrases. Or they may use doublets, but they may do it for a reason that would not fit in a particular verse. 
 
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**King David was old and advanced in years.** (1 Kings 1:1)  \\ 
This means that he was “very old.” 

**he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself** 1 Kings 2:32  
This means that they were “much more righteous” than he was. 

**You have decided to prepare false and deceptive words** (Daniel 2:9)
This means that they had prepared “many false things to say”. 

**as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.** 1 Peter 1:19  \\ 
This means that he was like a lamb that did not have any blemish--not even one. 
 
===== Translation Strategies ===== 
If your language uses doublets in order to emphasize or intensify an idea, consider using them. If not, consider these strategies. 
 
  - Translate only one of the phrases and add a word that intensifies it such as “very” or “great” or “many”. 
  - Use your own culture's way of emphasizing or intensifying a concept. 
 
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ===== 
1. Translate only one of the phrases and add a word that intensifies it such as “very” or “great” or “many”. 
  * **You have decided to prepare false and deceptive words** (Daniel 2:9 ) 
    * "You have decided to prepare many false things to say”. 

2. Use your own culture's way of emphasizing or intensifying the concept. 
  * **a lamb without blemish and without spot.** (1 Peter 1:19) - English can emphasize this with "any" and "at all." 
    * "a lamb without any blemish at all"
