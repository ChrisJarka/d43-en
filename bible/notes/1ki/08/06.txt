\v 6 The priests brought in the Sacred Chest of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the inner room of the temple, to the very holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
\v 7 For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the Sacred Chest, and the cherubim covered the Sacred Chest and the poles by which it was carried.
\v 8 The poles were so long that their  ends were seen from the holy place in front of the very holy place, but they could not be seen from outside. They are there to this day.
