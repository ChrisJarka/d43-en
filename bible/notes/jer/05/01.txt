\q If you can find a man or there is anyone performing justice, seeking the truth – 
\q Then I will forgive her!

\q
\v 3 Yahweh, aren’t your eyes towards truth? You strike them, but they do not feel pain;
\q You finish them off; they refuse to receive discipline! They harden their faces harder than cliff sides refusing to repent!
