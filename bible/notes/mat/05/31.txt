\v 31 "God has said in the scriptures, 'If a man is divorcing his wife, he should write a document on which he states that he is divorcing her.'
\v 32 But now listen to what I say to you: a man may divorce his wife only if she has committed adultery. If a man divorces his wife for any other reason, she commits adultery if she marries someone else. And the man who marries her also commits adultery."

\v 31 It was also said, 'Whoever sends his wife away, let him give her a certificate of divorcement.'
\v 32 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the cause of fornication, makes her an 
adulteress; and whoever marries her after she has been divorced commits adultery.
