====== What Else Must I Do? [28-03] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-28-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

But the young man said, “I have **[[:en:obe:other:obey|obeyed]]** all these **[[:en:obe:kt:gods-law|laws]]** **ever since I was a boy**. **What do I still need to do** in order to live forever?” **[[:en:obe:kt:jesus|Jesus]]** looked at him and **[[:en:obe:kt:love|loved]] him**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **ever since I was a boy** – Another way to say this would be, “from the time I was a child until now.”
  * **What do I still need to do?** - That is, "What else do I need to do" or, "What do I need to do in addition to these?"
  * **loved him** - Jesus had compassion on him. Choose a word for love that is consistent with the kind of love God has for people.
