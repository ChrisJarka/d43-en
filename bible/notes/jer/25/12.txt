\v 12 Then it will be when seventy years have been completed, I will visit the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans—this is Yahweh’s declaration—for their iniquity, and make it a perpetual desolation.
\v 13 Then I will bring about all my words that I declared and everything written in this report that Jeremiah prophesied concerning all the nations against this land.
\v 14 For also many nations and great kings will make servants of them, and I will require payment from them according to their deeds and the works of their hands.
