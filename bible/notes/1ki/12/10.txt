\v 10 And the young men that were grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you say to this people that spoke
to thee, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus shall you speak to them, My little
finger is thicker than my fatherâ€™s loins.
\v 11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips,
but I will chastise you with scorpions.
