**NOTE: The translationAcademy manuals can be translated using either the translationStudio-Desktop program or on the git.door43.org website. It is the decision of the translation team which interface to use. **

==== Using translationStudio-Desktop ====

=== Create a translationAcademy Project ===

From any screen in the program, click on the 3-dot menu icon found in the bottom left corner of the window.
  * Click on the word "Home."
  * Add a new project by clicking on the blue circle with a plus sign (+) in the top right corner of the window.
    * Choose a target language.
    * Choose **translationAcademy Vol 1** or **translationAcademy Vol 2** in the next window. The Project opens.

**Note**: Only if the program is set up to do Gateway Languages will you see the projects 'translationWords', '**translationAcademy Vol 1**', or '**translationAcademy Vol 2**.' See: [[ en:ta:vol2:tech:tSd_settings]] for more information.

=== Start the translationAcademy Project ===

There are two panels displayed in the translationAcademy project window:
  - The source text in the left panel.
  - The target language translation will be in the right panel.

=== Translate the translationAcademy ===

  * Translate the title of the translationAcademy topic in the top section on the right panel. 
    * Left click above the red line on the 'Translate title here' words.
    * Type in the translation of the translationAcademy title.
  * Translate the information for the translationAcademy.
    * Left click on the words 'Translate text here' and start typing the translation.

Write translations that will help the Other Language translators understand translation guidelines and strategies.


=== Mark the tA Topic as Done and Go to the Next topic ===

When the translator feels that all the information has been written for the translationWord:
  * Click on the slider at the bottom right of the term to mark the word as 'done.'
  * Click on 'Confirm' in the pop-up window.

Continue to the next tW until all of the translationWords are complete. 



==== Using the git.door43.org site ====

=== Terms to Know ===
**Fork** - to fork something is to make a branch of the master. Think of a path. This path has a split so the person walking down the path can either go to the right or stay on the main path. This is a fork in the path. \\
**Repo** - this is short for 'repository.' A repository is where all the files from a project is stored. 


=== 1. Sign onto the Git website ===
  * Go to https://git.door43.org/
  * Click on the Sign In link.
  * Sign into the site using the same Door43 Account as is used with translationStudio.
The website opens to the Dashboard of the account.

=== 2. Go to the English translationAcademy site ===
  * Click on the word 'Explore' in the top menu.
  * Type in en-ta in the search bar.
  * Click on the Search button.
There will be a list of the repositories for translationAcademy manuals. There are 9 repos in Door43. 
  - en-ta
  - en-ta-intro
  - en-ta-process
  - en-ta-translate-vol1
  - en-ta-translate-vol2
  - en-ta-checking-vol1
  - en-ta-checking-vol2
  - en-ta-gl
  - en-ta-audio
Look for only the repos that start with Door43/ before the manual - such as: Door43/en-ta.
