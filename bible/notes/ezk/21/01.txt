===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Son of man**  - "Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is powerful and lives forever, but people are not. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human" 
  * **the word of Yahweh came to me** - "Yahweh gave me a message." See how you translated this phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:01:01|1:1]]. 
  * **set your face toward Jerusalem** - This is an idiom. This means to that Yahweh is casting judgement upon Jerusalem and is telling Ezekiel to look toward Jerusalem and speak his judgement against it. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:06|4:7]]. AT: "look in judgement upon Jerusalem" or "look towards Jerusalem with judgement" 
  * **I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off both the righteous person and the wicked person from you** - This speaks of Yahweh causing these people to die as if he actually killed them with his own sword. AT: "I am opposed to you, and it will be as though I pull my sword from its sheath to kill both the righteous and the wicked people among you" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * ** the righteous person and the wicked person**  -  "righteous people and wicked people." This refers to multiple people, not just one righteous person and one wicked person.
  * **sheath** - something that holds and covers a sword when no one is using it 
  * **cut off* - This is a euphemism that means to kill. AT: "kill" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
