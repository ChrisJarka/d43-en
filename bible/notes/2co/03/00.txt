====== 2 Corinthians 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Paul continues his defense

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

**Paul continues his defense**

Paul does not need recommendations because the Corinthian Christians are proof of his work. God enabled him to bring the work of the Holy Spirit that gives life and is more glorious than the Law of Moses that brings death to people. People understand the message of the Spirit but do not understand the writings of Moses.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

**Rhetorical question**

The chapter begins with two [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]s affirming that they know what he is like.

**Metaphor** 

“written on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts” is a historic reference to the ten commandments given to Moses on stone tablets.
“Servants of the covenant” means he bring the new covenant of being saved by Christ’s death.
“The veil” means not understanding.

**Metonymy**

“the letter kills”, “the work of death”, “work of condemnation” are all [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]: for the Law of Moses.
the work of the Spirit and the service of righteousness are metonymies for new life in Christ.
 


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

There are many allusions to God giving the Law to Moses in Exodus 20. People who do not already know this story will need much more implicit information to help people to understand.
