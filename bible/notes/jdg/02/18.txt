\v 18 Whenever Yahweh brought a leader to them, he helped that leader and enabled his to rescue the people from their enemies. He did that as long as that leader was alive. Yahweh pitied them as they groaned because they were being oppressed and caused to suffer.
\v 19 But after that leader died, the people went back to behaving in more evil ways than their ancestors had behaved. They worshiped other gods and bowed down to them and did all \f + \ft litotes \f* the things that they thought those gods wanted them to do.

\v 18 And when Jehovah raised them up judges, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies
all the days of the judge: for it repented Jehovah because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed
them.
\v 19 But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in
following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they ceased not from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.
