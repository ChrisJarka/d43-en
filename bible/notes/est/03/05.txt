\v 5 When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or bow down to him, he became extremely angry.
\v 6 He knew that he should not lay a hand on Mordecai by himself. There were many things to be considered. Mordecai had made it known that he was Jewish. Haman wanted all the Jews to be killed. So this was an opportunity to kill all the Jews, not just Mordecai, from all the kingdom of Ahasuerus.
