===== Translation Notes: =====

The woman's lover continues speaking to himself.

  * **Who is this who** - The lover uses this question to emphasize that he thinks that the woman is amazing. AT: "This is an amazing woman who." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **appears like the dawn** - "looks out like the dawn" or "shows up like the dawn." The lover uses this image to say that the woman is as beautiful and as majestic as the dawn when it begins to shine. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **completely fascinating** - See how you translated "completely fascinating to me" in [[en:bible:notes:sng:06:04|6:4]].
