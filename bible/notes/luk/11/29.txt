\p
\v 29  And when the crowds were gathering even more, *  He began to say, "This generation is evil. It seeks a sign and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah."
And when the crowds were gathering together to him, he began to say, This generation is an evil generation: it seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah.

\v 30  For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so too the Son of Man shall be to this generation." *
For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
