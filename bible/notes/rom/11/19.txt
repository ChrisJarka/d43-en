\v 19 If one of you then says, "\add God rejected the Jews\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like\add* branches \f + \ft metaphor \f* that are broken \f + \ft Or:that people broke \f* off \add a tree and rejected\add*, in order that \add he might accept us non-Jews, as\add* branches \f + \ft metaphor \f* of a tree are grafted in \f + \ft Or:\add as people\add* graft in branches of a tree \f*,"
\v 20 \add I would reply that\add* this is true. However, it is because the Jews did not believe \add in Christ\add* that they were rejected \f + \ft metaphor \f* \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* rejected \f + \ft metaphor \f* them \f*. As for you, it is \add only\add* because you believe \add in Christ\add* that \add God has accepted\add* you! \add So\add* do not \add any of you\add* become proud, but instead beware \add of what could happen to you\add*!
\v 21 Since God did not spare \add the unbelieving Jews\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add who were like a tree's\add* natural branches, he will not spare any of you \add if you do\add* not\add keep trusting in him!\add*

\v 19 You will say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
\v 20 Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
\v 21 for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.
