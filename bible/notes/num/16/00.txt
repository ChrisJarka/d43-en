== Some Levites revolt ==

Some of the Levites said that they were as good as Moses and Aaron and could do the temple work. So Moses told them to come to the sacred tent and burn incense to God. God then burned them up and made the earth open up and the leaders and their families fell in and the earth closed again. That way God showed that only the priests could do the temple work.
