**What is 1 Samuel about?**

This book is focused on three individuals: Samuel, Saul, and David. Samuel was the last of the judges over Israel. Israel chose Saul as their first king. Saul’s rise and fall take up much narrative found in 1 Samuel. After Saul, David was the king of Israel.

**How should the title of this book be translated?**  \\ 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or to follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "1 Samuel" is named after the leader of Israel when the book first begins. It is likely that the books of 1 and 2 Samuel were originally one book but were separated because they could not be printed together in one volume. One possible title is "The Book about Samuel and Saul."

**Who wrote 1 Samuel?**\\
The book of Samuel likely contains many different historical accounts which were put together. It is likely that Samuel began the material in the book. The book could not have been finished earlier the death of David's son, Solomon.

**What was the purpose of 1 Samuel?**\\
The book of 1 Samuel contains a great amount of information about on the growth of Israel into a nation and the beginning of the kingly rule in Israel. There also appears to be other purposes in the author's writing. The author may have sought to defend David's right to rule over Saul and to condemn the actions of northern tribes who would become the kingdom of Israel. It is likely that the author wrote at a time when the nation of Israel was in a civil war and supported the kingdom of Judah.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
**Was the king of Israel different than the kings of other nations?**\\
Yes, the king of of Israel was meant to be different from the kings of other nations. In other nations, the king was a political and military leader. In Israel, the king was a spiritual leader as well. This is one of the things that separates Saul and David.

**Was there another covenant that begins in 2 Samuel?**\\
2 Samuel 7 records another covenant between Israel and David. The Lord promised to make David's [[:en:obe:kt:name|name]] great, a safe home for Israel, that David's descendants would rule Israel forever.

**Who is Yahweh's [[:en:obe:kt:anoint|anointed]]?**\\
There are many references in 1 Samuel to Yahweh's anointed. This is a reference to the one whom Yahweh has chosen to be the king of [[:en:obe:kt:peopleofgod|his people]]. Ultimately, this book looks forward to a time when a descendant of David, who is Yahweh's anointed, the [[:en:obe:kt:christ|Messiah]] will come and be Yahweh's king. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**What is a shepherd?**\\
A shepherd was a common image for a king in the ancient Near East and is a frequent comparison in Scripture. If "shepherd" is unknown in your culture, extra care must be taken must be taken to ensure it remains true to the many functions of a shepherd in Scripture. (See: Biblical Imagery)??    

**Is there a formula for cursing in 1 Samuel?**\\
There are many instances of curses in 1 and 2 Samuel (1 Sam 3:17; 14:44; 20:13; 25:22; 2 Sam 3:9, 35; 19:13).  These curse do not follow a strict form but they do appear to have a formal or structure sound to them.

**What is the meaning of the term Israel?**\\
Israel is used in many different ways in Scripture. The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel.  This people group is also the [[:en:obe:other:israel|nation of Israel]]. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, which is a reference to the "[[:en:obe:other:kingdomofisrael|kingdom of Israel]]." 1 Samuel references both the northern kingdom of Israel and the whole nation of Israel as "Israel". This can cause confusion because the civil war has not begun at this point in the history of Israel (1 Samuel 17:52; 18:16).
