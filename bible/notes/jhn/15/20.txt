\v 20 Remember these words that I told you: 'No servant is greater than his master.' \add That means that you, who are like my servants, cannot expect people to treat you better than they treat me\add*. So, since they have persecuted me\f + \ft Or: caused me to suffer \f*, they will persecute you\f + \ft Or: cause you to suffer \f* also. If they had paid attention to the things I taught them, they would pay attention to what you teach them.
\v 21 They will treat you like that because you \add belong to\add* me \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and because they do not know the one who sent me.
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken \add God's message\add* to them, they would not be guilty \add of rejecting me and my message\add*. But now \add I have come and told them God's message, so\add* they will have no excuse \add when God judges them\add* for their sin.

\v 20 Remember the word that I said to you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also
persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
\v 21 But all these things will they do to you for my nameâ€™s sake, because they know not him that sent me.
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.
