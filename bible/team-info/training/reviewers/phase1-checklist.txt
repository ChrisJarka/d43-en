====== Phase 1 Reviewer Checklist ======

Before publishing Phase 1 tN's, the reviewer should refer to the topics below.

==== Notes to Remove ====

  * Remove tN's that state information that is plainly obvious.

  * Remove tN's that are adequately clear in the UDB.

  * Remove tN's with commentary, devotional, or teaching content that does not directly help with the process of translation.

  * Remove Important Words that are not found in the ULB.


==== Notes to Correct ====

  * Correct the formatting of notes.

  * Correct tN's that are wrong (saying a plural is singular, for ex.).

  * Correct Important Terms that are not correctly linked, or that point to the wrong pages.

  * Correct Translation Academy (tA) links that are not formatted correctly, or that point to the wrong pages.

  * Simplify wording of tN's where possible.


==== Notes to Add ====

  * Add __brief__ tN's for important issues that are not addressed in the tN's.

  * Add notes to indicate significant optional meanings for phrases, if not in the tN's.

  * Add links to significant Important Terms that are not already linked.

  * Add links to important tA topics that are not already included.


==== Communication with Teams ====
