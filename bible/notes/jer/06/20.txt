\v 20 "What does this frankincense going up from Sheba mean to me? Or these sweet smells from a distant land?
\q Your burnt offerings are not acceptable to me, nor are your sacrifices.
\q
\v 21 So Yahweh says this, 'See, I am about to place a stumbling block against this people.
\q They will stumble over itâ€”fathers and sons together. Inhabitants and their neighbors will also perish.'
\q
\v 22 Yahweh says this, 'See, a people is coming from the land of the north,
\q a great nation is being stirred up from the farthest parts of the earth.
