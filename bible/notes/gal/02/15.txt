<usfm>
\v 15 Some of us believers were born as Jews. We were not born as non-Jews. We Jews have always considered non-Jews to be 'sinners' because they do not obey the Jewish rituals and laws.
\v 16 But we now know that it is not because some person obeys the laws that God gave to Moses that God erases the record of that person's sins. God erases the record of a person's sins only if that person trusts in what Jesus Christ has done. Even we Jews trusted Christ Jesus. We did that in order that God would erase the record of our sins because of our trusting Christ, and not because of our obeying the laws that God gave to Moses. God has said that he will never erase the record of people's sins just because of their obeying those laws.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 We who are Jews by birth and not "Gentile sinners"
\v 16 know that God does not justify anyone  by the works of the law but through trusting in Jesus Christ. We believe in Christ Jesus in order that God might justify us because we trust in Christ, not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law God will not justify anyone.
