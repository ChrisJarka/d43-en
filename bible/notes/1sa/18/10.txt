\v 10 And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst
of the house: and David played with his hand, as he did day by day. And Saul had his spear in his hand;
\v 11 and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will strike David even to the wall. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
\v 12 And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and was departed from Saul.
