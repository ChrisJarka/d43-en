===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 I have heard those prophets prophesy lies, saying that they are telling people messages from me \f + \ft metonymy \f*. They say, '\add Listen to me tell you\add* the dream I received \add from God last night\add*! I really had this dream!'
\v 26 How long will they continue to do this? How long will those lying prophets continue to prophesy things that come only from their own minds?
\v 27 They think that because of the dreams that they tell to each other, people will forget me \f + \ft metonymy \f*, like their ancestors forgot about me when they started to worship Baal.

\v 25 I have heard what the prophets have said, those who were prophesying deceit in my name. They said, 'I had a dream! I had a dream!'
\v 26 How long will this go on, prophets who prophesy lies from their minds, and who prophesy from the deceit in their hearts?
\v 27 They are planning on making my people forget my name with the dreams that they report, each one to his neighbor, just as their ancestors forgot my name in favor of Baal's name.
