====== Introductions to the translationAcademy Just-In-Time Pages ======

=== Step One: ===
**The assignment of the page to Jody and Carli.**\\
1. At this point Jody and Carli will work together to create a 100 words, or less, introduction to the topic covered on the page. These introductions should provide the following:
  * Entice the learner to want to learn about the topic.
  * Provide a preview of the topic that can also function as a refresher for those who already may know it.
2. Change the tag to introsq 

^ Jody ^ Carli ^ 
|{{door43pages @en:ta:workbench -q="\{\{tag>[^}]*introjg[^}]*\}\}" -r -showcount -title -simpleLineBreak}}|{{door43pages  @en:ta:workbench -q="\{\{tag>[^}]*introcs[^}]*\}\}" -r -showcount -title -simpleLineBreak}} |

=== Step Two: ===
**The assignment of the page to Susan.**\\
At this point Susan will read over the introductions and will either:
  * Submit to Kara to do an ELL check - change tag to introka
  * Make minor changes and then submit to Kara - change tag to introka
  * Tag the page with reviewjg (for Jody) and/or reviewcs (for Carli) and add comments to the discussion area. Jody and/or Carli will then review the comments and make adjustments to the introduction. When done, respond to Susan's post in the discussion panel and change the tag to introsq.

^ Susan ^ Kara ^ Jody ^ Carli ^
|{{door43pages @en:ta:workbench -q="\{\{tag>[^}]*introsq[^}]*\}\}" -r -showcount -title -simpleLineBreak}}|{{door43pages  @en:ta:workbench -q="\{\{tag>[^}]*introka[^}]*\}\}" -r -showcount -title -simpleLineBreak}} |{{door43pages @en:ta:workbench -q="\{\{tag>[^}]*reviewjg[^}]*\}\}" -r -showcount -title -simpleLineBreak}}|{{door43pages  @en:ta:workbench -q="\{\{tag>[^}]*reviewcs[^}]*\}\}" -r -showcount -title -simpleLineBreak}} |

===Step Three: ===
**The assignment of the page to Chris.**\\
At this point the page is ready for uploading to the Vol 1 or Vol 2 page.
  * Submit to Kara to make the change on the Vol 1 or Vol 2 page - change tag to introcj
  * Make minor changes and then submit to Chris - change tag to introcj
