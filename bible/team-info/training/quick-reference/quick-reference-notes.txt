==== Figures of Speech ====

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:apostrophe|Apostrophe]]** - In apostrophe, a speaker turns his attention from the people he is speaking to and makes an exclamation to someone who is not there with them.

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:doublet|Doublet]]** - In a doublet two words or short phrases that mean basically the same thing are used together–-typically, as a way to reinforce the concept. The two words are often joined with “and.” In the Bible, doublets are often used in poetry, prophecy, and sermons. 

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:euphemism|Euphemism]]** - A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant or embarrassing. Its purpose is to avoid offending the people who hear or read it.

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:hendiadys|Hendiadys]]** - In hendiadys a single idea is expressed with two words connected with “and,” when one word could be used to modify the other.

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:hyperbole|Hyperbole]]** - A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker’s feeling or opinion about something.

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:idiom|Idiom]]** - An idiom is a group of words that has a meaning that is different from what one would understand from the meanings of the individual words.

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:litotes|Litotes]]** - Litotes is a strong statement made by negative phrases to strengthen a positive meaning (e.g. “You won't be disappointed” means “You will like it”).

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metaphor|Metaphor]]** - A metaphor is a figure of speech in which words for one thing or action are applied to something else in order to imply that there is something that the two things have in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it.

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metonymy|Metonymy]]** - Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. A metonym is a word or phrase used as a substitute for something it is associated with.

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:parallelism|Parallelism]]** - In parallelism two clauses that are similar in grammatical structure or idea are used together. Sometimes the two clauses mean basically the same thing, sometimes the second clarifies the meaning of the first, and sometimes the second says something that contrasts with the first.
We are writing notes for parallelism only when the two parts mean basically the same thing. \\

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:personification|Personification]]** - Personification is a kind of simile or metaphor, in which an idea or something that is not alive is referred to as if it were a person and could do the things people do or have the attributes people have.

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:rhetorical -question|Rhetorical Question]]** - A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. Often it indicates the speaker’s attitude toward the topic or the listener. Often it is used for rebuking or scolding, but some languages have other purposes as well.

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:simile]]** - 
In a simile something is compared to something else of a different kind in order to focus on a particular trait that they have in common. The fact that there is a comparison is stated clearly with ‘like’ or ‘as’.

**[[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:synecdoche|Synecdoche]]** - Synecdoche is a figure of speech in which 1) the name of a part of something is used to refer to the whole thing, or 2) the name of a whole thing is used to refer to just one part of it.
