\v 44 And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits,
and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the
priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
\v 45 And they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and
so did the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
