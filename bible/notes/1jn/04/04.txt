\v 4 As for you who are very dear to me, you belong to God, and you have refused \add the false messages\add* that those people \add teach\add*, because \add God\add*, who enables you \add to do what he wants\add*, is greater\f + \ft Or: more powerful \f* than \add Satan\f + \ft Or: the devil\add* \f*, who enables godless people\f + \ft Or: people who conduct their lives in a way that displeases God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 5 As for \add those who are teaching what is false\add*, they are godless people\f + \ft Or: people whose lives are displeasing to God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Because of that, they teach what godless people\f + \ft Or: people whose lives are displeasing to God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f* want to hear. That is why the godless people\f + \ft Or: people whose lives displease God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f* listen to them.
\v 6 As for us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, \add because\add* we belong to God, whoever knows\f + \ft Or: has a close relationship with \f* God listens to us. \add But\add* those who do not belong to God do not listen to us. That is how we can know whether \add the things that people are teaching\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* are true or whether they are false, and deceiving \add people\add*.

\v 4 You are of God, my little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.
\v 5 They are of the world: therefore speak they as of the world, and the world hears them.
\v 6 We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he who is not of God hears us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
