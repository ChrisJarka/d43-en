====== fruit ======


==== Definition: ====


Fruit is the edible food produced by a plant.  Fruit may also refer to the outcome of a person's spiritual habits.  Context will clearly define.


    * The Bible uses the concepts of "sowing" and "reaping" to describe spiritual behavior patterns in a person's life.
    * If you "sow" to your old nature, then you will "reap" death. If you "sow" to the spirit, then you will "reap" spiritual fruit.
    * The Bible lists the spiritual fruit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness and self control.
