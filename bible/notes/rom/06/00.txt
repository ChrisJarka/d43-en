Paul recalls the steep price paid for Christ for a christian's salvation as motivation for [[:en:obe:kt:godly|godly]] living.

== Servants of sin ==
Before coming to faith in Jesus, people are servants or slaves of sin. After salvation, a christian is freed from this bondage and is able to choose to serve Christ in their life. Paul explains that when a Christian chooses to sin, it is because the person has willingly chosen sin.
