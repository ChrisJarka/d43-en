====== Prophetic Quotation ======

===== Description =====

Prophets often quoted what God said. Sometimes it is clear when a prophet was quoting God because the text says "The Lord says." But often there is nothing indicating when God's speech has ended. Also prophets often quoted God without marking it at all. Different English translations put the quote marks in different places. Translators may follow the interpretations in the ULB or UDB or the interpretations of other translations that they have.


===== Notes for Beginning of Each Chapter =====

Prophets wrote God's messages to people. Sometimes they directly quoted God and sometimes they reported the information that God gave them. Sometimes it is not clear whether or not the prophet was directly quoting God.
