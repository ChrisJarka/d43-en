<usfm>
\q
\v 9 But then I will purify the lips of the peoples,
\q that all of them may call upon the name of Yahweh to serve him shoulder to shoulder.
\q
\v 10 From beyond the river of Ethiopia my worshipers—my scattered people—will bring offerings due me.
\q
\v 11 In that day you will not be put to shame for all your deeds that you committed against me,
\q since at that time I will remove from among you those who celebrated your pride,
\q and because you will no longer act arrogantly on my holy mountain.
