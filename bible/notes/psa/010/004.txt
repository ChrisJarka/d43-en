<usfm>
\v 4 The wicked people are very proud.
\q2 As a result, they do not seek \add help from\f + \ft Or: worship\add* \f* God;
\q2 they do not even think that God exists.
\q1
\v 5 But \add it seems that\add* they succeed in everything that they do.
\q2 They do not think that they will be condemned\f + \ft Or: punished \f* for their deeds,
\q2 and they sneer at\f + \ft Or: make fun of \f* their enemies.
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 The wicked people are very proud.
\q2 So they do not ask God for help;
\q2 they do not even think about him.
\q1
\v 5 But it seems that they succeed in everything that they do.
\q2 The things that you have commanded are too difficult for him to understand;
\q2 they mock their enemies.


\q1
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 Because the wicked man is so proud, he does not seek God.
\q He never thinks about God because he does not care at all about him.
\q
\v 5 He is secure at all times,
\q but your righteous decrees are too high for him;
\q he snorts at all his enemies.
</usfm>
