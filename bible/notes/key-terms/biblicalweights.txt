How to translate Biblical units for measuring weights:

  - <font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible.</font>
  - An important reason for using words that closely resemble the Biblical terms for measuring weights is to show that the Bible is an historical document and that real people used these units of measurement during that time period.
  - If it doesn't work to use the Bible term, then instead, state the same amount of weight using a unit of measure that is known.
