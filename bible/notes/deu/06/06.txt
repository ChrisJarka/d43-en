  * **will be in your heart** - Here the phrase "in your heart" refers to the thoughts or memory of someone. AT: "you must always remember" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **will diligently teach them ... up** - God's commandments are to be discussed by all the people of Israel anytime and anywhere. They are not just for the priests and Levites to discuss.
