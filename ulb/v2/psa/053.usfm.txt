\c 53
\d For the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath. Maschil of David.
\q
\v 1 The fool has said in his heart, There is no God.
\q Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity;
\q There is none that does good.
\q
\v 2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men,
\q To see if there were any that did understand,
\q That did seek after God.
\q
\v 3 Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy;
\q There is none that does good, no, not one.
\q
\v 4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge,
\q Who eat up my people as they eat bread,
\q And call not upon God?
\q
\v 5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was;
\q For God has scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee:
\q You have put them to shame, because God has rejected them.
\q
\v 6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!
\q When God brings back the captivity of his people,
\q Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
