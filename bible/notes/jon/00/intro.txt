===What is Jonah about?===

The book of Jonah is a biographical narrative, with the teaching purpose to show the inclusion of Gentiles in the mercy and grace of Yahweh, and their ability to respond to warnings with true repentance and worship of Yahweh. Some have tried to find allegory or fanciful aspects in the story, but it appears to be an account of the events in Jonah’s life. Jonah lived in the 8th century, during the time of King Jeroboam II (793-753 BC). He was given a mission to take a warning and to call the people of Nineveh to repentance, or Yahweh would destroy their city. Jonah, as a loyalist to Israel, chose not to do what Yahweh called him to do, and he ran away.
Jonah was a patriot to the nation of Israel (living in the Northern Kingdom, with Samaria as the chief city), and he did not want Gentiles (non-Jews) participating in the covenant of grace that Yahweh had shown to Israel and Judah. Jonah desired for Nineveh to fall (they were considered an enemy of Israel). Yet Yahweh sent him to Nineveh to call them to repent and to worship Yahweh.


===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Jonah" may also be called the "The book about Jonah."

===Who wrote Jonah?===

The author of Jonah is not known. It is likely that Jonah or someone close to him wrote the book.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
===How are Jonah and Elijah connected?===

There are many parallels between Jonah and the prophets Elijah and Elisha that should be studied. Each of these was sent to Gentile nations, Elijah to Sidon;  Elisha to Syria; and Jonah to Nineveh. Notice that Elijah and Jonah both suffered depression after their greatest victories. Elijah and Jonah both delivered messages that were more about destruction and defeat than about the grace of Yahweh. Elijah’s message from in 1 Kings 17:1b, “As Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there will not be dew or rain these years unless I say so.” See also Jonah’s message from Jonah 3:4b. “In forty days and Nineveh will be overthrown.” The oracles of Elijah and Jonah are surprisingly short and punctuated with an unspoken desire that their prophecies not be followed or that they bring terrible results to those who hear the message. The message of grace to the Gentiles is central to the New Testament message.

===Who was Assyria?===

During the time of Jonah, Assyria was the most powerful kingdom in the world. It was known for its ruthlessness. Eventually, God punished Assyria for its sin.

===Did Assyria convert to Judaism?===
While it is possible that the Assyrians came to worship Yahweh alone, it is likely that they continued to worship other [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]].


===Why is Yahweh concerned with a foreign nation?===

God shows [[:en:obe:kt:mercy|mercy]] to Assyria and Jonah implies that this mercy will be used by Assyria to destroy the nation of Israel. Jonah struggles with this greatly. What he fails to see is that God mercy towards the nation of Israel exceeds his mercy shown to Assyria. The reaction the people of Assyria to the prophet of Israel ([[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]]) is the reaction the people of Israel should have had to their own prophets.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

===Is Jonah written as narrative or a parable?===

Some people believe that the book of Jonah is a myth, fable or allegory. It is best for the translator to use language that treats the text as if the events actually happened. The writing style should follow a more narrative quality.

===Did Jonah get swallowed by a whale or big fish?===

For many years, English translations have translated this word as "whale," but it better to use the term "big fish."
