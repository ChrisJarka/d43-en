\v 20 And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him grievously; and he fell on the
ground, and wallowed foaming.
\v 21 And he asked his father, How long time is it since this has come to him? And he said, From a child.
\v 22 And oft-times it has cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you can do anything,
have compassion on us, and help us.
