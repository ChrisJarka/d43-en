\q
\v 54 A shout of distress came from Babylon, a great collapse from the land of the Chaldeans.
\q
\v 55 For Yahweh is destroying Babylon. He is causing her loud voice to perish.
\q Their enemies roar like the waves of many waters; their noise becomes very strong.
\q
\v 56 For the destroyers have come against her—against Babylon!—and her warriors have been captured.
\q Their bows are broken, for Yahweh is the God of vengeance; he will surely carry out this repayment.

  * **A shout of distress came from Babylon, a great collapse from the land of the Chaldeans** - The same thought is expressed in two different ways for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 
  * **destroying Babylon ... her loud voice** - The people of Babylon are spoken of as if they were the city itself, and the city is spoken of as if it were a woman. AT: "destroying the people of Babylon ... their loud voices" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Their enemies ... their noise** - "The enemies of the people of Babylon ... the noise of the enemies"
  * **enemies roar like the waves of many waters** - The waves of the ocean and of flooding rivers make a loud sound, and the enemies will make a very loud sound as they come. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **against her—against Babylon!—and her warriors** - The people of Babylon are spoken of as if they were the city itself, and the city is spoken of as if it were a woman. AT: "against the people of Babylon—yes, against Babylon!—and their warriors" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
