\p
\v 1 Listen before me in silence, you coastlands; let the nations renew their strength; let them come near and speak; let
us come near together for judgment.
\v 2 Who stirred up this one from the east? Who calls him in righteousness, in his service? He hands  nations over to him and
enables him to  subdue kings; he makes  them as the dust to his sword, as windblown stubble with his bow.
