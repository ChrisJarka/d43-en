====== Rhetorical Question ======

A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. An answer is not usually expected. It may be used to introduce a topic that the speaker wants to talk about, or to encourage the audience to think deeply about something they already know. At times rhetorical questions are used to express deep emotion or for sarcasm, rebuking or scolding. Some languages have other purposes as well.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Determine the purpose of the rhetorical question.
  * If your language would use a rhetorical question for that purpose, then use it.
  * Languages may have different forms of rhetorical questions for different purposes. For example, if a parent wants to scold his child for writing on the walls, some languages could do it in different ways: "Why are writing on the wall?" or "Who told you to write on the wall?" or "Is that __your__  wall that you're writing on?"
  * If your language would use a statement or a command for that purpose, then use a statement or command. For example, if your language would not say "Do you see this tree here?" in order to draw people's attention to it, you might translate that question as a command, "Look at this tree here."

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.”** Luke 1:18 (WEB)\\
When Zechariah asked this rhetorical question, he was indicating that he could not believe that what the angel said was true.

**All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of the Lord was with him.** Luke 1:66 (WEB)\\
The people were not expecting anyone to answer their question. They were simply expressing that they wondered about it because they were impressed by the surprising things they had heard about his birth.


===== Examples from English =====

**Could you do this for me?** \\
Someone could say this if they want to politely tell someone to do something.

**What possessed you to think of doing that?** \\
A mother might scold her child by saying this.
