====== cherubim ======

===== Definition: =====

Cherubim are heavenly creatures that God created. The Bible describes them as having wings and are often thought of as a special type of angel. <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>After Adam and Eve sinned, God placed cherubim with flaming swords at the east side of the Garden of Eden so that people could no longer get to the tree of life.</font>

  * God commanded the Israelites to carve two cherubim facing each other over the cover of the Ark of the Covenant, with their wings touching.
  * He also told them to weave pictures of the cherubim into the curtains of the tabernacle.
  * The cherubim seemed to be guards of sacred or holy things.
  * The singular of cherubim is cherub, but they are not babies with wings as is sometimes depicted.
  * Translation suggestions: "creatures that have wings" or "holy guardians" or "guardians with wings."
  * This term could also be written as it sounds or looks like in English or other national language.
