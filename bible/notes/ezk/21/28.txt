\v 28 So you, Son of man, prophesy and say, â€˜Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the children of Ammon concerning their disgrace, and say: A sword, a sword is drawn! It is sharpened for the slaughter, to devour! So it may be like lightning!
\v 29 While they see empty visions for you, while they divine lies for you to place you on the napes of the wicked who are slain, whose day has come and whose time of iniquity is ended.
