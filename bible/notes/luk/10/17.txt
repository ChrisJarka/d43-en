\v 19 Listen! I have given you authority so that if you oppose evil spirits they will not hurt you. I have given you authority to defeat our enemy, Satan. Nothing shawill hurt you.
\v 20 But although you can rejoice that evil spirits obey you, you should rejoice more that your names have been written  in heaven."

\v 17 And the seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name."
\v 18 And he said to them, "I was watching Satan fall from heaven as lightning.
\v 19 Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing will in any way hurt you.
\v 20 Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are engraved in heaven."
