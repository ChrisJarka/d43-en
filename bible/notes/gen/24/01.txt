===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **And Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things**  - This means the Lord gave Abraham great riches, including silver, gold, servants, sheep, cattle, camels, and donkeys. Also, God gave Abraham a son, Isaac, to inherit the family wealth.
  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **Put your hand under my thigh**  - There are a lot of questions about why this formula for an oath was used. Some ancient commentators have suggested that “thigh” was a euphemism for the genitals and that the servant's hand would be touching Abraham's genitals as a reminder of Abraham's circumcision and his covenant with God. Others rejected this idea and believed that touching the thigh was a sign of dependency. Either way, this action would show that the oath was very serious. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:euphemism|Euphemism]] )
  * **the God of heaven and the God of the earth**  - "the God of Heaven and Earth" or "the God of everything in Heaven and Earth" (See: [[en:ta:translate:merism|Merism]] )
  * **you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell**- It was important for Isaac to marry within Abraham's clan, tribe, or family to protect the family's culture and identity.
  * **go to my country and to my relatives **- "go to my relatives' country," or "go to the country of my relatives." This refers to the family that Abraham left in Haran.
  * **my relatives **- "my family"
