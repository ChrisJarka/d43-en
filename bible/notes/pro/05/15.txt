===== translationNotes: =====

  * **water from your own cistern ... running water from your own well** - These two phrases basically mean the same thing. The writer speaks of a man sleeping only with his wife as if drank water only from his own cistern or well. (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **running water** - The writer speaks of fresh or flowing water as if the water were running. AT: "fresh water" or "flowing water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Should your springs ... your streams of water flow in the public squares?** - The writer asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that his son should not do these things. AT: "Your springs should not ... your streams of water should not flow in the public squares." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Should your springs ... your streams of water flow in the public squares?** - Possible meanings are 1) a euphemism for immoral sexual behavior or 2) a metaphor for illegitimate children. AT: "So do not go out and sleep with everyone you meet, and do not fill the streets with your illegitimate children"
  * **public squares** - Open areas in a city or town where two or more streets meet. A common place for people to meet each other and talk. 
  * **Let them be** - The word "them" refers to the "springs" and "streams of water" and what they stand for.
