\v 13 It does not matter whether their parents are members of your household or slaves that have been bought; they must all be circumcised. Your bodies will have this mark to show \add you have accepted\add* this everlasting agreement I am making.
\v 14 You must expel from your community any male who has not been circumcised, because that person has disobeyed my agreement."
