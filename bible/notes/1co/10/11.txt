\v 11 Now these things happened to them by way of example and were written for us because the ends of the ages have arrived.
\v 12 Therefore let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
\v 13 There has no temptation taken you except what is common to man. But God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above that you are able to bear. But will with the temptation also make the way of escape so` that you may be able to endure it.
