\v 1 but Jesus went to the mount of Olives.
\v 2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down, and taught
them.
\v 3 And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,
\v 4 they say to him, Teacher, this woman has been taken in adultery, in the very act.
\v 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then say you of her?
\v 6 And this they said, trying him, that they might have whereof
to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
\v 7 But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him
first cast a stone at her.
\v 8 And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
\v 9 And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest,
even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.
\v 10 And Jesus lifted up himself, and said to her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?
\v 11 And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go your way; from henceforth sin no more.]

\p
\v 12 Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in the
darkness, but shall have the light of life.
\v 13 The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bear witness of yourself; your witness is not true.
\v 14 Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and
whither I go; but you know not whence I come, or whither I go.
\v 15 You judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
\v 16 Yes and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
\v 17 Yes and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.
\v 18 I am he that bears witness of myself, and the Father that sent me bears witness of me.
\v 19 They said therefore to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither me, nor my Father: if you knew me, you
would know my Father also.
\v 20 These words spoke he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.
\p
\v 21 He said therefore again to them, I go away, and you shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, you cannot
come.
\v 22 The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, you cannot come?
\v 23 And he said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world.
\v 24 I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins: for except you believe that I am
he, you shall die in your sins.
\v 25 They said therefore to him, Who are thou? Jesus said to them, Even that which I have also spoken to you from the
beginning.
\v 26 I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard
from him, these speak I to the world.
\v 27 They perceived not that he spoke to them of the Father.
\v 28 Jesus therefore said, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am
he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.
\v 29 And he that sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.
\v 30 As he spoke these things, many believed on him.
\p
\v 31 Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If you abide in my word,
then are you truly my disciples;
\v 32 and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
\v 33 They answered to him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how say thou, You shall
be made free?
\v 34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.
\v 35 And the bondservant remains not in the house for ever: the son remains for ever.
\v 36 If therefore the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.
\v 37 I know that you are Abraham’s seed, yout you seek to kill me, because my word has not free course in you.
\v 38 I speak the things which I have seen with my Father: and you also do the things which you heard from
your father.
\v 39 They answered and said to him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus says to them, If you were Abraham’s children, you would do
the works of Abraham.
\v 40 But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.
\v 41 You do the works of your father. They said to him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father,
even God.
\v 42 Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have
I come of myself, but he sent me.
\v 43 Why do you not understand my speech? Even because you cannot hear my word.
\v 44 You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the
beginning, and stands not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for
he is a liar, and the father thereof.
\v 45 But because I say the truth, you believe me not.
\v 46 Which of you convicts me of sin? If I say truth, why do you not believe me?
\v 47 He that is of God hears the words of God: for this cause you hear
them not, because you are not of God.
\v 48 The Jews answered and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?
\v 49 Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
\v 50 But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeks and judgeth.
\v 51 Verily, verily, I say to you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.
\v 52 The Jews said to him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you sayest, If a man
keep my word, he shall never taste of death.
\v 53 Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom make you thyself?
\v 54 Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom you say, that he is
your God;
\v 55 and you have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar: but I
know him, and keep his word.
\v 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
\v 57 The Jews therefore said to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?
\v 58 Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Before Abraham was born, I am.
\v 59 They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.
