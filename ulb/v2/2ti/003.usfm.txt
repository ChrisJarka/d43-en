\c 3

\v 1 But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.
\v 2 For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
\v 3 without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,
\v 4 traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
\v 5 holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof: from these also turn away.
\v 6 For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by various lusts,
\v 7 ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
\v 8 And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate
concerning the faith.
\v 9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.
\v 10 But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,
\v 11 persecutions, sufferings; what things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: and out
of them all the Lord delivered me.
\v 12 Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
\v 13 But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
\v 14 But abide you in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing of whom you have learned them;
\v 15 and that from a babe you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith
which is in Christ Jesus.
\v 16 Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
which is in righteousness:
\v 17 that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely to every good work.
