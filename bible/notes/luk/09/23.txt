\v 23 Then he said to all of them, "If any one of you wants to be my disciple, you must not do only what you yourself desire to do. Specifically, you must be willing each day  crosses to the place where they will be executed. That is what anyone who wants to be my disciple must do.
\v 24 You must do that, because those who try to save their lives by denying that they belong to me when people want to kill them for believing in me will not live eternally, but those who are killed because of being my disciples will live forever with me.
\v 25 People might get everything that they want in this world, but they are really gaining nothing if they do not get eternal life by becoming my disciples!

\v 23 And he said to all, If any man would come after follow me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
\v 24 For whoever would save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
\v 25 For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?
