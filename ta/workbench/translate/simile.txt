===== Description =====

A simile compares one thing to another thing that is different. It focuses on a particular trait the two things have in common. Unlike metaphors, similes begin with "like" or "as."

>The kingdom of heaven is __like__  a treasure hidden in a field.  (Matthew 13:44 ULB)

>Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is __like__  a man who is the owner of a house, who withdraws old and new things from his treasure.  (Matthew 13:52 ULB)


>See, I send you out __as sheep in the midst of wolves__, so be as  wise __as  serpents__ and harmless __as  doves__. (Matthew 10:16 ULB)

>Keep my commands and live and keep my instruction __as the apple of your eye.__  (Proverbs 7:2 ULB)

=== Purposes of Simile ===

  * Simile can teach about something that is unknown by showing how it is similar to something known.
  * A simile can emphasize a particular trait, sometimes in an attention-getting way.
  * Similes also help form a picture in the mind or help the reader experience what he is reading about more fully.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>Suffer hardship with me,  __as a good soldier of Christ Jesus__.  (2 Timothy 2:3 ULB)

In this simile, Paul compares suffering with what soldiers endure, and he encourages Timothy to follow the example.

>for __ as the lightning appears when it flashes from one part of the sky to another part of the sky__, so will the Son of Man be in his day.  ( Luke 17:24 ULB)\\

Jesus did not say his coming back to earth would be like lightning flashes. We can understand from the rest of the text that just as lighting flashes suddenly and everyone can see it, he will come suddenly and everyone will be able to see him. No one will have to be told about it.

==== Translation Strategies ====

If people would understand the correct meaning of a simile, consider using it. If they would not, here are some strategies you can use:

  - If one or both parts in the original simile are unknown to your people, use a simile from your own culture. Be sure that it is one that could have been used in the cultures of the Bible. We also don't want to have comparisons to things that did not exist when the books of the Bible were first written.
  - Simply state the point of similarity without using a simile. However, do not do this if the meaning was not clear to the original audience.
