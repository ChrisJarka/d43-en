\c 11
\p
\v 1 Cast your bread upon the waters; for you shall find it after many days.
\v 2 Give a portion to seven, yea, even to eight; for you know not what evil shall be upon the earth.
\v 3 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the
north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be.
\v 4 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regards the clouds shall not reap.
\v 5 As you know not what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones
do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so you know not the work of God who does all.
\v 6 In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not your hand; for you know not which shall prosper, whether
this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.
\v 7 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.
\v 8 Yea, if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be
many. All that comes is vanity.
\v 9 Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your
heart, and in the sight of your eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.
\v 10 Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
