===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **to be baptized by him**  - That is, "for John to baptize them."
    * **offspring of poisonous snakes**  - This is an insult. Certain kinds of poisonous snakes are known to eat their way out of their mothers' wombs.
    * **to flee from**  - That is, "to run away from".
    * **wrath **- This is anger that slowly builds up over a period of time, not a sudden outburst.
    * **the wrath that is coming**  - That is, "the punishment that is coming" or, "God's wrath" or, "God's punishment." The word "wrath" is being used to refer to God's punishment because his wrath precedes it. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy|Metonymy]])
