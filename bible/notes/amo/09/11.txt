\v 11 In that day I will raise up the tent of David that has fallen,
\q and close up its breaches.
\q I will raise up its ruins,
\q and rebuild it as in the days of old,

\v 12 That they may possess the remnant of Edom,
\q and all the nations that are called by my name
\q —this is Yahweh's declaration—he does this.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **In that day** - "At that time"
  * **I will raise up the tent of David that has fallen** - Causing the people of Israel to be great again is spoken of as if David's kingdom were a tent that fell down and Yahweh will set it back up. AT: "David's kingdom will be like tent that has fallen down, but I will raise it back up again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **close up its breaches** - "I will repair its walls"
  * **I will raise up its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old** - "I will rebuild its ruins and make it strong like it was long ago"
  * **breaches** - parts of a wall that have fallen down
  * **the remnant of Edom** - "the remaining part of Edom's territory"
  * **all the nations that are called by my name** - Here "name" represents Yahweh. The idiom "called by my name" means they once belonged to Yahweh. This means that in the past the people had conquered and taken control of these territories. AT: "all the nations that once belonged to me" or "all the nations that I caused the people of Israel to conquer in the past" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:02:11|2:11]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
