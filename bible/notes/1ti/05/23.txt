====== 1 Timothy 05:23-25 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 \add And Timothy\add*, no longer drink \add only\add* water, but instead, drink a little wine \add also\add*, because \add that may help to cure\add* your stomach's frequent illnesses.
\v 24 \add I tell you not\add* \add to set apart\f + \ft Or: appoint\add* \f* \add elders hastily, without seeing how they conduct their lives, because\add* some people \add sin secretly\add*, so that it is not known what they have done until after someone examines them \f + \ft Or: before God judges them \f*. But some people sin openly, so that people know what they have done before anyone examines them.
\v 25 Similarly, although \add some people\add* do good deeds openly, with the result that people know what they have done, some people \add do good deeds secretly\add*, yet the good deeds that they have done cannot remain secret either.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 No longer drink only water, Timothy. Instead, drink a little wine for your many stomach sicknesses.
\v 24 The sins of some people are clear to everyone, and the church does not need much time to judge them.  But the church does not discover some sins until later.
\v 25 In the same way, some good deeds are clear to everybody, but even the other good deeds will become clear at some time in the future.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 You should no longer drink water, but rather you should take a little wine for the stomach and your frequent sicknesses.
\v 24 The sins of some men are openly known, and they go before them into judgment. But some follow later.
\v 25 Likewise, some good works are openly known, but even the others cannot be hiddened.
