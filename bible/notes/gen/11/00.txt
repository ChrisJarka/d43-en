====== Genesis 11 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is a story traditionally referred to as the "Tower of Babel."

This chapter seeks to answer the questions: why do people speak different languages? how did people become so dispersed across the earth? God's punish may also explain why the world has racial and ethnic divisions. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Age of people when they die ==
After the flood, people began to live shorter lives. This chapter begins to record the shortening of the average lifespan.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Personification ==
The statement "Yahweh came down to see" is a type of [[:en:ta:vol2:translation:figs_personification|personification]]. Yahweh always knows what happens on earth. This statement indicates that Yahweh is about to bring [[:en:obe:kt:judge|judgment]] on mankind. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Let us build ourselves a city and a tower whose top will reach to the sky" ==
The people were very full of [[:en:obe:kt:pride|pride]] and [[:en:obe:kt:rebel|rebelled]] against God in this action. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:explicit]]).
