<usfm>
\v 15 And we are found to be false witnesses about God; because we testified against God, saying he raised up Christ, when he did not.
\v 16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.
\v 17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is in vain and you are still in your sins.
