\v 27 And these words, "Yet once more," relates to the removing of those things that are shaken, that is, things that are of this earth, so that those things which are not shaken may remain.
\v 28 Therefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us with thankfulness worship God acceptably with reverence and awe,
\v 29 for our God is a consuming fire.
