====== Biblical money ======

===== Description: =====

The following terms are some of the most well-known units of money that are used in the Bible.

  * talent (gold weight - 6,000 days' wages)
  * denarius (silver coin - one day's wages)
  * mite (copper coin - 1/64 day's wages)
  * shekel (silver weight - 4 days' wages) â€“ used as basis for measuring other money weights

How to translate Biblical units of money:

  - Use a term similar in spelling to the Bible term for that measure, followed by the equivalent value in terms of what can be earned by a days' work in Bible times or how many coins of silver or gold it represents.
  - For units of money, it is important to NOT use modern money values since these will change from year to year and will cause any Bible translation that uses them to become <font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>outdated</font>    .
