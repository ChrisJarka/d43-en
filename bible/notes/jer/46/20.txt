\q
\v 20 Egypt is a very beautiful young cow, but a sting is coming from the north! It is coming!
\q
\v 21 Also the mercenaries in her midst are like a fattened bull, yet they also will turn away and flee!
\q They will not stand together since the day of their disaster is coming against them, the time of their punishment.
\q
\v 22 A sound goes about like a snake, for they walk in the army!
\q They go with axes to her like woodcutters!
