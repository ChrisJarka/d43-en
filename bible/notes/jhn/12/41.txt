\v 41 Isaiah wrote that because \add it was as though\add* he saw \add ahead of time\add* how great Jesus would be, and he prophesied \add those things\add* about him.
\p
\v 42 Although most of the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* did not believe that Jesus is \add the Messiah\f + \ft Or: from God\add* \f*, some of them believed in him. But they would not tell anyone that they believed in him, because \add they were afraid that if they said that\add*, the Pharisees would not let them worship in the synagogues.
\v 43 They wanted people to praise them more than they wanted God to praise them.

<usfm>
\v 41 Isaiah wrote those words because he saw Christ in his work, long ago, shining brilliantly, before Jesus was born, and he wrote those wonderful descriptions of him.
\p
\v 42 Many of the leaders of the Jewish people put their trust in Jesus, yet, they greatly feared that the Pharisees would put them out of the synagogues. So they did not speak out about their faith.
\v 43 They loved the praise and power that comes from men more than the greatness and the majesty that comes from God.

\v 41 These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spoke of him.
\v 42 Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess
it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
\v 43 for they loved the glory that is of men more than the glory
that is of God.
