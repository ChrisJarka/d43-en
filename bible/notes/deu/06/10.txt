<usfm>
\v 10 Yahweh our God solemnly promised to your ancestors Abraham and Isaac and Jacob that he will give you a land that already has in it large and prosperous cities that you did not build.
\v 11 He said that the houses in those cities will already be full of many good things that \add someone else put there\add*; you did not put them there. There will be wells that someone else dug. There will be vineyards and olive trees that someone else planted. So when Yahweh brings you into that land, and you have all that you want to eat,
\v 12 be sure that you do not forget Yahweh who rescued you from being slaves \add in Egypt and gave all these things to you\add*.

\p
\v 10 And it shall be, when Jehovah your God shall bring you into the land which he sware to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee, great and goodly cities, which you buildest not,
\v 11 and houses full of all good things, which you filled not, and cisterns hewn out, which you hewedst not, vineyards and olive-trees, which you plantedst not, and you shall eat and be full;
\v 12 then beware lest you forget Jehovah, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
