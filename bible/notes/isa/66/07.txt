\v 7 Before she goes into labor, she gives birth; before her pain begins, she  delivers  a boy.
\v 8 Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Will a land be born in one day? Can a nation be brought forth
in a moment? Yet as soon as Zion goes into labor, she gives birth to her children.
