<usfm>
\q
\v 9 Regarding the prophets, my heart is broken in me, and all of my bones tremble. I have become like a drunk man,
\q like a man whom wine has overpowered, because of Yahweh and his holy words.
\q
\v 10 For the land is full of adulterers. Because of these the land is dried up.
\q The meadows in the wilderness dry up. These prophets' paths are wicked; their power is not used in a right manner.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verses 9-32 Jeremiah delivers Yahweh's message to the false prophets and the priests. Jeremiah is speaking in verse 9, but it is not clear if verse 10 are the words of Jeremiah or of Yahweh.

  * **Regarding the prophets, my heart is broken in me, and all of my bones tremble** - The prophet speaks of his heart being broken and his bones trembling because he is afraid of the judgment that will result from the lies of the false prophets. AT: "I have great fear for what will happen because of the false prophets" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **my heart is broken in me** - This idiom refers to deep sadness. AT: "I am very sad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **all of my bones tremble** - Here trembling is associated with fear. AT: "I am very afraid" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I have become like a drunk man, like a man whom wine has overpowered** - People who are drunk are not able to control themselves. Likewise, Jeremiah has lost control of himself out of fear of Yahweh's punishment. AT: "I am like a drunk man; I cannot control myself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the land is full of adulterers** - This exaggeration is used to show the level of sinfulness which was present at the time of Jeremiah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **adulterers** - This word here probably has two senses. It has the literal meaning that the men in the nation had committed adultery against their own wives, and it also has the figurative meaning that they had abandoned Yahweh in order to worship idols. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the land is dried up** - Some modern versions interpret this Hebrew phrase as "the land mourns." 
  * **These prophets' paths are wicked** - The wicked actions of the false prophets are spoken of as if they were walking on an evil path. AT: "These prophets are doing things that are wicked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
