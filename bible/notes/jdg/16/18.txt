\v 18 Delilah realized that this time he had told her the truth. So she summoned the Philistine leaders again, saying, "Come back one more time, because Samson has really told me everything \add about why he is so strong\add*". So the Philistine leaders returned and brought to Delilah the money \add that they promised to give her\add*.
\v 19 Again she lulled Samson to sleep, with his head in her lap. Then she called one of the Philistine men to come and shave off Samson's hair. As he did that, Samson began to get weaker. And finally his strength was all gone.

\v 18  When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up this once more, for he has told me all his heart.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand.
\v 19 She made him sleep in her lap; she called for a man and shaved off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to mock him, and his strength went from him.
