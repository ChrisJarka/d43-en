===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 11 God is pleased with you when other people insult you, when they do evil things to you and when other people say that you are evil because you believe in me. \v 12 When that happens, rejoice and be glad, because God will give you a great reward in heaven. God will think very well of you. It was just like that that your ancestors long ago persecuted the prophets, of whom God also thought highly.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues Jesus' teaching on the hill with his followers.

  * **against you falsely for my sake**  - "when it is not true about you but because you follow Jesus." This can also be translated as "without you doing anything to deserve it except believing in Jesus."
  * **Rejoice and be very glad**  - Jesus used words of similar meaning to call out more emotion. Not just rejoice but rejoice and be even more happy if possible. (See TAlink: doublet)
  * **great is your reward in heaven**  - "the gift or prize waiting for you in the spiritual kingdom is very large"
  * **persecuted the prophets**  - "mistreated those who spoke for God"
