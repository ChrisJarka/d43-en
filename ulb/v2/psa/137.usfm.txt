\c 137
\q
\v 1 By the rivers of Babylon,
\q There we sat down, yea, we wept,
\q When we remembered Zion.
\q
\v 2 Upon the willows in the midst thereof
\q We hanged up our harps.
\q
\v 3 For there they that led us captive required of us songs,
\q And they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying,
\q Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
\q
\v 4 How shall we sing Jehovahâ€™s song
\q In a foreign land?
\q
\v 5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,
\q Let my right hand forget her skill.
\q
\v 6 Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,
\q If I remember you not;
\q If I prefer not Jerusalem
\q Above my chief joy.
\q
\v 7 Remember, O Jehovah, against the children of Edom
\q The day of Jerusalem;
\q Who said, Rase it, rase it,
\q Even to the foundation thereof.
\q
\v 8 O daughter of Babylon, that are to be destroyed,
\q Happy shall he be, that rewardeth you
\q As you have served us.
\q
\v 9 Happy shall he be, that takes and dasheth your little ones
\q Against the rock.
