\v 11 Then you all crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho. The people of Jericho prepared to fight against you, and \add the armies of\add* the descendants of Amor, Periz, Canaan, Heth, Girgash, Hiv, and Jebus \add all prepared to do\add* the same thing, but I enabled you to defeat [IDI] them all.
\v 12 I am the one who caused them to panic as you advanced and enabled you to defeat them, as I had enabled you to do earlier to the two kings of the groups who were descendants of Amor. You did not defeat them by using your own bows and arrows and swords; \add it was I who defeated them\add*.

\v 11 You went over the Jordan and came to Jericho and the leaders of Jericho fought against you, along with the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. I delivered them into your hand.
\v 12 I sent the hornet before you, which drove the two kings of the Amorites out before you. It was not by your sword or by your bow.
