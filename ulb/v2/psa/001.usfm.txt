\c 1
\ms BOOK I
\q
\v 1 Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the wicked,
\q Nor stands in the way of sinners,
\q Nor sits in the seat of scoffers:
\q
\v 2 But his delight is in the law of Jehovah;
\q And on his law does he meditate day and night.
\q
\v 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water,
\q That brings forth its fruit in its season,
\q Whose leaf also does not wither;
\q And whatever he does shall prosper.
\q
\v 4 The wicked are not so,
\q But are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
\q
\v 5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,
\q Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
\q
\v 6 For Jehovah knows the way of the righteous;
\q But the way of the wicked shall perish.
