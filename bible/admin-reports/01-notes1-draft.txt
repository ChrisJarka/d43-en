====== Notes: Luke Draft Pages to Edit ======

~~NOCACHE~~

Luke 22 is the final chapter of Luke that the team needs to draft. The other teams will do chapters 23 and 24.

Since this is a long chapter, we assigned the first few chunks last week, but they were not completed. Please make every effort to push through this chapter by the weekend so we can close and publish this book.
