\v 27 Then \add in the vision\add* Yahweh said to me, "Tell them that this is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says: 'Drink from this cup \add some of the wine that represents the punishment that I will give you\add*. Drink a lot of it and become drunk and vomit. You will fall down and not get up again, because I will cause you to be killed in wars \f + \ft metonymy \f* that I will send to you.
\v 28 If any of those to whom you give this wine \f + \ft metonymy \f* refuse to drink it, tell them that the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says that they must drink it.
\v 29 I am starting to bring disaster to my own \f + \ft metonymy \f* city. \add Do you think that\add* you should not be punished \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? No, you will surely be punished \f + \ft litotes \f* because I am sending wars to all the nations on the earth. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, have said it.'

\v 29 I am starting to bring disaster to my own people. They will not be exempt from punishment, for I am sending wars to all the nations on the earth. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, have said it.'

\v 27 Yahweh said to me, "Now you must say to them, 'Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Drink and become drunk, then vomit, fall down, and do not rise before the sword that I am sending among you.'
\v 28 Then it will happen that if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, you will say to them, 'Yahweh of hosts says this: You must certainly drink it.
\v 29 For see, I am about to bring disaster on the city that is called by my name, and should you yourselves be free from punishment? You will not be free, for I am calling a sword against all the inhabitants of the land!â€”this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This passage continues the metaphor of Yahweh's extreme anger as wine that he causes the people of the nations to drink from a cup. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **Yahweh of hosts ... says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **before the sword that I am sending among you** - Here the word "sword" represents war. AT: "before the wars that I am causing to happen among you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the city that is called by my name** - This refers to Jerusalem and can be translated in active form. AT: "the city that I have called by my name" or "Jerusalem, which I have called by my name" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **and should you yourselves be free from punishment?** - Yahweh asks this question to rebuke the people and to emphasize that he will certainly punish them. AT: "so do not think that you yourselves will be free from punishment." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **I am calling a sword against all the inhabitants of the land** - Here the word "sword" represents war. Yahweh speaks of declaring war against the people as if he were calling a sword against them. AT: "I am declaring war against all the inhabitants of the land" or "I am bringing war against all the inhabitants of the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
