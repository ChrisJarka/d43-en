\q
\v 8 For this reason I will lament and wail;
\q I will go barefoot and naked;
\q I will wail like the jackals
\q and mourn like owls.
\q
\v 9 For her wound is incurable,
\q for it has come to Judah.
\q It has reached the gate of my people,
\q to Jerusalem.
\q
\v 10 Do not tell about it in Gath;
\q do not weep at all.
\q At Beth Leaphrah I roll myself in the dust.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Micah 1:8-16 is about God's judgment on Judah.

  * **I will lament** - Here "I" refers to Micah.
  * **I will lament and wail** - "Lament" refers to the inner feeling of sadness, and "wail" refers to the activity of making a loud, sad sound.
  * **I will go barefoot and naked** - This is a sign of extreme mourning and distress. Another possible meaning is "I will look like someone has taken off my clothes; I will be naked" 
  * **naked** - probably wearing only a loincloth
  * **like the jackals ... like owls** - Jackals and owls live in wastelands, and their loud cries sound like people wailing or weeping. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **For her wound is incurable** - Here "her" refers to the city of Samaria. This means nothing can stop the enemy army from destroying the people who live there. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for it has come to Judah** - Micah uses contagious disease as a metaphor for the army that Yahweh has sent to judge Samaria. Here "it" refers to the "wound," that is, to the army that God will use to punish Samaria. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Beth Leaphrah** - You may want to make a footnote saying, "The name of this city means 'house of dust.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **I roll myself in the dust** - People under God's judgment are expressing their grief in a strong way. AT: "I roll myself on the ground" or "I roll myself in the mud" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
