Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? -**  Isaiah uses these rhetorical questions to emphasize that the people should know how great God is. AT: "You certainly do know and have heard! It has been told to you from the beginning; even from before God created the earth!" (See: Rhetorical Question)
  * **He is the one who sits above the horizon of the earth **- "He" here is God. AT: "God rules over the entire earth." (See: Idiom)
  * **the inhabitants are like grasshoppers before him **- The people of the earth are being compared to grasshoppers. AT: "The peole of the earth below are very small in his sight." (See: Simile)
  * **He stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them out as a tent to live in **- The heavens are compared to a thin cloth made of fine material that is placed over the people as a tent to live in.
