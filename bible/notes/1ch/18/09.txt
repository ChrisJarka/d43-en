\v 9 And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the host of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
\v 10 he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and
struck him (for Hadadezer had wars with Toi); and he had with
him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
\v 11 These also did king David dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations;
from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
