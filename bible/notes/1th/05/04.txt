\v 4-5 \add Just like people\add* in darkness \add are unaware of what is happening around them, most people are not aware of what is about to happen to them\add* \f + \ft metaphor, personification \f*. Just like a thief \add comes unexpectedly for people who are unaware, that time of punishment will come on people when they are not expecting it\add* \f + \ft simile \f*. But you, my fellow believers, are people who are very much aware \f + \ft litotes \f* of what is going to happen. As a result, you will be expecting \f + \ft litotes \f* those things \f + \ft metonymy \f* to happen \f + \ft personification \f* All of us \add believers\add* are people \f + \ft idiom \f* \add who do what is right, as people usually do when it is\add* daytime \f + \ft metaphor \f*. We are not \add people who do evil things, as some people do when it is\add* dark \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 6 So we believers must be aware of what is happening. We must be watching carefully, \add as people who are awake are watchful for a thief\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. We must be self-controlled, as people who are sober\f + \ft Or: not drunk \f* are able to control what they do \f + \ft metaphor \f*. People who sleep \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add are unaware of what is happening, and unbelievers are like that\add*.
\v 7 It is at night when people \add are unaware of what is happening because they\add* are asleep, and it is at night when people become drunk \add and they do very wrong actions\f + \ft Or: things \f*\add*.

But you, my fellow believers, are people who are very much aware of what is going to happen. As a result, you will be expecting those things to happen. All of us believers are people who do what is right, as people usually do when it is daytime. We are not people who do evil things, as some people do when it is dark.
\v 6 So we believers must be aware of what is happening. We must be watching carefully, as people who are awake are watchful for a thief. We must be self-controlled, as people who are sober are able to control what they do. People who sleep are unaware of what is happening, and unbelievers are like that.
\v 7 It is at night when people are unaware of what is happening because they are asleep, and it is at night when people become drunk and they do very wrong actions.

\v 4 But you, brothers, are not in darkness that the day might overtake you as a thief,
\v 5 for you are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor or darkness,
\v 6 so then let us not sleep as the rest do, but let us keep watch and be sober.
\v 7 For those who sleep sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.
