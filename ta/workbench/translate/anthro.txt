====== Anthropomorphism ======

Anthropomorphism is when God or animals are given traits or behaviors that usually only humans have.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Anthropomorphism should not be taken literally.  The Bible is not saying that God has hands, or eyes, or ears, nor does he need to rest.  Instead, the Bible uses anthropomorphism to relate to his followers on human terms.
===== Examples from the Bible =====

Exodus 7:5 "And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when __I stretch out My hand__ on Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their midst.”

Psalm 34:15 "__The eyes of the Lord__ are toward the righteous, and __His ears__ are open to their cry."

Gen. 2:2, "And by the seventh day God completed His work which He had done; and __He rested__ on the seventh day from all His work which He had done."
