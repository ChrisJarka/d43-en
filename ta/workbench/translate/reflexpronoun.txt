====== Reflexive Pronoun ======
Reflexive pronouns refer to someone who has already been referred to in a sentence. In English they are: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, and themselves. 

===== Translation Suggestions =====

**Reflexive pronouns** have at least three functions:
  - Simply to refer to a person or object that has already been referred to in the sentence.  "I saw myself in the mirror.” ”I bought myself a new shirt.” One might be the subject (I) and the other might be an object (myself).  
  - To emphasize  a person or thing in the sentence, perhaps because it something that the listener might not expect.  I myself did it.  (Implied information:  It wasn’t someone else who did it.)  I gave it to John himself. (Implied: I didn’t give it to some other person)
  - To show that someone did something alone. "I did it by myself.” This can be translated as ”I did it alone” or ”Only I did it."

Different languages may use other ways to put emphasis on a person or thing in the sentence.
