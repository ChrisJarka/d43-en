\p
\v 1 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the
house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the passover to Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\v 2 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second
month.
\v 3 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither
had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
