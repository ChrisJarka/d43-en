====== Phase 1 Reviewer Checklist ======

Before publishing Phase 1 tN's, the reviewer should check the following:

  * Remove tN's that state information that is plainly obvious.

  * Remove tN's that are adequately clear in the UDB.

  * Correct tN's that are wrong (saying a plural is singular, for ex.).

  * Add __brief__ tN's for important topics that are not addressed in the tN's.

  * Add notes to indicate significant optional meanings for phrases, if not in the tN's.

  * Correct formatting of notes.

  * Check for correct Important Words for the ULB, and that they are linked to the right pages.
