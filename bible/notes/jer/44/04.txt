\v 4 Howbeit I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable
thing that I hate.
\v 5 But they listened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods.
\v 6 Wherefore my wrath and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of
Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.
