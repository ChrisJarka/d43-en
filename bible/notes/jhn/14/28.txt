===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **loved** - This kind of love comes from God and is focused on the good of others, even when it doesn't benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. 
  * **is greater than I** - "has greater authority than I have here"
  * **I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I** - Jesus returned to the Father after accomplishing the work of salvation. God the Father is greater than Jesus, who was experiencing humility as a human, but eternally, as persons of God, they are equal.
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
