\v 13 When Elijah heard that, he wrapped his cloak around his face. He went out of the cave and stood at its entrance. And he heard Yahweh speaking to him, saying again, "Elijah, why are you here?"
\p
\v 14 He replied again, "I have zealously served you, Yahweh, God Almighty. But the Israelite people have rejected the agreement that they made with you. They have torn down your altars, and they have killed all of your prophets. I am the only one whom they have not killed, and now they are trying to kill me, too. \add So I am running away from them\add*."

\v 13 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of
the cave. And, behold, there came a voice to him, and said, What do you here, Elijah?
\v 14 And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken your
covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life,
to take it away.
