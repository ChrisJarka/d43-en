===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For** - "Because" or "In addition to this"
  * **You will have joy and gladness** - The words "joy" and "gladness" mean the same thing and are used to emphasize how great the joy will be. AT: "you will have great joy" or "you will be very glad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **at his birth** - "because of his birth"
  * **he will be great in the sight of the Lord** - "he will be a very important person for the Lord" or "God will consider him to be very important" 
  * **he will be filled with the Holy Spirit** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Holy Spirit will empower him" or "the Holy Spirit will guide him." Make sure it does not sound similar to what an evil spirit might do to a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
