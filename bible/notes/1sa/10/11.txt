\v 11 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people
said one to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
\v 12 And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among
the prophets?
\v 13 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
