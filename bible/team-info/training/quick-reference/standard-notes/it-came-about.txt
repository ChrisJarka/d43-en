====== It came about ======

===== Definition: =====

Hebrew uses a combination of the conjunction //w// ("and") and the verb //hyh// ("to be") to signal that something new happens. This is similar to the Greek use of //egeneto// with or without the conjunction //kai//. Many languages have similar ways to introduce this change.
