\c 65
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm. A song of David.
\q
\v 1 Praise waits for thee, O God, in Zion;
\q And to you shall the vow be performed.
\q
\v 2 O you that hear prayer,
\q To you shall all flesh come.
\q
\v 3 Iniquities prevail against me:
\q As for our transgressions, you will forgive them.
\q
\v 4 Blessed is the man whom you choosest, and cause to approach
to thee,
\q That he may dwell in your courts:
\q We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house,
\q Your holy temple.
\q
\v 5 By terrible things you will answer us in righteousness,
\q Oh God of our salvation,
\q You that are the confidence of all the ends of the eareh,
\q And of them that are afar off upon the sea:
\q
\v 6 Who by his strength sets fast the mountains,
\q Being girded about with might;
\q
\v 7 Who stilleth the roaring of the seas,
\q The roaring of their waves,
\q And the tumult of the peoples.
\q
\v 8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at your tokens:
\q You make the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
\q
\v 9 You visit the earth, and waterest it,
\q You greatly enrichest it;
\q The river of God is full of water:
\q You providest them grain, when you have so prepared the earth.
\q
\v 10 You waterest its furrows abundantly;
\q You settlest the ridges thereof:
\q You make it soft with showers;
\q You blessest the springing thereof.
\q
\v 11 You crownest the year with your goodness;
\q And your paths drop fatness.
\q
\v 12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness;
\q And the hills are girded with joy.
\q
\v 13 The pastures are clothed with flocks;
\q The valleys also are covered over with grain;
\q They shout for joy, they also sing.
