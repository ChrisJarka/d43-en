\v 12 So, instead of acting as though you were spiritually tired out, trust God's discipline to renew you.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The comparison of followers of Jesus to runners of a race continues. 

    * **lift up your hands that hang down and make your weak knees strong again**  - Hanging hands and week knees represent someone who is exhausted and is not sure they can continue the race. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **make straight paths for your feet**  - One can make a straight path by removing obstacles that may hinder or injure and by eliminating distracting detours. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **whoever is lame**  - This does not refer to physically lame people, but rather to those who are spiritually weak. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **will not be led astray** - "will not be distracted from following Jesus" or "will not be spiritually deceived" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **but rather be healed** - "but instead will be spiritually strengthened so as to continue following Jesus well"  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
