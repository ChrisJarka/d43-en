\v 1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he reigned, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem, and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of LIbnah.
\v 2 And he did evin in the eyes of Yahweh, like everything that Jehoiakim had done.
\v 3 So because of the wrath of Yahweh it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah—until he sent them out from before his face—that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
