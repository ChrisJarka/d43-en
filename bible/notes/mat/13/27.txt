===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like. These verses continue the parable of the weeds.

  * **the landowner** - This is the same person who sowed good seed in his field.
  * **did you not sow good seed in your field?** - This is a rhetorical question that does not really require an answer. (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]]). The word "you" refers to the landowner.
  * **Do you wish** - "Do you want"
  * **gather them up** - "pull them up." The word "them" refers to the weeds.
