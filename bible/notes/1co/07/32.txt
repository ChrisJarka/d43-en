<usfm>
\v 32 \add Another reason why\add* I \add encourage you to remain unmarried is that\add* I desire that none of you be anxious \add about the everyday affairs of this life\add*. Unmarried men are \add able to be primarily\add* concerned about serving the Lord Jesus and trying to please him.
\v 33 But married men are \add often\add* greatly concerned about the affairs of this life. Specifically, they are concerned about pleasing their wives.
\v 34 So their thinking is divided. Unmarried women are \add able to be\add* concerned about serving the Lord. They want to set apart their minds and their bodies for the Lord. But married women are \add often\add* concerned about the affairs of this life. Specifically, they are concerned about how to please their husbands.

\v 32 In these relationships, I want you to be free from care-free. But as you see, the unmarried man is concerned about the matters the are important to the Lord. He wants to serve the Lord and do what he wants.
\v 33 But the man who is married must also be concerned for the day-to-day matters of the world as well as serving and pleasing his wife.
\v 34 Those who are married have two areas of focus in which they are seeking please: they seek to please their wives, and they seek to please the Lord. Consider unmarried women. As Christian women they are concerned to spend their time serving the Lord. Their complete loyalty to God sets themselves apart to God in mind and body. They are completely his. But married women are also concerned about the matters of the world that touch us all. And in addition to that concern, they also want to please their husbands.

<usfm>
\v 32 I would want you to be free from worries. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. 
\v 33 But the married man is concerned for the things of the world, and how to please his wife;
\v 34 his interests are divided. So also the unmarried or the virgin is concerned for the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and in spirit. But the married woman is also concerned about the things of the world and how to please her husband.
