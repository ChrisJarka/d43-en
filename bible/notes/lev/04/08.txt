\v 8 From that offering the Supreme Priest must separate these things from the bull that is to be burned: The fat that covers the inner parts of the bull or which is attached to them—
\v 9 the kidneys and the fat that is attached to them near the lower back muscle, and the fat that covers the liver.
\v 10 Then the Supreme Priest must completely burn those things on the altar. That will be just like when the fat is removed from an animal that is sacrificed to maintain good fellowship \add with Yahweh\add*.

\v 8 All the fat of the bull of the sin offering he will cut away from it: the fat that covers the inner parts, and all the fat that is attached to the inner parts,
\v 9 and the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the lobe of the liver, with the kidneys, he will cut away,
\v 10 as it is cut off from the bull of the sacrifice of peace offerings. Then the priest will burn them upon the altar of burnt offering.
