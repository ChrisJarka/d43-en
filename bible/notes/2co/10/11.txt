\v 11 The \add people who say\add* such things should think carefully about this: The kind of \add severe\add* person that \add you think\add* me to be when you read my letters is exactly the kind of person I will be when I come. \add I will do what I wrote that I would do\add*.
\p
\v 12 \add Those who oppose me\add* tell others how good they are. \add If they really were superior to me\add* \f + \ft irony \f*, I would not be so bold as to say that I \add was equal to them, or\add* to compare myself with them\add . But they are not superior to me\add*. They make up their own standards \add about what God's servants should be like\add*, and then they look at their own \add conduct\add* and decide \add whether or not they meet those standards. By doing that, they show that\add* they are foolish.

\v 11 Let such a person consider that, what we say by letter when we are absent is the same as what we will do when we are present.
\v 12 For we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves, but  when they  measure themselves by each other, 
and compare themselves with each other, they are ignorant.
