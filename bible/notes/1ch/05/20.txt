\v 20 And they were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them; for they
cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them, because they put their trust in him.
\v 21 And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of
asses two thousand, and of men a hundred thousand.
\v 22 For there fell many slain, because the war was of God. And they lived in their stead until the captivity.
