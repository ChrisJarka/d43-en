\v 14 You will be very happy, and many other people will also be happy because he is born.
\v 15 God will consider him to be very important. He must never drink wine or any other alcoholic drink. He will be empowered by the Holy Spirit even before he is born.
\v 16 He will persuade many descendants of Israel to stop sinning and start obeying the Lord their God again.
\v 17 Your son will go in advance of the Lord as his forerunner and will be powerful in his spirit like the prophet Elijah was. He will cause parents to love their children again. He will cause many people who do not obey God to live wisely and to obey him as righteous people do. He will do this in order to cause many people to be ready when the Lord comes."

\v 14 You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.  
\v 15 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He will drink no wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb. 
\v 16 And many of the people of Israel will be turned to the Lord their God.  
\v 17 He will go before the face of the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah. He will do this to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, so that the disobedient will walk in the wisdom of the just. He will do this to make ready for the Lord a people who have been prepared for him.‚Äù

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The angel continues to speak to Zechariah. 

  * **For** - "Because" or "In addition to this"
  * **he will be great in the sight of the Lord** - AT:  "he will do very important things for the Lord"
  * **He will be filled with the Holy Spirit** - "The Holy Spirit will empower him" or "The Holy Spirit will guide him" Make sure it does not sound similar to what an evil spirit might do to a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **even while in his mother's womb** - The word "even" here indicates that this is especially surprising news. People had been filled with the Holy Spirit before, but no one had heard of an unborn baby's being filled with the Holy Spirit.
