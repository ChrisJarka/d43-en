===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God continues to speak in 75:4-5. The writer begins speaking in 75:6.

  * **and to the wicked** - "and I said to the wicked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **Do not be confident ... Do not be so sure** - It would be better to use the same words two times than to make these two lines one. "Do not be confident" is parallel to "Do not be arrogant," and "Do not be so sure" is parallel to "do not speak."
  * **of victory** - "that you will be able to do what you say you will do" or "that you will win the battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]))
  * **with your head held so high** - "arrogantly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Victory does not come** - The psalmist speaks of the ability to do what one says one will do or to win battles as if it were a person who could travel. AT: "No one will come to help you do what you say you will do" or "No one will come to help you win the battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
