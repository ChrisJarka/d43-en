\v 3 Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil. He still holds fast to his integrity, although you persuaded me to act against him, to destroy him without cause.”

  * **Have you considered my servant Job?** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:job:01:06|01:8]]. God is continuing to challenge Satan's accusation and does not expect an answer from Satan. He wants to talk about Job to Satan. Alternate translation: “Consider my servant Job.”  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
  * **a perfect and an upright man** - The words "perfect" and "upright" are used together to show that Job was perfect by the laws of God and the laws of men. See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:job:01:06|01:8]]. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **one who fears God and turns away from evil** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:job:01:06|01:8]].
  * **still holds fast to his integrity** - "still does what is good and right"
  * **persuaded me to act against him** - God is saying that Satan stirred up this event. God is still in control over everything. Alternate translation: "urged me to attack him"
