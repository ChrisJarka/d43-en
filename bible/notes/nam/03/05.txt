\v 5 Behold, I am against thee, says Jehovah of hosts, and I will uncover your skirts upon your face; and I will show the
nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame.
\v 6 And I will cast abominable filth upon you, and make you vile, and will set you as a gazing-stock.
\v 7 And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon you shall flee from you, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who
will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
