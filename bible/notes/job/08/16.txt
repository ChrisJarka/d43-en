<usfm>
\v 16 Godless people \add are like plants\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* that are watered before the sun rises;
\q2 their shoots spread all over the gardens.

\v 17 The roots of those plants twist around the piles of stones
\q2 and cling tightly to the rocks.
\q1
\v 18 But if those plants are pulled out,
\q2 \add it is as though\add* the place where they were planted says 'They were never here!'
\q2 \add And that is what happens to wicked people who do not heed what God says\add*.

\v 16 He is green before the sun,
\q And his shoots go forth over his garden.
\q
\v 17 His roots are wrapped about the stone-heap,
\q He sees the place of stones.

\v 18 If he be destroyed from his place,
\q Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
