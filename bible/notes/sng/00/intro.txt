=== What is the Song of Solomon about? ===

The Song of Solomon is a poem or a series of poems about the love between a man and a woman. It became traditional for Jews to interpret the book as a picture of God's love for the people of Israel. In the same way, it became traditional for Christians to interpret it as a picture of Christ's love for all Christian believers.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Song of Solomon" may also be called the "Songs of Love," "Great poems of love" or "The love songs of Solomon."

=== Who wrote The Song of Solomon? ===

Although there are different ways of understanding the opening verse of the book, it is likely that Solomon is the author of Song of Solomon.

=== Is The Song of Solomon about a man's love for his wife or something else? ===

The book is a song of love and adoration, but a few hundred years ago the Song of Songs was read as a song of love of the redeemer for his church. Most believe that the Song of Solomon is a literal account of marriage and marital love. There are other suggestions, but the conclusion may be that the Song of Solomon is an expression of human love. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== How does The Song of Solomon view human sexuality? ===

In the Ancient Near East, there was a great amount of sexual perversion. The book views human sexuality as a gift from God to be exercised within the bounds of marriage. Sex is not dirty, sinful or unclean, rather is intended as an expression of love between a husband and wife. Rather than give a proscriptive set of rules governing human sexuality, the Song of Solomon gives a description of godly sexuality within the confines of marriage.

=== Does this book have religious significance? ===

Song of Solomon does not mention God and it is likely about a physical relationship between a husband and a wife, but this does not mean it is without religious significance. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How many characters are in The Song of Solomon? ===

One problem translators face is the question of whether there are two characters (Solomon and the Shulamite bride) or is there a third character, the shepherd boy. If so, there would be a conflict between the love of the Shulamite for the shepherd boy and the love which Solomon has for the Shulamite. The difficulty in resolving this question (two characters or three?) is that the characters are not clearly separated or identified in the text. The three-character reading is difficult because there is no specific person named, except by inference, as the third character.

The language of love and the celebration of those who attend the wedding and the preparation is beautiful. They exchange words of love between the couple, interrupted only by the “daughters of Jerusalem” singing songs, join in with the celebration and glory of human love. The couple has troubles (see: 5:2-6:2), but they affirmed their love for one another in spite of the difficulties (see: 8:5-14).

=== How do I translate The Song of Solomon if my culture views certain terms as course, vulgar or improper? ===

There are many images or forms appearing in the Song of Solomon that, when translated, may be considered improper. Try to avoid offensive language if possible. It is possible to change wording or figures used so as to not offend people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
