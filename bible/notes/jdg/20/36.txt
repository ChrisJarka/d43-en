\v 36-38 The main group of Israelite men arranged with the men who would be hiding that they should send up a smoke signal to enable the main group of soldiers to know when they should attack. Then the main group of Israelite men retreated for a short distance, because they knew that the other Israelite men \add who had been hiding on the other side\add* of Gibeah would attack the people of the tribe of Benjamin by surprise. So \add after the main group of Israelite men retreated a little distance\add*, the men who had been hiding rushed out and ran into Gibeah and used their swords to kill everyone in the city. \add Then they started to burn the buildings\add*.

\v 36-38 This is how it happened: The main group of Israelite men arranged with the men who would be hiding that they should set part of the city on fire, in order to send a thick plume of smoke into the air. This smoke would signal the main group of soldiers to attack. Then the main group of Israelite men retreated for a short distance, because they trusted that the other Israelite men who had been hiding on the other side of Gibeah would attack the people of the tribe of Benjamin by surprise. So after the main group of Israelite men retreated a little distance, the men who had been hiding rushed out and ran into Gibeah and used their swords to kill everyone in the city. Then they started to burn the buildings.

\v 36 So the soldiers of Benjamin saw they were defeated. The men of Israel had given ground to Benjamin, because they were counting on the men they had placed in hidden positions outside Gibeah.
\v 37 Then the men who were hiding got up and hurried and they rushed into Gibeah, and with their swords they killed everyone who lived in the city.
\v 38 Now the arranged signal between the soldiers of Israel and the men hiding in secret would be that a great cloud of smoke would rise up out of the cityâ€”
