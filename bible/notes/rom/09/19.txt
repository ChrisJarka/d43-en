\v 19 One of you may object to this by saying to me, "Because God determines ahead of time everything that people do, that also implies that he wants us to do everything that we do. No one has resisted what God has willed! Therefore, it would not be right that God would still condemn a person for having sinned!"
\v 20 I would reply that since you (sg) are just a human being, you do not have any right at all to criticize God! As a potter is the one who creates a clay pot, God is the one who created you. A clay pot certainly would not have a right to criticize the potter by asking, “Why did you(sg) make me this way?”
\v 21 Instead, the potter certainly has the right to take some clay and from one lump of clay make one pot that people will honor and make another one for ordinary purposes. Similarly, God has the right to carry out what he purposes for people.

\v 19 You will say then to me, Why does he still find fault? For who has withstood his will?
\v 20 On the contrary, O man, who are you who answers against God? Will that which is molded say to the one who molds, "Why did you make me this way?"
\v 21 Or has not the potter authority over the clay to make from the same lump one part a vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?
