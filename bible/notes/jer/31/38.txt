\v 38 Behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah from the tower of Hananel to the gate of
the corner.
\v 39 And the measuring line shall go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and shall turn about to Goah.
\v 40 And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of
the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy to Jehovah; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.
