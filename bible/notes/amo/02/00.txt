====== Amos 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter consists of oracles against Moab and Judah by using poetic language and imagery. 


== Judah ==

In contrast, Moab is only given two verses whereas Judah is written about for the rest of the chapter. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

You will notice that the phrase ""For three sins of Judah, even for four," is used to begin one of these oracles. This is not a literal count but more showing a large number of sins.
