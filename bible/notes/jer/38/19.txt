===== translationNotes: =====

  * **deserted** - escaped trouble and left people who needed help. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:37:11|37:13]].
  * **I might be given over into their hand** - The word "hand" is a metonym for the power or control that the hand exercises. This can be translated in active form. AT: "the Chaldeans may put me under the control of the people of Judah who have deserted" or "the Chaldeans may allow the people of Judah who have deserted to do whatever they want with me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for them to treat me badly** - Here the word "them" refers to the people of Judah who have deserted.
