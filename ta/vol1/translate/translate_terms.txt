== These are terms that the Translation Manual will use to talk about language. The translator will need to understand these terms in order to use the Translation Manual. ==

**Text** - A text is something that a speaker or writer is communicating to a hearer or reader by means of language. The speaker or writer has a certain meaning in mind, and so he or she chooses a form of the language to express that meaning.

**Form** - The structure of the language as it appears on the page or as it is spoken. "Form" refers to the way that the language is arranged - it includes the words, the word order, the grammar, idioms, and any other features of the structure of the text.

**Meaning** - The underlying idea or concept that the text is trying to communicate to the reader or hearer. A speaker or writer can communicate the same meaning by using different forms of the language, and different people can understand different meanings from hearing or reading the same language form. In this way you can see that form and meaning are not the same thing.

**Translation** - The act of expressing the meaning conveyed by the form of one language in the form of another language.

**Source Language** - The language //from// which the translation is being made.

**Source Text**- The text //from// which the translation is being made.

**Target Language** - The language //into// which a translation is being made.

**Target Text**- The text being made by the translator as he or she translates the meaning from the source text.

**Original Language** - The language in which a Bible text was initially written. The Original Language of the New Testament is Greek. The Original Language of most of the Old Testament is Hebrew. However, the Original Language of some parts of Daniel and Ezra is Aramaic. The Original Language is always the most accurate language from which to translate a passage.

**Language of Wider Communication** - A language that is spoken over a broad area and by many people. For most people, this is not their first language, but is the language that they use to speak to people outside of their language community. Some people call this a trade language. Most Bibles will be translated using a language of wider communication as the source language.

**Literal Translation** - A translation that focuses on reproducing the form of the source text in the target text, even if the meaning changes as a result.

**Meaning-based Translation (or Dynamic Translation)** - A translation that focuses on reproducing the meaning of the source text in the target text, even if the form changes as a result.

**Passage** - A section of the Bible text that is being talked about. This can be as small as one verse, but it is usually several verses that together have one topic or tell one story.
