\c 17
\q
\v 1 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith,
\q Than a house full of feasting with strife.
\q
\v 2 A servant that deals wisely shall have rule over a son that causes shame,
\q And shall have part in the inheritance among the brethren.
\q
\v 3 The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold;
\q But Jehovah tries the hearts.
\q
\v 4 An evil-doer gives heed to wicked lips;
\q And a liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.
\q
\v 5 Whoso mocketh the poor reproaches his Maker;
\q And he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.
\q
\v 6 Childrenâ€™s children are the crown of old men;
\q And the glory of children are their fathers.
\q
\v 7 Excellent speech becomes not a fool;
\q Much less do lying lips a prince.
\q
\v 8 A bribe is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that has it;
\q Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
\q
\v 9 He that covers a transgression seeks love;
\q But he that harpeth on a matter separateth chief friends.
\q
\v 10 A rebuke enters deeper into one that has understanding
\q Than a hundred stripes into a fool.
\q
\v 11 An evil man seeks only rebellion;
\q Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
\q
\v 12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
\q Rather than a fool in his folly.
\q
\v 13 Whoso rewardeth evil for good,
\q Evil shall not depart from his house.
\q
\v 14 The beginning of strife is as when one lets out water:
\q Therefore leave off contention, before there is quarrelling.
\q
\v 15 He that justifies the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous,
\q Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah.
\q
\v 16 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,
\q Seeing he has no understanding?
\q
\v 17 A friend loves at all times;
\q And a brother is born for adversity.
\q
\v 18 A man void of understanding striketh hands,
\q And becomes surety in the presence of his neighbor.
\q
\v 19 He loves transgression that loves strife:
\q He that raises high his gate seeks destruction.
\q
\v 20 He that has a wayward heart finds no good;
\q And he that has a perverse tongue falls into mischief.
\q
\v 21 He that begetteth a fool does it to his sorrow;
\q And the father of a fool has no joy.
\q
\v 22 A cheerful heart is a good medicine;
\q But a broken spirit dries up the bones.
\q
\v 23 A wicked man receiveth a bribe out of the bosom,
\q To pervert the ways of justice.
\q
\v 24 Wisdom is before the face of him that has understanding;
\q But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.
\q
\v 25 A foolish son is a grief to his father,
\q And bitterness to her that bare him.
\q
\v 26 Also to punish the righteous is not good,
\q Nor to strike the noble for their uprightness.
\q
\v 27 He that spareth his words has knowledge;
\q And he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding.
\q
\v 28 Even a fool, when he holds his peace, is counted wise;
\q When he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent.
