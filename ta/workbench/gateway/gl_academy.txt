The translationAcademy contains many lessons on very specialized and technical topics, such as language, translation issues, biblical studies, and computer and audio software and equipment. Some of the vocabulary is also very specialized. We recommend that the people who translate the translationAcademy into a Gateway Language have a college-level education or some training and experience in the particular area that they are translating. For example, if you are translating the translation manual, it would be good if you have training and experience in linguistics and translation. If you are translating the audio manual, it would be good if you have training and experience using audio equipment. In that way, you will understand what you are translating and can make a translation that will be much clearer and easier for the Other Language translator to use. 

This will mean that you will want to have several specialists on your translation team, with each one choosing to translate the parts of the translationAcademy that they are most familiar with. If you find that some lessons are unclear, discuss the problem with other members of the translation team until you understand what the lesson is trying to teach. You cannot translate something that you do not understand. If you try to do that, the Other Language translator will not be able to understand it or use it. 

We also recommend that you use specialized dictionaries as you translate. This will only be for your own reference, however, to make sure that you understand the concepts that you are translating. Do not use these dictionaries in order to find unusual or technical words that you can use. Please do not use unusual or technical words if there is a simpler way to communicate something. Remember that the OL translator speaks the Gateway Language as a second language. He will not know the unusual or technical words. So please try to keep the lessons uncomplicated and clear, using simple language as much as you possibly can. We have tried to write the lessons of translationAcademy using simple language, so please follow this same style.
