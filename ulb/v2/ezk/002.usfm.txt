\c 2
\p
\v 1 And he said to me, Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak with thee.
\v 2 And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spoke to me.
\v 3 And he said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have
rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.
\v 4 And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do send you to them; and you shall say to them, Thus says the
Lord Jehovah.
\v 5 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that
there has been a prophet among them.
\v 6 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and
you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, yough they are a rebellious
house.
\v 7 And you shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most
rebellious.
\p
\v 8 But you, son of man, hear what I say to thee; be not you rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and
eat that which I give thee.
\v 9 And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;
\v 10 And he spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and
mourning, and woe.
