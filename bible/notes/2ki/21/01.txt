\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s
name was Hephzibah.
\v 2 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, like the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.
\v 3 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed, and he built altars for Baal and made an
Asherah pole, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the stars of heaven  and served them.
