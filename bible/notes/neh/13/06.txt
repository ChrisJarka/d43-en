\v 6 But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirties year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I
went to the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,
\v 7 and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the
courts of the house of God.
