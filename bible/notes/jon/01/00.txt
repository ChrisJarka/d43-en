====== Jonah 01 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

This narrative starts abruptly. This could cause difficulty for the translator. It would be helpful to read the Introduction to Jonah. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Miracle ==

In verse [[:en:bible:notes:jon:01:17|17]], there is the mention of "a great fish". It is hard to imagine a sea creature big enough to swallow a man whole who then survives for three days and nights inside. Translators should not try to explain miraculous events in an attempt to make it easier to understand. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Irony ==
There is [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony|irony]] expressed in this chapter. Jonah is a prophet of God and should endeavor to do God's will. Instead he is running away from God. Whereas the Gentile sailors are not Israelites but they act out of faith and fear of Yahweh when sending Jonah to a "certain death" by throwing him overboard. 

People in the ancient Near East also saw the sea as chaotic and did not trust it. Some of the [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]] they worshipped were gods of the sea. Jonah's people, the Hebrews, feared the sea greatly. However, Jonah's fear of Yahweh was not enough to keep him from going into a ship and sailing to get away from Yahweh. His actions are contrasted by the actions of the Gentiles.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Implicit knowledge ==

Even though scholars are not sure of where Tarshish is, we can be sure it in exact opposite way of where God told Jonah to go. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
