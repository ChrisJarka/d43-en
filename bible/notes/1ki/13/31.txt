\v 31 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the
sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
\v 32 For the saying which he cried by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high
places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
