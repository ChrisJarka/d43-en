\v 43 And right away, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came and with him a great crowd with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
\v 44 Now the one who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "Whoever I kiss, he is the one; seize him, and lead him away safely."
\v 45 When he arrived, immediately he came to him, and said, "Rabbi, Rabbi" and kissed him.
