\v 33 "Think about this: You can know whether \add a person is good and what that person says is good, in the same way that you\add* can know whether a tree \f + \ft metaphor \f* and the fruit it produces \f + \ft metaphor \f* are good. \add You can also know whether a person and what that person says is evil in the same way that you can know\add* whether a tree \f + \ft metaphor \f* and its fruit \f + \ft metaphor \f* are blighted. You can know whether a tree is good by \add seeing\add* its fruit, and similarly \add people can know the evil character of you Pharisees by listening to your accusations against me\add*.
\v 34 \add What\add* you \add teach harms people spiritually like poisonous\add* snakes \add harm them physically\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! You are not able to speak good things because you are evil \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. Evil people \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add like you\add* speak what comes from all that is in their inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*.
\v 35 Good people \add speak good things. That is like\add* taking good things out of buildings where they are stored. But evil people \add speak evil things. That is like\add* taking evil things out of buildings where they are stored.

\v 33 "Think about this: You can know whether a person is good and what that person says is good, in the same way that you can know whether a tree and the fruit it produces are good. You can also know whether a person and what that person says is evil in the same way that you can know whether a tree and its fruit are blighted. You can know whether a tree is good by seeing its fruit, and similarly people can know the evil character of you Pharisees by listening to your accusations against me.
\v 34 What you teach harms people spiritually like poisonous snakes harm them physically! You are not able to speak good things because you are evil. Evil
people like you speak what comes from all that is in their inner beings.
\v 35 Good people speak good things. That is like taking good things out of buildings where they are stored. But evil people speak evil things. That is like taking evil things out of buildings where they are stored.

\v 33 Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by
its fruit.
\v 34 You offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
speaketh.
\v 35 The good man out of his good treasure brings forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings
forth evil things.
