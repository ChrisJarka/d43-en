===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The author continues the use of metaphors to express how the Lord opposed Judah.

  * **he has cut off every horn of Israel** - This speaks of the Lord taking away Israel's strength as if he were cutting off its horns. The word "horn" refers to an animal horn, not a musical instrument. AT: "he has taken away all of Israel's strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **withdrawn his right hand from before the enemy** - Here the Lord's protection is represented by his "right hand." AT: "stopped protecting us from our enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He has burned up Jacob like a blazing fire that devours everything around it** - This speaks of how the Lord has destroyed Jacob as if a fire has completely burned it. AT: "He has destroyed Jacob like a blazing fire destroys everything" 
  * **Jacob** - Here "Jacob" refers to the places where his descendants lived. AT: "Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Like an enemy he has bent his bow toward us, with his right is ready to shoot** - This speaks of the Lord preparing to attack Israel as if he were an enemy about to shoot them with a bow and arrow. A soldier has to bend his bow in order to shoot it. AT: "He has prepared to kill us, like an enemy who has made his bow ready to shoot us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **in the tent of the daughter of Zion** - The "daughter of Zion" is a poetic name for Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. The phrase "tent of the daughter of Zion" speaks of Jerusalem as a "tent" emphasizing that it is the home of those who live there. AT: "who live in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he has poured out his wrath like fire** - This speaks of the Lord's wrath as if it were a liquid that he were pouring out on the people. His wrath is also compared to a "fire" to emphasize how destructive it is. AT: "in his anger he has destroyed everything like a blazing fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
