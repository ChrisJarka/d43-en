\v 5 My heart cries out for Moab; her fugitives flee to Zoar and to Eglath-shelishi-yah. They go up  the ascent of Luhith
 weeping; on the road to Horonaim they loudly lament their destruction.
\v 6 The waters of Nimrim are dried up;  the grass is withered away and the new grass dies, nothing is green.
\v 7 The abundance they have grown and stored they carry away over the brook of the willows.
