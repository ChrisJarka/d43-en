===== translationNotes: =====

  * **it will be said** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will say"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **burning wind from the plains ... wind far stronger** - Here a "burning wind" represents a fierce and merciless enemy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **will make its way** - "will travel" or "will rush"
  * **the daughter of my people** - Yahweh shows his love for his people by speaking of them as a daughter. AT: "my people, who are like a daughter to me" or "my dear people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **It will not winnow or cleanse them** - The words "winnow" and "cleanse" refer to blowing away the useless skins from grain. Only a light wind was needed for that. AT: "It will not be a light wind for blowing the chaff away from the grain" (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **will come at my command** - "will come when I command it to come"
  * **at my command** - This expression in Hebrew is interpreted by some modern versions as "for me" or "from me."
