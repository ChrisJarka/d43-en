====== threshing floor, threshing-floor ======


===== Definition: =====


A threshing floor is a special place for separating food grain from unwanted materials


    * Ancient threshing floors were made of cobble stones which made it easy to sweep up grain.
    * The process of threshing was performed on the threshing floor by tossing the grain into the air. Lighter unwanted materials called chaff would blow away leaving the heavier grains to fall on the floor where it was swept into piles.
