===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 I am \add like\add* a good shepherd. A good shepherd \add is willing to\add* die to save the sheep \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, I am ready to sacrifice myself to save those who belong to me\add*.
\v 12 A worker whom someone has hired \add to look after the sheep\add* is not \add like\add* the shepherd or the one who owns the sheep. So when he sees a wolf coming, he leaves the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock of sheep and \add seizes one sheep and\add* causes\add the others\add* to scatter.
\v 13 The worker runs away because he is \add only\add* a man whom someone has hired. He is not \add really\add* concerned about \add what happens to\add* the sheep \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, your religious teachers do not really care what happens to you\add*.

<usfm>
\v 11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life to protect and to save his sheep.
\v 12 The hired man is paid money to watch over the sheep. He doesn't treat the sheep like they belong to him, he is just an employee doing a job.  So when he sees a wolf coming to kill the sheep, he doesn't risk his life or put himself in danger. He leaves the sheep and runs away, making it possible for the wolf to attack the sheep, seizing some of them and scattering others.
\v 13 The hired worker runs away because he is only working for the money. He does not care about what happens to the sheep.

\v 11 I am the good shepherd.  The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
\v 12 He that is a hired servant, and not a shepherd, who does not  own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and abandons the sheep,and escapes.  and the wolf carries  them off, and scatters them:
\v 13 he runs away because he is a hired servant, and does not care for the sheep.
