======  Matthew 27 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Delivered him to Pilate the governor" ==
Since the Jews were under the rule of the Roman Empire, there were not able to sentence a criminal to death. Therefore, the Jewish leaders had to beg the Roman leaders to sentence Jesus to death. The Roman leaders tried to avoid this by making the Jews choose between freeing Jesus or a very bad prisoner named Barabbas. 

== Tomb ==
Do you want to say something about how this was a common practice for burial in the ancient Near East?


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "Hail, King of the Jews!" ==
This is sarcasm, which is the use of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]] to insult someone. This chapter uses the phrase "this is Jesus the king of the Jews" in the same way.
