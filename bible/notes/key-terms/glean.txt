  * God told the Israelites to let the widows, other poor people and foreigners glean the leftover grain in order to provide food for themselves on a daily basis.
  * Sometimes the owner of the field would allow the gleaners to go right behind the harvesters to glean, which would give them much more grain.
  * A clear example of how this worked is in the story of Ruth, who was generously allowed to glean among the harvesters in the fields of her relative Boaz.
  * Other ways to translate "glean" can be, "pick up" or "gather" or "collect",
