A symbolic action is something that someone does in order to express a certain idea. An action does not have to actually be performed; it may simply be referred to.  


**Examples of symbolic actions**\\ 
  * In some cultures people shake hands when they meet to show that they are willing to be friendly. \\ 
  * In some cultures people bow when they  meet to show respect to each other. 

**Reason symbolic actions may be an issue in Bible translation** \\ 
An action may have a meaning in one culture, and a different meaning or no meaning at all in another culture.  For example, in some cultures raising the eyebrows means "I am surprised" or "What did you say?" In others cultures it means "Yes."  

In the Bible people did things that had certain meanings in their culture. When we read the Bible we might misunderstand what someone meant if we interpret the action based on what it means in our own culture. 


===== Examples of Symbolic Actions in the Bible=====

**Jairus fell down at Jesus' feet.**  (Luke 8:41) \\ 
Meaning of symbolic action: He did this to show great respect to Jesus. 

**Look, I stand at the door and __knock__. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to his home, and have a meal with him, and he with me.** (Revelation 3:20) \\ 
Meaning of symbolic action: When people want someone to welcome them into their home, they stand at the door and knock on it. 

===== Translation Strategies if people would not understand the symbolic action =====

    - Tell what the person did and why he did it.  
    - Do not tell what the person did, but tell what he meant. 
    - Use an action from your own culture that has the same meaning. Do this only in poetry, parables, and sermons. Do not do this when there actually was a person who did a specific action.

1. Tell what the person did and why he did it. \\  
**Jairus fell down at Jesus feet** (Luke 8:41) \\ 
"Jairus fell down at Jesus' feet in order to show that he greatly respected him." \\ 
2. Do not tell what the person did, but tell what he meant. \\ 
"Jairus showed Jesus great respect."  \\ 
3.  Use an action from your own culture that has the same meaning. Since Jairus actually did this, we would not substitute an action from our own culture. 



 
**Look, I stand at the door and knock.** (Revelation 3:20)  \\ 
1. Tell what the person did and why he did it. \\ 
"Look, I stand at the door and knock on it, asking you to let me in." \\ 
2. Do not tell what the person did, but tell what he meant. 
"Look, I stand at the door and ask you to let me in." \\ 
3. Use an action from your own culture that has the same meaning. Jesus was not standing at a real door. Rather he was speaking figuratively about wanting to have  a relationship with people. So in cultures where it is polite to clear one's throat when wanting to be let into a house, you could substitute clearing the throat for knocking on the door. \\ 
"Look, I stand at the door and clear my throat." \\
