====== Personification [pərˌsänəfiˈkāSHən] ======

Personification is a kind of simile or metaphor, in which an idea or something that is not alive is referred to as if it were a person and could do the things people do or have the attributes people have.


===== Purposes of Personification =====


===== Examples from English =====

**That delicious looking dessert is calling out to me "Eat me. Eat me."**
 
**The raging fire devoured everything in it's way.**

**Time waits for no one.**


===== Examples from the Bible =====


**Wisdom is justified by all her children.** Luke 7:35 (WEB)\\ 
Here Jesus spoke of wisdom as if it were a woman that has children. Wisdom's "children" are people who believe and follow wisdom. As a result of following God's wisdom they live wisely, and their wise behavior proves that God's wisdom is right. 

**Therefore also __the wisdom of God said__, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,** Luke 11:49 (WEB)\\
Here God's wisdom is personified as if it could speak.

**But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. __Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed__. Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.** Luke 23:23b, 24 (WEB)\\ 
In this personification, the people's voices and Pilate's voice are portrayed as if they are in a battle, and the people's shouting voices win the battle. Pilate would do what they wanted.

**But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, __that the day should overtake you like a thief__. You are all sons of light, and sons of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness,** 1 Thessalonians 5:4, 5, (WEB)\\ 
A thief can overtake a person when that person is unaware and is not expecting him. In the same way, "that day" (the time of punishment) can happen at a time when people are unaware and not expecting it. Paul reminds the people that since they __are__ aware, this will not happen to them.


===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * If the personification would be understood correctly, use it.
  * Using the words "like" or "as" can help clarify that this is a figure of speech, as in 1 Thessalonians 5:4, "that the day should overtake you __like__ a thief"
  * If it wouldn't be understood correctly, find a way to translate it without the personification. For example, "The wisdom of God said" could be translating as "God in his wisdom said."
