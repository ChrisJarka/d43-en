  * **This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah** - The phrase "the word of Yahweh came" is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:14:01|14:1]].

  * **the fourth year** - The word "fourth" is the ordinal form of "four." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
