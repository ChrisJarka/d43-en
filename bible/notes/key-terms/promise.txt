====== promise, oath ======

===== Definition: =====

A promise is a pledge or commitment to do a certain thing. When someone makes a promise, he assures the people he is speaking to that he will truly do what he has said he will do.

  * Promises are an important part of formal agreements such as covenants.
  * A promise is often accompanied by an oath or a confirmation that it will be done.
  * An oath is a strong promise or a strong declaration that what one says is true. Sometimes when people take an oath, they show that what they have said is true by asking God to do them harm if it is not true.
