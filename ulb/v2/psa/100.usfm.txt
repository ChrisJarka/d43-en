\c 100
\d A Psalm of thanksgiving.
\q
\v 1 Make a joyful noise to Jehovah, all you lands.
\q
\v 2 Serve Jehovah with gladness:
\q Come before his presence with singing.
\q
\v 3 Know you that Jehovah, he is God:
\q It is he that has made us, and we are his;
\q We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
\q
\v 4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,
\q And into his courts with praise:
\q Give thanks to him, and bless his name.
\q
\v 5 For Jehovah is good; his lovingkindness endures for ever,
\q And his faithfulness to all generations.
