===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:en:bible:notes:key-terms:godthefather|Father]]

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **When they saw him**  - That is, "When Mary and Joseph found Jesus."
    * **astonished**  - That is, "amazed" or, "shockingly surprised."
    * **Why have you treated us this way?**  - That is, "How could you do this?" This was somewhat of an indirect rebuke because he had not gone with them on the way back home. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
    * **Why were you searching for me?**  - That is, "Why did you two keep looking for me in other places?"
    * **Did you not know…?** - This starts a rhetorical question. Jesus was not trying to find out if they knew or not. Rather he was telling them something. It could also be translated as “You should have known.” (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
    * **Must be**-Jesus says I continually need to be about my Father's business
    * **at my Father's house**  - Jesus was referring to the temple, and when he said "my Father" he was referring to God. But the next verse says that they did not understand what he was telling them. So it would be best not to explain it more.
