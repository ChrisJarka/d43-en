===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **"the thing that I feared has come on me, what I was afraid of has come to me"**  - The things that Job has feared most, losing his children and posessions, has come upon him. He is using parallelism here to illustrate to strengthen his point. AT: "My worst nightmare has come true." or "My worst fear has come true." (See: Parallelism)
  * **"I am not at ease, I am not quiet, and I have no rest"**
 - Job is again using parallel phrases that are very similar to show his anxiety over his situation. AT: "I am very anxious" or "I am emotionally and physically very upset"
  * **"trouble comes instead"**  - the Hebrew word here expresses the idea of distress, misery, and pain.
