===== What To Do when the Translation Is Completed =====

==== Put Your Work Online ====

When you are done with your translation, and even before you are done, we encourage you to put your work online at door43.org. If you have done your work on Door43, your work is already there! If you are working in translationStudio, there is an upload button that allows you to upload your work directly onto Door43.

By uploading your work while the translation is in progress it allows others to see your work, become excited in it, participate in the translation and checking process, and benefit from hearing God's Word in their own language! Another added benefit of uploading a completed language which has been checked to at least a Level 1 is that the content is published on the unfoldingWord website which in turn populates the unfoldingWord mobile app. This greatly enhances the ease of distribution. In addition, the text will be rendered as a print-ready PDF which will allow for printing of hard-copy books as well. 

==== Distribute the Finished Product ====

Ultimately our goal is to get the finished translation to the people who need it. This can be done by showing them the [[https://unfoldingword.org/stories|unfoldingWord website]], downloading the app, sharing the files by email, Bluetooth, etc, or by making printed copies of Open Bible Stories available. 

==== Record the Audio ====

Another great way to help people understand Open Bible Stories is to record someone reading a translation of Open Bible Stories that has been checked to Level 3. If you are interested in recording the Stories, please contact Brad at [[brad@unfoldingword.org]]. He will help you to do a high quality recording of these Stories. 

==== Make Videos ====

Once the audio recordings have been made, videos can be automatically made of each story. To see a sample, click [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCLd3ruQUwk|here]]. This video generator proof of concept is functional and can be run manually, but development for fully automated video rendering is still in production.

==== Begin Translating the Bible ====

Door43 and translationStudio are now able to be used as platforms for translating the Bible! Several books of the Bible are now ready for translation!

Thank you for being faithful to God's calling to help “make disciples of every nation”!
