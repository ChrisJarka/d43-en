===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Joel's description of the coming army continues.

  * **A fire is consuming everything in front of it** - A fire destroys everything as it moves, and the "army" ([[:en:bible:notes:jol:02:01|2:2]]), whether of humans or of locusts, destroys everything as it moves. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **behind it a flame is burning** - After a wall of flame goes through dry land and burns the dryest and smallest fuel, there will still be flames as the larger and less dry fuel burns, (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **land is like the garden of Eden** - The garden of Eden was a beautiful place, and the land was beautiful. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
