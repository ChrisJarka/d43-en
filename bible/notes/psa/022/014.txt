\v 14 I am completely exhausted,
\q2 and all my bones are out of their joints.
\q1 I no longer expect that God will save me;
\q2 I am completely discouraged.
\q1
\v 15 My strength is all dried up 
\q2 like a broken piece of a clay jar that has dried in the sun.

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 I am being poured out like water,
\q and all my bones are dislocated.
\q My heart is like wax;
\q it melts away within my inner parts.
\q
\v 15 My strength has dried up like a piece of pottery;
\q my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.
\q You have laid me in the dust of death.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I am being poured out like water** - "Someone is pouring me out like water." The writer is comparing himself to water that is wasted on the ground. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **all my bones are dislocated** - "all my bones are out of place." This describes the emotional pain the writer experiences as if it were physical pain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **heart is like wax** - This phrase compares the heart as very weak like wax which melts easily. His heart is not really made of wax. 
  * **strength has dried up like a piece of pottery** - Again, this is a picture of how little strength he has left. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
