==== Description ====

A metaphor occurs when someone speaks of one thing as if it were a different thing. The speaker does this in order to effectively describe the first thing by implying that in some important way it is similar to the other.  The thing he speaks of is called the **topic**. The thing he calls it is the **image**. The way that they are similar is the **point of comparison**.

In the metaphor below, the speaker describes the woman he loves as a rose. Both are beautiful and delicate. 
  * My love is a red, red rose. 

1. Sometimes the **topic** and the **image** are both stated clearly. 

>Jesus said to them. â€œ__I am the bread of life__. He who comes to me will not hunger, and he who trust believes in me will never thirst." (John 6:35 ULB)

Jesus called himself the bread of life. The topic is "I" and the image is "bread." Bread is a food that people ate all the time. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to believe in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.

2. Sometimes only the **image** is stated clearly.

>Produce __fruits__ that are worthy of repentance (Luke 3:8 [[ULB]])

The image here is "fruits". The topic is not stated, but it is actions or behavior. Trees can produce good fruit or bad fruit, and people can produce good behavior or bad behavior. Fruits that are worthy of repentance are good behavior that is appropriate for people who have repented.

=== Purposes of Metaphor ===

  * One purpose of metaphor is to teach people about something that they do not know (the **topic**) by showing that it is like something that they already know (the **image**).
  * Another purpose  is to emphasize that something has a particular quality or to show that it has that quality in an extreme way.
  * Another purpose is to lead people to feel the same way about one thing as they would feel toward another.
  * Often metaphors are the favorite way for speakers of a language to talk about something. In this case, the speakers are usually not aware that they are using metaphors. For example, when English speakers talk about the amount of something changing, they often say that it is going up or down. ("The literacy rate is going up." "The price of bread has gone up.") Or, when English speakers say, "This road goes to the next town," they are unaware that they are speaking as if the road were in motion. Other languages require their speakers to use other expressions, for example, "Bread is eating more of our money," "This road connects us to the next town."

=== Reasons this is a translation issue  ===
  * People may not realize that that a word is being used as an image in a metaphor.
  * People may not be familiar with the thing that is used as an image. 
  * If the topic is not stated, people may not know what the topic is.
  * People may not know how the topic and the image are alike.

=== Translation Principles  ===
  * Make the meaning of a metaphor as clear to the target audience as it was to the original audience.
  * Do not make the meaning of a metaphor more clear to the target audience than it was to the original audience.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>__I am the good shepherd__. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. (John 10:11 ULB)

In the metaphor above, the topic is "I" and the image is "the good shepherd." Jesus called himself the good shepherd. A good shepherd saves the lives of his sheep even if it would put his own life in danger. Jesus wanted to save his people and would die in order to do it.

>Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of __the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees__." The disciples reasoned among themselves and said, "It is because we took no bread." (Matthew 16:6-7 ULB)

Jesus used a metaphor, but his disciples did not realize it. When he said "yeast," they thought he was talking about bread, but "yeast" was the image in his metaphor about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Since the disciples did not understand what Jesus meant, it would not be good to state clearly here what Jesus meant.

==== Translation Strategies ====
If people would understand the metaphor in the same way that the original readers would have understood it, consider using it. If not, here are some other strategies.

  - [[If the target audience would think that the phrase should be understood literally,]] change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding "like" or "as."
  - If the target audience would not know the **image**, see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] for ideas on how to translate that image.
  - If the target audience would not [[use that **image** for that meaning]] use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. 
  - Or, if the target audience would not [[use that **image** for that meaning]], simply state the truth that the metaphor was used to communicate.
  - If the target audience would not know what the **topic** is, then state the topic clearly. (However, do not do this if the original audience did not know what the topic was.)
  - If the target audience would not know how the topic is like the image, state it clearly.
  - If the metaphor seems to be a normal way to say something in the biblical language, a translation note often points this out. In this case, express the main idea in the simplest [[<del>possible</del>]] way preferred by your language. 

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. If the target audience would [[think that the phrase should be understood literally,]] change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding "like" or "as."

  * **I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.** (John 10:11 [[ULB]])
    *  "I am __like__ a good shepherd. A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."  <del>[[(John 10:11)]]</del>

2. If the target audience would not know the **image**, see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] for ideas on how to translate that image.

  * **Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you __to kick a goad__.** (Acts 26:14 ULB)
    * "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against a pointed stick."

3. If the target audience would not [[use that **image** for that meaning]], use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. 

  * **his hand was leprous, as white as __snow__.** (Exodus 4:6 [[ULB]]) - If people would not know what snow is, you could choose something else that is very white.
    * "his hand was leprous, as white as milk"
    * "his hand was leprous, as white as the moon"

4. Or, if the target audience would not [[use that **image** for that meaning]], simply state the truth that the metaphor was used to communicate.

  * **I will make you become __fishers__ of men.** (Mark 1:17 [[ULB]] )
    * "I will make you become __people who gather__ men"
    * "Now you gather fish. I will make you gather people."

5. If the target audience would not know what the **topic** is, then state the topic clearly. (However, do not do this if the original audience did not know what the topic was.)

  * **Produce __fruits__ that are worthy of repentance** (Luke 3:8 ULB)
      * "Produce __actions__ that are worthy of repentance" 

6. If the target audience would not know how the topic is like the image, state it clearly.
  * [[Chris, please remove "the light of the world" example and add the good shepherd example below - I tried to use the brackets, but it doesn't work well.]]
  * **I am the good shepherd.** (John 10:11 ULB)
    * "I am the one who __cares for__ God's people as a shepherd cares for sheep."
  * **Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you __to kick a goad__.** (Acts 26:14 ULB)
  * "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? You __fight against me and hurt yourself__ like an ox that kicks against its owner's pointed stick."  [[I changed the underlining.]]

7. If the metaphor seems to be a normal way to say something in the biblical language, a translation note often points this out. In this case, express the main idea in the simplest [[<del>possible</del>]] way preferred by your language.

  * **For after David had in his own generation served the desires of God, __he fell asleep__, was laid with his fathers, and saw decay,**  (Acts 13:36 ULB)
    * "For after David had in his own generation served the desires of God, __he died__, was laid with his fathers, and saw decay,"
