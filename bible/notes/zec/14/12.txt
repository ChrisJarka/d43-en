\v 12 This will be the plague with which Yahweh will attack all the peoples that waged war against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot away even as they are standing on their feet. Their eyes will rot in their sockets and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
\v 13 On that day that great fear from Yahweh will come among them. Each one will seize the hand of another, and the hand of one will be raised up against the hand of another.
