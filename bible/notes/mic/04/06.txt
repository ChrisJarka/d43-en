\v 6 In that day, says Jehovah, will I assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that
which I have afflicted;
\v 7 and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Jehovah will reign
over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.
\v 8 And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, yea, the former dominion shall
come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
