\v 20 So, do you know \add what God thinks\add* about what \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* people who \f + \ft irony \f* consider themselves to be wise and scholars and philosophers say? \add He does not pay attention to what they say, because\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* he has shown clearly that what unbelievers \add think is\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise is \add not wise at all\add*, but is really foolish.
\v 21 God, acting very wisely, made it impossible for unbelievers to know God by doing what they thought was \f + \ft irony \f* wise. Instead, he was happy to save those who trust \add in Christ\add* as the result of their hearing \add the message that\add* was proclaimed to them, a message that others consider to be foolish.

\v 20 So where is the man who knows all the wisdom of this world? Where is he who studies human science and history? And where is the one who tries to convince you with brilliant arguments and compelling politics? God has declared that all the wisdom of this world is just foolishness, no matter how it is displayed.
\v 21 When the world acted on the basis of its wisdom, it could never find God. But God had a different plan. Through the proclamation of the message about Jesus Christ--which seemed so foolish to many--so that by his power, God saved those who believed the message.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Where is the wise? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater of this world? Has not God turned the wisdom of the world into foolishness?
\v 21 Since the world in its wisdom did not know God, God used the foolishness of preaching to be the means by which he saves those who believe.
