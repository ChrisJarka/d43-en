\v 39 When it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a beach, and they discussed whether they could drive the ship upon it.
\v 40 So they cut loose the anchors and left them in the sea.  At the same time they loosed the ropes of the rudders and raised the foresail to the wind; and so they headed to the beach.
\v 41 But they came to a place where two currents met, and the ship ran into the ground. The bow of the ship stuck there and remained
unmoveable, but the stern began to break up because of the waves' violence.
