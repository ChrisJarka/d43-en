===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You will not bow down to them or serve them** - "You will not bow down to the carved figures or worship them"
  * **am a jealous God** - This means God wants his people to only worship him.
  * **to thousands of them** - "to thousands of generation" or "to the thousandth generation." Here, "thousands" does not refer to a definite number of generation. It basically means he will show covenant faithfulness to those generations forever. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
