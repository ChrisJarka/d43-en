\v 11 They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God
of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it kill us not, and our people. For there was a deadly discomfiture
throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
\v 12 And the men that died not were struck with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
