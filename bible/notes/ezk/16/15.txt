\v 15 'But you trusted in your own beauty, and you acted like a whore because of your fame; you poured out your acts of prostitution on
everyone who passed by. You became the property of those men!

This should not have come about! It should not have been!

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But you trusted in your own beauty** - "thought your own beauty could provide for your needs"
  * **acted like a whore** - This phrase compares the people of Israel worshiping idols with a woman who is paid to have sex with strangers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **you poured out your acts of prostitution on everyone who passed by.** - The word "poured" is not refering to a liquid. It is possibly referring to the woman having sex with any man who came to her.
  * **You became the property of those men!** - This verse is not telling the reader that the woman was sold to other men. It seems to be telling the reader that having sex with the men may make her obedient to them or that she has entered into a covenant or committment similar to marriage with them.
  * **made for yourself high places decked with various colors** - Alternate translation: "built beautiful places for worshipping idols" or "make beautifully decorated shrines" (UDB).
