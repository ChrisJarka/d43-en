====== unholy, common, defiled ======

===== Definition: =====

Anything that is common or unholy is something that has not been set apart by God as having special significance to Him.  Anything or anyone that becomes defiled was considered holy but is now seen as unholy, usually temporarily.

  * In the Bible, certain animals were considered unholy to God, meaning people should not eat their meat.
  * An example of a person who was considered holy by God but becomes temporarily defiled is when the person has an illness and is separated from people to avoid spreading the illness. He is later considered to be holy again when the illness is gone.
