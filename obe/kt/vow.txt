====== vow ======

===== Definition: =====

A vow is a promise that a person makes to God that the person will do something to show devotion to God.

  * A vow may be given purely to express devotion and love to God without asking for anything from God in return.
  * A vow may be given to God because the person is requesting God's special protection, provision or presence in exchange for making the vow.
  * God is not required to fulfill a person's request given in a vow to God.
  * A vow is voluntary, but once made it becomes legally binding on the person who made it.
  * Failure to keep a vow makes the person who made the vow subject to God's judgment.
