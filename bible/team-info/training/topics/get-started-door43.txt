===== How to Add My Information =====

All the pages under the "workbench" namespace are inputs for translation training resources.

=== Suggestion: You might find it convenient to right click on links and choose "Open in new window." ===

Adding content in Door43 is easy! Follow these simple steps to get started:

===== 1. Create an Account & Log into Door43 =====

To start adding content, you will need a user account on Door43. If you do not have an account, [[:en:get-started?do=register|create one]] then you can [[https://door43.org/en/obs-training/get-started?do=login&sectok=ee4e19eb537ef77891aa5a6b54b7b2a4|login]].\\
You can watch this [[http://youtu.be/dpsJRDAa3I8|video]] (45 seconds long) to see how to set up an account.

  * Click on the Register link at the top of the page.
  * Fill in the necessary information to set up an account.
  * Check your email for the automatic generated password. (You might find the email in your spam folder.)
  * Click on the 'Update Profile' link to change the password.

===== 2. Practice Editing a Page =====

Door43 has a [[:playground:playground|test page]] that you can freely edit to try things out. 

**Graphical Editor**  â€“ When you click the "Edit this page" button, you will see an edit window that looks like a simplified word processor. Click [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFK1zK_dSYc|here]] for the "how to" 1 minute video. The buttons take care of formatting text and generally make it easier to use. Here is information on the toolbar icons: [[doku>toolbar|quickbuttons]].
