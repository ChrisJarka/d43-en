\v 11 And you--because of the blood of my covenant with you--I have set free your prisoners from the pit where there is no water.
\v 12 Return to the stronghold, prisoners of hope! Even today I am declaring that I will return double to you,
\v 13 for I have bent Judah as my bow. I have filled the quiver with Ephraim. I have roused your sons, Zion, against your sons,
Greece, and have made you like a warrior's sword!
