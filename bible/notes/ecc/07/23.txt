\v 23 All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.
\v 24 That which is, is far off and exceeding deep; who can find it out?
\v 25 I turned about, and my heart was set to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason of things, and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness.
