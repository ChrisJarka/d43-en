\v 8 Yet now for a small moment, mercy from Yahweh our God has come to leave us a survivor and to give us a stake in this holy place for our God to enlighten our eyes and 
to give us a small revival in our slavery,
\v 9 for we are servants and our God has not forgotten us but extended covenant- faithfulness upon us before the king of Persia to give us a revival to raise up 
our God's house and erect its ruins and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
