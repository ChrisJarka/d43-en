\d For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David.
\q
\v 1 Give ear to my prayer, O God;
\q And hide not yourself from my supplication.
\q
\v 2 Attend to me, and answer me:
\q I am restless in my complaint, and moan,
\q
\v 3 Because of the voice of the enemy,
\q Because of the oppression of the wicked;
\q For they cast iniquity upon me,
\q And in anger they persecute me.
\q
\v 4 My heart is sore pained within me:
\q And the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
\q
\v 5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me,
\q And horror has overwhelmed me.
\q
\v 6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove!
\q Then would I fly away, and be at rest.
\q
\v 7 Lo, then would I wander far off,
\q I would lodge in the wilderness. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 8 I would haste me to a shelter
\q From the stormy wind and tempest.
\q
\v 9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongue;
\q For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
\q
\v 10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
\q Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.
\q
\v 11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof:
\q Oppression and guile depart not from its streets.
\q
\v 12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me;
\q Then I could have borne it:
\q Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me;
\q Then I would have hid myself from him:
\q
\v 13 But it was thou, a man mine equal,
\q My companion, and my familiar friend.
\q
\v 14 We took sweet counsel together;
\q We walked in the house of God with the throng.
\q
\v 15 Let death come suddenly upon them,
\q Let them go down alive into Sheol;
\q For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.
\q
\v 16 As for me, I will call upon God;
\q And Jehovah will save me.
\q
\v 17 Evening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain, and moan;
\q And he will hear my voice.
\q
\v 18 He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me;
\q For they were many that strove with me.
\q
\v 19 God will hear, and answer them,
\q Even he that remains of old, \qs [Selah\qs*
\q The men who have no changes,
\q And who fear not God.
\q
\v 20 He has put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him:
\q He has profaned his covenant.
\q
\v 21 His mouth was smooth as butter,
\q But his heart was war:
\q His words were softer than oil,
\q Yet were they drawn swords.
\q
\v 22 Cast your burden upon Jehovah, and he will sustain thee:
\q He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.
\q
\v 23 But thou, O God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction:
\q Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days;
\q But I will trust in thee.
