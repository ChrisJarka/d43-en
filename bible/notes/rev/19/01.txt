\v 1 After these things I heard something like a loud sound of a great multitude in heaven saying,
\q "Hallelujah. 
\q Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God,
\q2
\v 2 because true and righteous are his judgments, 
\q for he has judged the great prostitute, 
\q2 who has corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, 
\q and he has avenged the blood of his servants 
\q2 which came from her hand."
