<usfm>
\v 6 I myself have chosen the descendants of Levi from the other Israelites in order that they may be your special helpers. They are like a gift that I have given you to work at the Sacred Tent.
\v 7 But it is you and your sons, who are the priests, who must perform all the rituals concerning the altar and with what happens inside the Very Holy Place. I am giving to you this work of serving as priests. So anyone else who tries to do that work must be executed."

\v 6 Behold, I, myself  have taken your brethren the Levites from among the descendants of Israel. They are a gift to you, given to Yahweh, to do the service of the tent of meeting.
\v 7 You and your sons with you will keep your priesthood for everything of the altar and for everything within the veil. You will serve. I give you the priesthood as a given service. But, the stranger that comes near will be put to death.
