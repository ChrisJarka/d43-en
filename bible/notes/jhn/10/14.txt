\v 14 I am like a good shepherd. Just like a good shepherd knows his sheep, I know those who belong to me, and they know me
\v 15 in the same way as my Father knows me and I know my Father. Furthermore, I am ready to sacrifice myself for those who belong to me.
\v 16 And I have other people who are not Jews who will some day belong to me. They will be like sheep from another sheep pen. I must bring them to God. They will pay attention to what I say, and eventually all those who belong to me will be like one
flock, and I will be like their one shepherd.

<usfm>
\v 14 I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me,
\v 15 even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.
\v 16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and they shall
become one flock, one shepherd.
