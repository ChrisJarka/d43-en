====== oath, swear ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, an oath is a formal promise to do something. It can also be an emphatic promise to tell the truth.

  * In the Bible, the term "swear" means to say an oath.
  * Sometimes these two terms are used together as in, "swear an oath."
  * Abraham and Abimelech swore an oath when they made a covenant together concerning the use of a well.
  * Abraham told his servant to swear (formally promise) that he would find Isaac a wife from among Abraham's relatives.
  * God also made oaths in which he made promises to his people.
  * An oath was binding on the one making the oath.
  * A modern-day use of the word "swear" means to use foul language. This is not its meaning in the Bible.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Depending on the context, "an oath" could also be translated as "a pledge" or "a solemn promise."
  * "To swear (an oath)" could be translated by "to formally promise" or "to pledge" or "to commit to do something."
  * Make sure the translation of "swear" or "oath" does not refer to cursing. In the Bible it does not have that meaning.
