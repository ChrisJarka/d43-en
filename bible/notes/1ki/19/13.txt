\v 13 When Elijah heard that, he wrapped his cloak around his face. He went out of the cave and stood at its entrance. And he heard Yahweh speaking to him, saying again, "Elijah, why are you here?"
\p
\v 14 He replied again, "I have zealously served you, Yahweh, God Almighty. But the Israelite people have rejected the agreement that they made with you. They have torn down your altars, and they have killed all of your prophets. I am the only one whom they have not killed, and now they are trying to kill me, too. \add So I am running away from them\add*."

\v 13 So when Elijah heard it he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. Then there came a voice to him which said, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
\v 14 Elijah replied, "I have been very jealous for Yahweh, God Almighty, because the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, destroyed your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword. Now I, and I only, am left, and they seek to take my life away too.
