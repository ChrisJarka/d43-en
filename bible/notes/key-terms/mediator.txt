====== mediator ======

===== Definition: =====

A mediator is a person who helps two parties resolve their differences and become reconciled.

  * The wrath of God is the result of sin, and the punishment for sin is death.
  * Because of sin, the relationship between people and God is broken. Jesus is the mediator between God the Father and people, restoring that broken relationship through his death as payment for their sin.
  * Reconciliation was made possible because of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, taking the punishment of death for sin that people deserved.
  * Ways to translate "mediator" could be, "go-between person" or "reconciler" or "person who brings peace."
