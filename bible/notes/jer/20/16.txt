<usfm>
\v 16 And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and
shouting at noontime;
\v 17 because he killed me not from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.
\v 18 Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
