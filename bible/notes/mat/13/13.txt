\v 13 That is why I use parables when I speak to people, because although they see \add what I do\add*, they do not perceive \add what it means\add*, and although they hear \add what I say\add*, they do not really understand \add what it means\add*.
\v 14 What these people do completely fulfills what \add God told\add* the prophet Isaiah \add to say long ago to the people who did not\add* try to understand what he said, \p You will hear \add what I say\add*, but you will not understand it. You will keep seeing \add what I do\add*, but you will not understand \add what it means\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*. \p

\v 13 So I talk to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, neither do they
understand.
\v 14 To them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, that which says, 
\q 'While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand;
\q While seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I talk to them**  - "Them" here is referring to the crowd.
  * **because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear**  - Jesus uses this doublet to tell the disciples that the crowd does not understand.  (see: Doublet)
  * **While hearing you will hear**- This begins a quote from the prophet Isaiah about the unbelieving people of Isaiah's day. Jesus is using this quote to describe the crowd that was listening to Him. This is a doublet. (See Doublet.)
