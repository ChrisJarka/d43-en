\v 4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and
thus were they divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of
Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight.
\v 5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of
the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
