<usfm>
\v 3 Among all the other men, this man is the one who loves me; he is like a tree that grows in the forest.

\v 4 He led me to the room where I feasted on his love,
\q2 where he made love to me as if he were covering me with his love.

\q
\v 3 As an apricot tree among the trees of the forest,

\q
\v 4 He brought me to the house of wine,
\q and his banner over me was love.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **As an apricot tree ... the young men** - People enjoy the fruit of an apricot tree, but the trees of the forest do not bear fruit. The woman enjoys being with the man, but not with the other young men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **apricot tree** - a tree that produces a small yellow fruit that is very sweet. If your readers will not know what this is, you could use the word for another fruit tree or the general word "fruit tree."
  * **the forest** - The Hebrew word here refers to land where trees grow for which people have no use.
  * **beloved** - Some versions such as the UDB understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13]].
  * **I sit down under his shadow with great delight** - The woman finds great joy and comfort in being so near to the man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and his fruit is sweet to my taste** - The woman enjoys eating sweet fruit, and she enjoys being near to the man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the house of wine** - Possible meanings are 1) the very large room where the king would serve many people large meals with wine or 2) a small booth in a vineyard where the man and woman could be alone together.
  * **his banner over me was love** - One possible meaning is that the banner is a metonym for a metaphorical military escort. The woman was nervous about entering the banqueting hall, but the man's love gave her courage to enter. AT: "but his loving protection guided me and gave me courage." Another possible meaning is that the woman knew that the man wanted to make love to her from the way he looked at her. AT: "he looked at me lovingly" or "when he looked at me, I knew he wanted to make love to me" Another possible meaning is that they made love. AT: "he lovingly covered me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
