\v 1 Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said,
\q
\v 2 Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty?
\q He that argueth with God, let him answer it.
\p
\v 3 Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,
\q
\v 4 Behold, I am of small account; What shall I answer thee?
\q I lay my hand upon my mouth.
\q
\v 5 Once have I spoken, and I will not answer;
\q Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.
\p
\v 6 Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
\q
\v 7 Gird up your loins now like a man:
\q I will demand of thee, and declare you to me.
\q
\v 8 Wilt you even annul my judgment?
\q Wilt you condemn me, that you may be justified?
\q
\v 9 Or have you an arm like God?
\q And can you thunder with a voice like him?
\b
\q
\v 10 Deck yourself now with excellency and dignity;
\q And array yourself with honor and majesty.
\q
\v 11 Pour forth the overflowings of your anger;
\q And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.
\q
\v 12 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low;
\q And tread down the wicked where they stand.
\q
\v 13 Hide them in the dust together;
\q Bind their faces in the hidden place.
\q
\v 14 Then will I also confess of you
\q That your own right hand can save thee.
\b
\q
\v 15 Behold now, behemoth, which I made as well as thee;
\q He eats grass as an ox.
\q
\v 16 Behold now, his strength is in his loins,
\q And his force is in the muscles of his belly.
\q
\v 17 He moveth his tail like a cedar:
\q The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
\q
\v 18 His bones are as tubes of brass;
\q His limbs are like bars of iron.
\b
\q
\v 19 He is the chief of the ways of God:
\q He only that made him gives him his sword.
\q
\v 20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food,
\q Where all the beasts of the field do play.
\q
\v 21 He lies under the lotus-trees,
\q In the covert of the reed, and the fen.
\q
\v 22 The lotus-trees cover him with their shade;
\q The willows of the brook compass him about.
\q
\v 23 Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not;
\q He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.
\q
\v 24 Shall any take him when he is on the watch,
\q Or pierce through his nose with a snare?
