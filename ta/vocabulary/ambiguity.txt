====== Ambiguity ======

Ambiguity is a literary tool that has a variety of purposes but must be used with deliberation.  The term can refer to a word, phrase or entire passage; ambiguous text can be interpreted in more than one way.Sometimes third-person pronouns (i.e. he, they, we) or indefinite time words (i.e. still, later) create unintended ambiguity. Used carelessly, ambiguity can lead a reader to a wrong conclusion.  However, when applied deliberately, ambiguity can deepen the reader's involvement with a passage, provide humor or allow for information sharing that is devoid of details that might interfere.

Total consistency in human behavior is abnormal; Shakespeare's Hamlet, for example, sometimes acted morally and other times not.  The ambiguous nature of his character draws a reader in to dwell on him more fully than a totally predictable character might.  In poetry, phrases such as Blake's "...in the howling storm" evokes different images in different readers--but engages the heart and mind vividly.  Ambiguity used in that manner connects readers to the text.</font>

Ambiguity is sometimes a deliberate word play intended to amuse or draw attention.  Words that have dual literal or social meanings such as duck (animal or action), (animal or derogatory description of a person), and

Ambiguity is also useful when a narrator wishes to share some information but not too much detail.  It can help a writer protect the identity of individuals or locations.  Ambiguity is useful when one wishes to convey significant concepts without detailed definitions (i.e. 'before time began).
