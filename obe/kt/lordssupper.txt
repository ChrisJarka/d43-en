====== Lord's Supper ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "Lord's Supper" is used by the apostle Paul to refer to the Passover meal that Jesus ate with his disciples on the night he was arrested by the Jewish leaders. 

  * During this meal Jesus gave his disciples the bread and cup to share as was usual for the Passover meal, but he called the bread his body which would soon be beaten and killed, and the cup of wine his blood, which would soon be spilled out as he died as a sacrifice for sin.
  * Jesus commanded that as often as they shared these things together they should remember his death and resurrection.
  * The apostle Paul also further establishes it as a believer's practice in 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
  * Churches today often use the term "communion" to refer to the Lord's Supper. The term "Last supper" is often sometimes used.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * This term could also be translated as, "the Lord's meal" or "the meal of our Lord" or "the meal in memory of the Lord."
