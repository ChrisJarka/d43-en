===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer of Lamentations uses many different ways to express the people of Israel losing his favor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **The Lord has completely covered the daughter of Zion with a dark cloud** - The "dark cloud" symbolizes a warning of the punishment that is about to happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]). 
  * **Daughter of Zion…the beauty of Israel…Daughter of Judah**  - The city of Jerusalem is referred to in different ways in this passage. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

  * **day of his anger** - Here the word "day" refers to a general period of time and not to one 24-hour day. AT: "at the time when he displayed his anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **swallowed up** - This phrase refers to Israel being completely destroyed like food is completely gone when it is swallowed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
