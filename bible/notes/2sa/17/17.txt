\v 17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told
king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.
\v 18 But a lad saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim,
who had a well in his court; and they went down thither.
