\v 7 You look at the things that are before your face. If any man trusts in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ’s, so also are we.
\v 8 For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down), I shall not be put to shame:
