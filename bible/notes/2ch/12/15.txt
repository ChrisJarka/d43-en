\v 15 Now Rehoboamâ€™s deeds, first and last, are they not written in the writings of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, which also have records of genealogies? For all his life there was fighting between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
\v 16 Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David; Abijah his son reigned in his place.
