\v 8 So I want to ask you to do something. I am completely confident that I have the authority to command you to do what you should do, because I am an apostle of Christ.
\v 9 But because I know that you love God's people, I request this instead of commanding you to do it. It is I, Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner because I serve Christ Jesus, who am requesting it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I have all the boldness in Christ to command you to do what you should do** - Why Paul had this boldness could be stated more explicitly: “Because I am one of Christ's apostles, I have all the boldness to tell you what to do.” (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **all the boldness in Christ** - "much freedom to speak because of Christ" or "great confidence because of Christ" or "much courage because of Christ"
  * **yet for love's sake I am asking you instead** - "but because of love I would rather ask you" 
  * **being such a one as Paul the old man, and now also a prisoner because of Christ Jesus** - These are three reasons for Philemon to do what Paul was about to ask him to do. It can also be translated as "Because I am Paul, I am an old man, and I am now also a prisoner because of Christ Jesus."
