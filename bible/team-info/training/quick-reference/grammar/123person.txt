===== Bible Examples =====

=== Luk:09:58 ===

"Jesus said to him, 'Foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.'"

  * **Son of Man**  - Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. This could be translated as "I, the Son of Man." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:123person|First, Second or Third Person]])
=== Luk:15:04 ===

"Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep and then loses one of them, will not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the lost one until he finds it?"

  * **Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep**  - Since the parable starts with "Which one of you", some languages would continue the parable in the second person "if you have a hundred sheep." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:123person|First, Second or Third Person]])
=== Luk:17:25 ===

"But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation."

  * **But first he must suffer**  - "But first the Son of Man must suffer." Jesus was speaking about himself in the 3rd person. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:123person|First, Second or Third Person]])
