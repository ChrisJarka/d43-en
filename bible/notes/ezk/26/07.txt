\v 7 Now you yourself, son of man! I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. You will hear the words from my mouth and warn them on my behalf.
\v 8 If I say to a wicked person, 'Wicked one, you will surely die!' but if you do not announce this so that you warn the wicked about his way, then the wicked person will die in his sin, but I will require his blood from your hand!
