\v 17 So I hated being alive, because all the work that we do here on the earth distressed me. It all seemed to be useless, like trying to control the wind.


\p
\v 18 I also began to hate all the hard work that I had done here on the earth, because when I die, everything that I have acquired will belong to the one who inherits it after me.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 So I detested life because all the work done under the sun was evil to me. This was because everything is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.
\v 18 I hated all my accomplishments for which I had worked under the sun because I must leave them behind to the man who comes after me.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all the work done** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "all the work that people do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **was evil to me** - "troubled me" 
  * **vapor ... an attempt to shepherd the wind** - These two phrases are both metaphors that emphasize the idea of things being useless and futile. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **vapor** - "mist." The authors speaks of things as being useless and futile as if they were 'vapor.' Just as vapor disappears and does not last, the author speaks of things having no lasting value.  See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "as useless as vapor" or "as useless as a disappearing vapor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and an attempt to shepherd the wind** - The author speaks of everything that people do as being useless as if they were trying to control the wind. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "and as useless as trying to control the wind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **under the sun** - This refers to things that are done on earth. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:01|1:3]]. AT: "on the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **to the man who comes after me** - "to the man who inherits it after me"
