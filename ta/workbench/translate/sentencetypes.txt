===== Sentence Types =====

//This answers the question:// //What are the different types of sentences and what are they used for?//

==== Description ====

A **sentence** is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. The basic types of sentences are listed below with the functions they are mainly used for.

  * **Statements**  - These are mainly used to give information. '//This is a fact.//'
  * **Questions**  - These are mainly used to ask for information. '//Do you know him?//'
  * **Imperative Sentences**  - These are mainly used for commands or instructions. '//Pick that up.//'
  * **Exclamations**  - These are mainly used to express a strong feeling. '//Ouch, that hurt!//'


**Reasons this is a translation Issue**
  * Languages have different ways of showing that a sentence has a particular function. 
  * Some languages use these sentence types for more than one function. 
  * A sentence in the Bible may have a certain sentence type and function, but some languages would not use that type for that function.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

The examples below show each of these types used for their main functions.

=== Statements===

>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (Genesis 1:1 ULB)

Statements can also have other functions. (See [[Statements - Functions]])  ([[en:ta:workbench:translate:declarativefunctions]] workbench)

=== Questions ===
The speakers below used these questions to get information, and the people they were speaking to answered their questions.

>Jesus said to them, "__Do you believe that I can do this?__" They said to him, "Yes, Lord." (Matthew 9:28 ULB)

>The jailer...said, "Sirs, __what must I do to be saved?__" They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your house." (Acts 16:29-31 ULB)

Questions can also have other functions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

===Imperative Sentences===

There are different kinds of imperative sentences: commands, requests, instructions, and invitations.

With a **command**, the speaker uses his authority and tells someone to do something.
>Rise up, Balak, and hear. Listen to me, you son of Zippor. (Numbers 23:18 ULB)

With a **request**, the speaker uses politeness to say that he wants someone to do something. This may include the word 'please' to make it clear that it is a request and not a command.
>Give us today our daily bread. The speaker is asking for something. (Matthew 6:11 ULB)

>Please excuse me. (Luke 14:18 ULB)

With an **invitation**, the speaker uses politeness or friendliness to suggest that someone do something if he wants.
>Come with us and we will do you good. (Numbers 10:29)

With an **instruction**, the speaker tells someone how to do something. 
>...but if you want to enter into life, __keep the commandments__. ... If you wish to be perfect, __go, sell what you have, and give it to the poor,__ and you will have treasure in heaven. (Matthew 19:17, 21 ULB)

Imperative sentences also have other functions. (See: [[Commands - Functions]])  [[en:ta:workbench:translate:imperativefunctions]] workbench)

===Exclamations===

Exclamations express strong feeling. In the ULB and UDB, they usually have an exclamation mark (!) at the end. 
>Save us, Lord; we are about to die! (Matthew 8:25 ULB)

See [[Exclamation]] ([[en:ta:workbench:translate:exclamations]] workbench) for other ways that exclamations are shown and ways to translate them.

==== Translation Strategies ====

  - Use your language's ways of showing that a sentence has a particular function.
  - When a sentence in the Bible has a sentence type that your language would not use for the sentence's function, see the pages below for translation strategies.
