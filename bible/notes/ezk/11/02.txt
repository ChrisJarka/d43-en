===== Translation Notes: =====

God's vision to Ezekiel continues.

  * **city is the pot**  - Pot is described as a "utensil used for boiling" (See: Metaphor)
  * **we are the meat**  - "we are the flesh." The wicked men were frightening the people with these words to keep them from building houses in the city. This is God's quote to Ezekiel about what the wicked men were saying. (See: Metaphor)
