===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Do not trust any neighbor; put no confidence in any friend. Be careful about what you say even to the woman who lies in your arms.**  - God is showing that the very fabric of their community is breaking apart. Most people lived in small villages where neighbors work together to ensure the survivability of the community. 
    * **For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises up against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A man’s enemies are the people of his own house**  - God now shows that it's not only the village that is breaking down, but the family unit as well.
