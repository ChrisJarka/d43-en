\v 14  In regard to the people of Israel rejecting the gospel, some people might object by saying, “They certainly cannot ask Christ to help them if they have not first believed in him! And they certainly cannot believe in him if they have not heard about him! And they certainly cannot hear about him if someone does not preach to them about him!
\v 15 And those who preach to them  about Christ, certainly cannot preach if they are not sent  by God to preach! His sending messengers to them would be just like it is written in the Scriptures, ‘The arrival of those who preach the Good News is wonderful!'"

\v 14 How then do they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher?
\v 15 And how will they preach, unless they are sent? Even as it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim glad tidings of good things!"
