\v 32 But now listen to what I say to you: A man may divorce his wife only if she has committed adultery, and not for any other reason. If a man divorces his wife for any other reason, and he has sex with another woman, he makes his wife become one against whom he has committed adultery, because in God's estimation she still is his wife. Also, if a man marries a woman who is divorced, God considers him guilty of committing adultery."

\v 31 It was also said, 'Whoever sends his wife away, let him give her a certificate of divorcement.'
\v 32 But I say to you that everyone who sends his wife away, except for the cause of fornication, makes her an
adulteress; and whoever marries her after she has been sent away commits adultery.
