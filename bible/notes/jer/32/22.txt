<usfm>
\v 22 Then you gave them this land that you had sworn to their fathers to give to themâ€”a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 23 So they entered and possessed it, but did not listen to your voice or walk according to your Law. They would not do anything that you commanded them to do, 
so you proclaimed to them all of this calamity.
