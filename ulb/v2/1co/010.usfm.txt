\c 10
\p
\v 1 For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
\v 2 and were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
\v 3 and did all eat the same spiritual food;
\v 4 and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was
Christ.
\v 5 Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
\v 6 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
\v 7 Neither be you idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to
play.
\v 8 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
\v 9 Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.
\v 10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.
\v 11 Now these things happened to them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of
the ages are come.
\v 12 Wherefore let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
\v 13 There has no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted
above that you are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
\p
\v 14 Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
\v 15 I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say.
\v 16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a
communion of the body of Christ?
\v 17 seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of the one bread.
\v 18 Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?
\v 19 What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
\v 20 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would
not that you should have communion with demons.
\v 21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: you cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table
of demons.
\v 22 Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
\p
\v 23 All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.
\v 24 Let no man seek his own, but each his neighbor’s
good.
\v 25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake;
\v 26 for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.
\v 27 If one of them that believe not biddeth you to a feast, and you are disposed to go; whatever is set before
you, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake.
\v 28 But if any man say to you, This has been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for
conscience’ sake:
\v 29 conscience, I say, not your own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?
\v 30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
\v 31 Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
\v 32 Give no occasion of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:
\v 33 even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the
profit of the many, that they may be saved.
