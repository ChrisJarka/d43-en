\c 98
\d A Psalm.
\q
\v 1 Oh sing to Jehovah a new song;
\q For he has done marvelous things:
\q His right hand, and his holy arm, has wrought salvation for him.
\q
\v 2 Jehovah has made known his salvation:
\q His righteousness has he openly showed in the sight of the nations.
\q
\v 3 He has remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel:
\q All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
\q
\v 4 Make a joyful noise to Jehovah, all the earth:
\q Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.
\q
\v 5 Sing praises to Jehovah with the harp;
\q With the harp and the voice of melody.
\q
\v 6 With trumpets and sound of cornet
\q Make a joyful noise before the King, Jehovah.
\q
\v 7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
\q The world, and they that dwell therein;
\q
\v 8 Let the floods clap their hands;
\q Let the hills sing for joy together
\q
\v 9 Before Jehovah; for he comes to judge the earth:
\q He will judge the world with righteousness,
\q And the peoples with equity.
