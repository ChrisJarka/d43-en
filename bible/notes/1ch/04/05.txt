  * **Temeni ... Haahashtari** - These are understood here as the names of men. However, some versions understand them as the names of clans that were begun by the sons of Ashhur.
  * **Helah ... Naarah** - These are the names of women. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **bore him** - "gave birth to his sons"
