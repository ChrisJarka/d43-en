\v 9 It was not the man whom God created for the help of the woman, but the woman for the man. There is an order to creation.
\v 10 This is why women should cover their heads, as a sign of the authority of the man over her, and because of the presence of angels in the worship service. Women must cover their glory because the angels guard the glory of God, and women must not compete with the glory of God.

\v 10 This is why the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.
