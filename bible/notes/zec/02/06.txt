===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Ho**  - This term is an interjection/exclamation used by prophets.  "Ho" is the pronunciation in the original Hebrew.  It could mean "ah", "alas", or "woe", but is often translated as "up", "get up", "come", and "you there" in this particular verse.  The UDB has a similar idea with "run" which works well with "flee" as there is a sense of urgency.
    * **flee**  - This term means to run from danger.  God's judgment is coming on Babylon.
    * **land of the north**  - This refers to Babylon.
    * **I**  - This pronouns refers to Yahweh.
    * **scattered you**  - An alternate translation could read "spread you abroad."
    * **I have scattered you like the four winds of the skies**  - This is a simile where Yahweh says that he has scattered Israel like the wind coming from all directions scatters leaves (or anything else that is light). See [[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:simile]].
    * **you**  - Zechariah prophesied to the remnant who returned to Jerusalem with Ezra, so his primary audience was the people of Judah and Jerusalem (see Ezra 5:1).
    * **escape**  - This term means to get away from a place where you are being held.
    * **daughter of Babylon**  - This refers to Babylon and her people. Note the UDB translation: "who live in Babylon."
