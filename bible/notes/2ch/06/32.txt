\v 32 In addition, concerning the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel: when he will come from a far country because of your great name, your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm; when they come and pray toward this houseâ€”
\v 33 then please listen from heaven, your dwelling place, and act according to all for which the foreigner calls on you. Do this so that all the peoples on earth might know your name, so that they might fear you, as do your people Israel. Do this so that they might know that this
house that I have built is called by your name.
