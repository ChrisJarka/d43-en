====== Euphemism [ˈyo͞ofəˌmizəm] ======
A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant or embarrassing. It's purpose is to avoid offending the people who hear or read it.


=====Examples from English=====
**Adult beverages**\\
refers to “beer or liquor.”

**He passed away** and **He departed**\\ 
mean “He died.”

**He slept with her**\\
usually means “They had sexual relations with each other.”

**Bathroom** and **restroom**\\ 
refer to a room that has a toilet in it.


=====Examples from the Bible=====

**When a woman in the city who was __a sinner__, learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.**  Luke 7:37 \\ 
Since all people are sinners, the word __sinner__ here did not mean simply that this woman was a sinner, but that she was notably immoral. Luke may have used the word "sinner" as a euphemism for "a prostitute".

**and spoke of __his departure__, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.** Luke 9:31b\\ 
Luke wrote of Jesus' "departure" as a euphemism for his death. It can be unpleasant to talk about death, so sometimes people use euphemisms that are not so harsh sounding.


**But we don’t want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have __fallen asleep__, so that you don’t grieve like the rest, who have no hope.** 1 Thes 4:13 (WEB)\\ 
"Fallen asleep" is a euphemism for "died." Sometimes people don't like to speak directly about death because it is unpleasant.

===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * Use the euphemism that is used in the original if people would understand it.
  * Use a euphemism from your own culture.
  * State the information plainly without a euphemism if it would not be offensive.
