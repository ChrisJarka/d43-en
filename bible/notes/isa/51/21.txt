<usfm>
\v 21 So now, you people who have suffered much,
\q1 you who were acting as if you were drunk because you were drinking from his cup. 
\q2 But in truth, it is not because you have drunk out of a cup filled with wine, but because of something else that Yahweh will do. 
\q1
\v 22 Yahweh, your Lord and your God,
\q2 the one who argues your case to defend you, he says this:
\q1 "It is as though I had taken away that cup that I gave you, that cup from which you drank, and that made you nearly fall down like one who is drunk with wine. I took it away and you will not drink of it ever again. 
\q2 I will not be angry with you and cause you to drink from that cup of my anger any longer, or to suffer anymore. What I did to you is represented by a cup that holds my anger toward you, and I made you experience my anger, I made you drink from that cup. But now I promise that have I taken that cup, which represented my anger, and I have taken it away from you.


\q1
