===== Facts: =====

The Day of Pentecost occurs fifty days after Passover. It is the first day of the Festival of Weeks, which is a celebration to remember when God first gave the Law to the Israelites through Moses.

  * In the New Testament, the Day of Pentecost is especially significant because it was on this day that God poured out the Holy Spirit on Jesus' followers, after Jesus had risen from the dead and gone back to heaven.
