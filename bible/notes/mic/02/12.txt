\v 12 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of you,
\qI will surely gather the remnant of Israel.
\qI will put them together as sheep in a fold,
\qAs a flock in the midst of their pasture,
\qThey will make loud noise because of the multitude of men.
\q
\v 13 The breaker goes up before them.
\qThey break through the gate and go out,
\qTheir king passes on before them,
\qAnd Yahweh is at their head.
