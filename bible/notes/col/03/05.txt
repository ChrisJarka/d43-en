\v 5 Put to death, therefore, your sinful desires of earth--fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry.
\v 6 The wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience because of these things,
\v 7 and in these things you also once walked when you lived by them.
\v 8 Now also get rid of all these--wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy, and shameful speech from your mouth.
