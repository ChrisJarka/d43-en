===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **buried him** - This could mean that they dug a hole in the ground, placed Isaac's body in it, and covered the hole with dirt or stones. Or it could mean that they placed Isaac's body in a cave and covered the opening.
  * **covenant promises** - These were the promises that God made in his covenant with Abraham. 
  * **passed on from Isaac to Jacob** - The promises went from Abraham to his son Isaac, and now to Isaac's son Jacob. Esau did not receive the promises. See also **[[:en:obs-training:frames:06-04|[06-04]]]**.
