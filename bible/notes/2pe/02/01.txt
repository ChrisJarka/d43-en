Specifically, these teachers will even deny \add that\add* the Lord \add Jesus died to\add* pay\add for the guilt of our sins\add*. As a result, they will soon destroy themselves \add spiritually, and God will also punish them\add*.
\v 2 And many \add people\add* will behave in an extremely immoral manner, imitating the extremely immoral manner in which \add these teachers of false teaching\add* behave. As a result, \add unbelievers\add* will discredit the true message\f + \ft Or: say the true message is false \f*.

\v 1 False prophets came to the people, and false teachers will come to you. They will bring destructive heresies, and they will deny the Master who bought them. They bring to themselves quick destruction.
\v 2 Many will follow their sensuality, and they will blaspheme the way of the truth.
\v 3 They engage you greedily in business. They lie to you with their words. Judgment against them will not wait. Their destruction does not sleep.
