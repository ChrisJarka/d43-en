====== Figures of Speech ======

**Apostrophe** - In apostrophe, a speaker turns his attention from the people he is speaking to and makes an exclamation to someone who is not there with them. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:apostrophe]]

**Doublet** - A doublet states the same thought in two ways–typically, as a way to reinforce the concept. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:doublet]]

**Euphemism** - A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant, embarrassing, or socially unacceptable. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:euphemism]]

Hendiadis - In hendiadys, a single idea is expressed with two words connected with “and” rather than using one word to modify the other. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:hendiadys]]

**Hyperbole** - A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker’s feeling or opinion about something. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:hyperbole]]

**Idiom** - An idiom is a group of words that has a meaning that is different from what one would understand from the meanings of the individual words. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:]]

**Irony** - In irony, a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:irony]]

**Litotes** - Litotes is an emphatic statement made by saying that the opposite idea is not true. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:litotes]]

**Metaphor** - A metaphor creates a 'word picture' by relating one thing to an unrelated object. Metaphors state or imply that the two things have something in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor]]

**Metonymy** - Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy]]

**Parallelism** - Parallelism is the expression of one idea in two or more different ways. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:parallelism]]

**Personification** - Personification is a literary technique that attributes human characteristics to a non-human thing or idea. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:personification]]

**Rhetorical Question** - A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion]]

**Simile** - In a simile something is compared to something else of a different kind in order to focus on a particular trait that they have in common. The fact that there is a comparison is stated clearly with ‘like’ or ‘as’.  [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile]]

**Synecdoche** - Synecdoche is a figure of speech in which 1) the name of a part of something is used to refer to the whole thing, or 2) the name of a whole thing is used to refer to just one part of it. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:synecdoche]]
