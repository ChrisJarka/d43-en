====== Micah 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===
This chapter continues to be written in a poetic form about the future hope Israel has. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Messiah ==
It might be useful to know that verse 2 of this chapter is a prophecy used in other parts of the bible to show that the Messiah was born in Bethlehem. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Change in Personal Pronouns ==
Notice in verse 5 and 6 the switch to "we" and "us". It is also important to note in verses 10-15 the use of "I" when Yahweh is speaking to the Israelites. God, Himself, will be involved.
