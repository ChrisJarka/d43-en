<usfm>
\v 10 So they will mock kings and rulers are laughed at by them! They laugh at every stronghold, for they heap them up like dust and take them!
[[I filled in some implicit information, and used dust as a simile for the strongholds, as this seems to be the emphasis of the prophet on the power of the Babylonians.]]
\v 11 Then the spirit will sweep on and they will move past and be guilty, those whose might is their god!"
