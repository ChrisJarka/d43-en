===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah** - "Then Yahweh gave this message to Isaiah"
  * **the God of David your ancestor says** - "the God of your father King David says"
  * **See, I will add fifteen years to your life** - The word "See" is used to get Hezekiah's attention. Isaiah had something very important to tell him, a message directly from Yahweh. This can be translated as, "pay attention, I will not let you die, but will add fifteen more years to your life."
  * **And I will rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria** - This is a shorter way of referring to "the power or might of the King of Assyria." This can be translated as "And I, Yahweh, will rescue you, Hezekiah and this city from the mighty power of the King of Assyria." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
