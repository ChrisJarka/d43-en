\v 6-7 When they arrived in Bethlehem, there was no place for them to stay in a place where visitors usually stayed. So they had to stay in a place where animals were sheltered. While they were there the time came for Mary to give birth and she gave birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him in wide strips of cloth and placed him in an animal feeding trough as a bed for him.

\v 7 She gave birth to a son, her firstborn child, and she wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth. Then she put him in an animal feeding trough, because there was no room for them in a guest room.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **there**  - That is, "in Bethlehem."
    * **the time came**  - That is, "It was time."
    * **to deliver her baby**  - This could also be translated as, "to give birth to her baby." Use whatever expression is common in your language and which people would not be embarrassed by.
    * **an animal feeding trough**  - This trough was most likely clean and may have had something soft and dry like hay in it as a cushion for the baby.
    * **there was no room for them in a guest room**  - This could also be translated as, "there was no space in the guest room for them to stay." A guess room is a room for guests or travelers. Because of the many people who went to Bethlehem to register, Mary and Joseph had to stay in a place for animals. That is why there was a feeding trough.
    * **wrapped him snuggly in strips of cloth** - This could also be translated as, "wrapped him comfortably in a blanket." This was an expression of love and concern for the newborn baby.
    * **text**  - note
