\v 30 As for you, you human, your fellow Israelites \add here in Babylon\add* are talking about you along the city walls and at the doors of their houses. They are saying to each other, 'Come and listen to the message that has come from Yahweh.'
\v 31 My people come to you as they often have done, and they sit in front of you to listen to what you say. But they do not do what you tell them that they must do. With their mouths they say that they love me, but in their inner beings they are eager to acquire things by doing what is unjust.

\v 30 And you, son of man, the children of your people are declaring things about you beside the walls and the gates of the houses, and each declares to one another—each man to his brother—and says, ‘Let us go and listen to his word that comes out from Yahweh!’
\v 31 So they will come to you as people entering in and my people will sit before you and listen to your words but will not do them, since their passions are in their mouth their hearts are walking after their violent gains
