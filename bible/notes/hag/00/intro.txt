====== Introduction to Haggai ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of Haggai ===

  - The Temple must be completed is Yahweh’s blessings are going to be restored to the nation (1:1–15)
  - The smaller and less impressive Temple will be more glorious than the first (2:1–9)
  - Disobedience causes failure in worship; sinful selfishness leads to crop failures (2:10–19)

=== What is Haggai about? ===

The purpose of Haggai was to encourage the returning exiles to construct a second Temple in Jerusalem. His short prophetic ministry lasted only a few months, but his words of encouragement were so effective that the work was quickly completed. Haggai linked certain disobediences of the people of Israel or failures to follow the Law as reasons for economic hardship  and crop failures. The problems with their economy and their failing crops could be solved by their obedience to the Law of Yahweh. Also, he accused the Levites of failing in their service to Yahweh.
