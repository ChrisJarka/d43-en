<usfm>
\v 1 Just like there were false prophets among the \add Israelite\add* people \add long ago\add*, so there will also be teachers of false \add teachings\add* among you. They will enter \add your congregations\add* without you realizing \add what\f + \ft Or: who \f* they are\add*, and they will \add spiritually\add* injure some people by what they teach. Specifically, these teachers will even deny \add that\add* the Lord \add Jesus died to\add* pay\add for the guilt of our sins\add*. As a result, they will soon destroy themselves \add spiritually, and God will also punish them\add*.
\v 2 And many \add people\add* will behave in an extremely immoral manner, imitating the extremely immoral manner in which \add these teachers of false teaching\add* behave. As a result, \add unbelievers\add* will discredit the true message\f + \ft Or: say the true message is false \f*.
\v 3 Because \add the teachers of false teaching\add* want a lot of things that other people have, \add they think that\add* by telling you stories that they themselves have made up\f + \ft Or: invented \f*, they will get money from you. \add God decided\add* long ago \add that he would\add* punish them, and he has not fallen asleep \f + \ft litotes \f*! \add He will certainly destroy them\add*!

\v 1 Long ago, various people among the Israelites pretended to give true messages from God, and people will do the same with you. At first you will not know who they are, and they make some stop trusting in Christ; they will start thinking that the Lord is not importantâ€”although he is the one who redeemed them. But soon, God will make these false prophets perish.
\v 2 And many believers will imitate how these false prophets live. In thsi way they will insult what is true about God.
\v 3 They will tell you lies in such a way that they will make money off you. God will not wait very long before he punishes them; they will soon perish.

\v 1 False prophets came to the Israelites, and false teachers will come to you. They will secretly bring with them  destructive heresies, and they will deny the Master who bought them. They are bringing quick destruction upon themselves.
\v 2 Many will follow their sensuality, and through them the way of truth will be blasphemed.
\v 3 They will greedily make a profit off you with deceptive words. Against them condemnation will not wait long; their destruction is not idle.
