<usfm>
\v 6 I hope\f + \ft Or: wish \f* that they will be \add of no value\add*, like grass that grows on the roofs of houses
\q2 that dries up and does not grow tall;
\q1
\v 7 as a result no one \add cuts it and\add* puts it in bundles and carries it away \add to thatch a roof with it\add*.
\q1
\v 8 People who pass by \add and see men harvesting grain usually greet them by saying to them\add*,
\q2 "We wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that Yahweh will bless you!"
\q1 But this will not happen \add to those who hate Israel\add*
\q2 \add because they will not harvest any grain\add*.
\q1 We, acting as Yahweh's representatives, bless you \add Israelites\add*!

<usfm>
\q
\v 6 May they be like the grass on the housetops,
\q That withers before it grows up;
\q
\v 7 That cannot fill the reaper's hand,
\q Or the lap of the one  who binds sheaves.
\q
\v 8 Those who pass by will not say,
\q "The blessing of Yahwah be on you;
\q We bless you in the name of Yahwah."
</usfm>
