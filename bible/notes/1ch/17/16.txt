\v 16 Then David the king went in and sat before Yahweh; he said, "Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my family, that you have brought me to this point?
\v 17 For this was a small thing in your sight, God. You have spoken of your servant's family for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, Yahweh God.
\v 18 What more can I, David, say to you? You have honored your servant. You have given your servant special recognition.
