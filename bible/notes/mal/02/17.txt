====== Malachi 02:17 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Yahweh \add also says\add*, "What you have said has caused me to become disgusted."
\p You reply, "What have we said that caused him to become disgusted?"
\p The answer is that you have caused him to become disgusted by saying that Yahweh is pleased with all those who do what is evil. You have caused him to become disgusted by constantly asking, "Why does God not act justly\f + \ft Or: fairly \f*?"
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 You have made Yahweh lose his paitence with you by saying all those disgusting things. But you dare to ask, "How have we made him impatient?"

\p The answer is that you have said that Yahweh is pleased with all those who do what is evil, that he actually views them as good. And you have also made him impatient by always saying, "Why does God not act justly toward us?"
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 17 You have wearied Yahweh with your words. But you say, "How have we wearied him?" By saying, "Every one who does evil is good in the eyes of Yahweh, and he delights in them," or "Where is the God of justice?"
</usfm>

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You have wearied Yahweh** - That is, "You have exasperated Yahweh." God cannot grow weary in a physical or emotional sense.
  * **How have we wearied him?** - This expression stands as a refusal to admit to having done any wrong. It does not actually ask for information. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **By saying** - That is, "You have wearied him by saying" This is the prophet's answer to the rhetorical question. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Where is the God of justice?** - The priests are claiming either that Yahweh does not care whether people do evil or not, or that he never punishes evildoers. AT: "God certainly does not do justice against evil people!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
