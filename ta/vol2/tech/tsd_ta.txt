**NOTE: The translationAcademy manuals can be translated using either the translationStudio-Desktop program or on the git.door43.org website. It is the decision of the translation team which interface to use. **

==== Using translationStudio-Desktop ====

=== Create a translationAcademy Project ===

From any screen in the program, click on the 3-dot menu icon found in the bottom left corner of the window.
  * Click on the word "Home."
  * Add a new project by clicking on the blue circle with a plus sign (+) in the top right corner of the window.
    * Choose a target language.
    * Choose **translationAcademy Vol 1** or **translationAcademy Vol 2** in the next window. The Project opens.

**Note**: Only if the program is set up to do Gateway Languages will you see the projects 'translationWords', '**translationAcademy Vol 1**', or '**translationAcademy Vol 2**.' See: [[ en:ta:vol2:tech:tSd_settings]] for more information.

=== Start the translationAcademy Project ===

There are two panels displayed in the translationAcademy project window:
  - The source text in the left panel.
  - The target language translation will be in the right panel.

=== Translate the translationAcademy ===

  * Translate the title of the translationAcademy topic in the top section on the right panel. 
    * Left click above the red line on the 'Translate title here' words.
    * Type in the translation of the translationAcademy title.
  * Translate the information for the translationAcademy.
    * Left click on the words 'Translate text here' and start typing the translation.

Write translations that will help the Other Language translators understand translation guidelines and strategies.


=== Mark the tA Topic as Done and Go to the Next topic ===

When the translator feels that all the information has been written for the translationWord:
  * Click on the slider at the bottom right of the term to mark the word as 'done.'
  * Click on 'Confirm' in the pop-up window.

Continue to the next tW until all of the translationWords are complete.

==== Using the git.door43.org site ====
https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-intro

=== Terms to Know ===
**Fork** - to fork something is to make a branch of the master. Think of a path. This path has a split so the person walking down the path can either go to the right or stay on the main path. This is a fork in the path. \\
**Repo** - this is short for 'repository.' A repository is where all the files from a project is stored. 


=== 1. Sign onto the Git website ===
  * Go to https://git.door43.org/
  * Click on the Sign In link.
  * Sign into the site using the same Door43 Account as is used with translationStudio.
The website opens to the Dashboard of the account.

=== 2. Go to the English translationAcademy site ===
  * Click on the word 'Explore' in the top menu.
  * Type in en-ta in the search bar.
  * Click on the Search button.
There will be a list of the repositories for translationAcademy manuals. There are 9 repos in Door43. 
  - en-ta - this is not part of the manuals. 
  - en-ta-intro - the Introduction to translationAcademy Manual
  - en-ta-process - the translationAcademy Process Manual
  - en-ta-translate-vol1 - Volume 1 of the translationAcademy Translation Manual
  - en-ta-translate-vol2 - Volume 2 of the translationAcademy Translation Manual
  - en-ta-checking-vol1 - Volume 1 of the translationAcademy Checking Manual
  - en-ta-checking-vol2 - Volume 2 of the translationAcademy Checking Manual
  - en-ta-gl - the translationAcademy Gateway Language Strategy Manual
  - en-ta-audio - the translationAcademy Audio Manual
Look for only the repos that start with Door43/ before the manual - such as: **Door43/en-ta-intro**.
  * Click on the blue words for the Door43/en-ta-intro repository.

You are now in the main page of the Introduction Manual. You should see:
  * The menu for the Dashboard, Issues, Pull requests, Explore, About Door43 and Help across the top of the window.
  * On the next line is the name of the repository (Door43/en-ta-intro) and three gray boxes with the words "watch," "star," and "fork."
  * In the next line of items are the words "Code," "Issues," "Pull Requests." "Commits," "Releases," and "Wiki."
  * Check to make sure that a little below the word "code" that there is a box that has 'Branch: master'. If it does not have the word 'master,' start again from the beginning of this step.


=== 3. Fork the Repository to a new Repo ===

  * Click on the gray box with the word "Fork."
  * A window opens with the words "New Fork Repository" across the top of a box.
  * Confirm that the **Owner** is your account name.
  * The **Fork From** should be Door43/en-ta-intro.
  * Change the **Repository Name** from en-ta-intro to //your language//-ta-intro. (For example: for the Russian translation of the Introduction Manual the repo would be //ru-ta-intro//.) 
  * Add a **Description** if desired.
  * Click on the green "Fork Repository" button.

The window opens to the new repository named "//your user name/your language-ta-intro//." This repo is where you will do the translating.

**Repeat the fork action for each of the following manuals:**
  - en-ta-process - the translationAcademy Process Manual
  - en-ta-translate-vol1 - Volume 1 of the translationAcademy Translation Manual
  - en-ta-translate-vol2 - Volume 2 of the translationAcademy Translation Manual
  - en-ta-checking-vol1 - Volume 1 of the translationAcademy Checking Manual
  - en-ta-checking-vol2 - Volume 2 of the translationAcademy Checking Manual
  - en-ta-audio - the translationAcademy Audio Manual

(You will not need to translate the Gateway Language Strategies Manual.)

**To quickly find the repos that you have made:**
  * Click the 'Dashboard' link on the top menu bar. The Dashboard opens.
    * See the list of your repositories on the right? Click on one to open.
  * In one of your repositories - click on your account name at the top left. (For example: your name/language-ta-intro)
    * The list of your repositories will show.

=== 4. Edit the Pages ===
Read the information on the readme.md file that is showing in the new ta-intro repository.

Refer to the [[https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-intro/src/master/markdown_formatting.md]] page for information about the markdown used in the translationAcademy manuals. You should not need to edit any of the links.

  - Click on the blue word 'content' to open the directory of files.
  - Click on any of the files (links are blue words) to open the file.
  - Click on the pencil icon, located on the right side of the top bar. The editor opens.
  - Translate the content according to the instructions on the readme.md file in the ta-intro repository. [[https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-intro/src/master/readme.md]]
  - When done editing:
    - Edit the information in the field below the words "Commit Changes."
    - Add an optional description in the next field.
    - Click the green "Commit Changes" button to save the edits.

Continue with the next file listed on the contents. And then continue with the other repositories. 
**Remember: do not change the name of the files that end in ".md".**
