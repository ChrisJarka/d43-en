\v 11 That area is for the priests who are descendants of Zadok. They are ones who served me faithfully and did not turn away from Yahweh like most of the descendants of Levi and the other Israelite people did.
\v 12 When the land is distributed, that area will be the priests' special portion, land that is very sacred. Next to the priests' territory will be where the other descendants of Levi will live.

The temple of Yahweh will be in the middle of this special area.

\v 12 When the land is distributed, you will offer that special area to me, for it to be the priests' special portion; it is land that you will treat as very special to me. Next to the priests' territory will be where the other descendants of Levi will live.

\v 10 These will be the assignments of this holy portion of land: the priests will have land assigned to them measuring twenty-five thousand cubits in width on the north side; ten thousand cubits in width on the west side; ten thousand cubits in width on the east side; and twenty-five thousand cubits in length on the south side, with the sanctuary of Yahweh in the middle of it.
