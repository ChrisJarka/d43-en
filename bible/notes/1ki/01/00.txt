=== Structure and formatting ===

1 Kings is a continuation of 2 Samuel.


This chapter begins the reign of Solomon (1-11) and the death of David. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

David had not announced who was to succeed him; so there was competition between David's sons. Adonijah invited guests to a banquet and declared himself king. Then those favoring Solomon told David and he declared Solomon the new king.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Idiom ==
Several times in this chapter the people use the [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] "sit on the thrown" to mean be king. Solomon assures Adonijah that if he behaves himself "not a hair of his will fall to the earth" meaning he will not be harmed.
