\q1 For you, the night is \add as bright\add* as the daytime is,
\q2 because for you, daylight and darkness are not different\f + \ft Or: the same \f*.

<usfm>
\q
\v 11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me,
\q And the light about me shall be night;
\q
\v 12 Even the darkness hides not from thee,
\q But the night shineth as the day:
\q The darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
