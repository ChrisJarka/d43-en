<usfm>
\v 17 By the authority of the Lord Jesus, I strongly affirm that you must no longer live like unbelievers do. The futile way they think controls how they live.
\v 18 They are unable to think clearly about what is right or wrong. They cannot comprehend obeying God because they refuse to listen to his message, and so they do not have the eternal life that Jesus gives us.
\v 19 They have ceased to care about what is right and what is wrong and have chosen to give themselves to doing shameful things their bodies desire. The practice all kinds of immoral acts and are obsessed with them more and more.

\v 17 This I say therefore, and urge you in the Lord, that you no longer live as the Gentiles live, whose way of thinking is worthless,
\v 18 unable to understand as if their minds are in the dark, they are alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them and the stubbornness of their heart.
\v 19 Indeed they are past feeling and have given themselves over to lustful pleasure to greedily practice every kind of impurity.
