DISCUSSION NOTE TO MANAGER ADAM;  We are logged in to complete Chapter 2 and were reviewing your edits to this chapter (5) as we wrote the notes for this chapter and wanted to see if we had done it correctly.  I see that you are working on it now (you are 5 hours ahead of us as we are in Hawaii)  and I am really not understanding the changes you have made to our translations notes draft.  It seems that many of your statements are interpretations of the text, which I thought we were NOT supposed to do.  Your commentary is not part of the text in any of the translations.  So, I'm concerned that we are not understanding the task.   We will be up for quite a few hours so please feel free to call me at 808-222-0799.  thanks, Caroline Wong & Mary Scarborough
