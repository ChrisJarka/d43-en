\v 16 If the man said to the servant, "Let the priests \add cut off and\add* burn the fat first; then you can take what you want," the servant would reply, "No, give it to me now; if you do not give it to me, I will take it forcefully!"

\v 15 Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priestâ€™s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for
the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.
\v 16 And if the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as your soul desireth; then he
would say, Nay, but you shall give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
\v 17 And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah; for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.
