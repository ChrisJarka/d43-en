Abigale persuades David not to avenge himself but to leave revenge to God. Even though David's men had protected Nabal's flocks, when Nabal celebrated shearing, he refused to give anything to David's men. David decided to kill all of the males in Nabal's household. But Nabal's wife, Abigale prepared a large gift for David and brought it to him and begged him not to avenge himself. He agreed. Ten days later, Nabal died and David married Abigale.
