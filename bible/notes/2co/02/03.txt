<usfm>
\v 3 So, \add instead of going to visit you at that time\add*, I wrote a letter  \add and sent it to you\add*. I wrote it the way I did so that  \add you would know what you should do. Then\add* when I come to visit you, you will not make me unhappy when you should be causing me to rejoice. I was quite sure that all of you  \add would do what I told you to do in that letter, and because of that\add* I would be happy and you would be happy, too.
\v 4 I wrote to you  \add the way I did\add* because I felt very troubled and distressed about you. I was even crying very much as I wrote. \add My purpose in writing was\add* not in order to make you feel bad, but, instead, in order that you might know how deeply\f + \ft Or: much \f* I love you.

\v 3 I wrote to you as I did so that when I come, I would not suffer so much hurt from the very people who should bring me great joy. You want joy as much as I do.
\v 4 And I wrote to you out of the great pain I felt and the terrible hurt in my heartâ€”and I wrote to you with tears streaming down my face because I did not want to cause you any more pain, but what I wanted you to understand is how deep is my love you all.

\v 3 And I wrote as I did so that when I came to you I might not be hurt by those who should have made me rejoice. I have confidence in all of you that my joy is same joy you all have.
\v 4 For I wrote to you from great affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not wanting to cause you pain, but so you would know the depth of the love I have for you.
