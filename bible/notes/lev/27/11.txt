<usfm>
\v 11 If the animal that he wishes to dedicate to me is a kind that is unacceptable to be an offering to me, he must take the animal to the priest.
\v 12 The priest then will decide what its value is, according to the animal's good and bad points. Whatever value the priests sets will be the value of the animal, \add and that is the price that the priest must pay for the animal\add*.
\v 13 If the man who gave the animal later decides that he wants to buy it back, he must pay \add to the priest\add* that price plus an added one-fifth.

\v 11 If there is any unclean animal which cannot be offered as a sacrifice to Yahweh, then the animal must be presented before the priest, 
\v 12 and the priest will value it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest values it, so will it be.
\v 13 But if the owner redeems it, then a fifth of its value is to be added to the estimation.
