===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He taught them and said**  - The word "He" refers to Jesus and the word "them" refers to the chief priests and scribes.  
  * **It is not written**  - Jesus says this to point out what the priests and he knew was written in the Scriptures. (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **a den of robbers**  - The word "den" refers to a secret gathering place for a group of people.  A "den of robbers" is a place where robbers or thieves would gather and feel safe.  They would feel safe because this is a place where honest people do not go.  Jesus said this about them because they were using the temple as a place to make a profit off of people who had come to worship God.  (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **they feared him **- the chief priests and scribes were afraid that the people would have more respect for the teachings of Jesus than their own teachings.  They were not afraid that Jesus would hurt them but they feared, as he became more popular, they would lose influence and power in the community.
