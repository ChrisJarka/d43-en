\v 8 "Sometimes it will be very difficult for the judges to decide what really happened. He might be trying to decide whether, when someone injured or killed another person, he did it accidentally or deliberately. Or he might be trying to decide if some person is sueing another person unfairly. If in some town it is very difficult to know what really happened, with the result that the judge cannot decide it, you should go to the place that Yahweh our God has chosen for you \add to worship him\add*.
\v 9 There you should present the case to the descendants of Levi who are the priests, and to the judge who is serving at that time, and they should decide what should be done.

\v 8 If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates; then shall you arise, and get you up to the place which Jehovah your God shall choose;
\v 9 and you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge that shall be in those days: and you shall inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment.
