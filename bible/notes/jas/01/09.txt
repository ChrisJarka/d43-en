<usfm>
\v 9 Believers who are poor should be glad because God has honored them.
\v 10 And believers who are rich should be glad that God has humbled them, which helps them trust in Jesus Christ, because they and their riches will pass away, just like wild flowers wither.
\v 11 When the sun rises, the scorching hot wind dries the plants and causes the flowers to fall and no longer be beautiful. Like the flower that dies, rich people will die while they are earning money.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Let the poor brother glory in his high standing,
\v 10 but the rich brother in his humility, because he will pass away as a wild flower in the grass.
\v 11 For the sun rises with scorching heat and dries up the grass. The flower falls off, and its beauty perishes. In the same way, the rich man will fade away in the middle of his activities.
