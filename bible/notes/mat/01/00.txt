====== General notes about Matthew 1 ======


=== Formatting in this chapter ===

It is possible to produce the genealogy of this chapter as a list or a paragraph. Typically, this choice is only a matter of style or preference.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Genealogy ==
A genealogy is an list which records a person's ancestors. These were very important in determining when people where governed by a king because a king's authority was usually passed down or inherited from his father. 

== Jesus' birth ==
Matthew is careful in the way he describes Jesus' birth. Joseph is not his biological father. When Jesus was born, God became a man. If Joseph was his actual father, then Jesus would have been born a sinner.
Extra care should be taken when translating the phrases: "Mary, by whom Jesus was born," "pregnant by the Holy Spirit" and "the one who is conceived in her is conceived by the Holy Spirit."

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Passive Voice == 

The [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] is used very purposefully in this chapter to indicate that Mary and Joseph were not responsible for the birth of Jesus. They played no active role in the Jesus' birth, but were chosen by God to be the "parents" who raised Jesus on earth. Because Jesus did not share any biological traits with Mary and Joseph, many scholars have chosen to use the word "incarnation" to refer to God becoming man when Jesus was born. Many languages do not have a passive voice. Therefore, translators must decide how to best translate these theological nuances. 

Matthew also uses the passive voice in this chapter in regards to [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]]. Although the prophet speaks, it is God who has chosen the words for the prophet to speak.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Was the father of ==

In Greek, this could be translated as the verbal phrase "to become the father of." It may be necessary to rephrase this construction in order to form an acceptable sentence structure.
