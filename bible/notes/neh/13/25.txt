\v 25 So I rebuked those men, and I asked \add God\add* to curse them, and I pulled out \add some of\add* their hair. Then I forced them to solemnly promise, knowing that God \f + \ft metonymy \f* was \add listening\add*, that they would never again marry foreigners, and never allow their children to marry foreigners.
\v 26 \add I said to them\add*, "Solomon, the king of Israel, sinned \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* as a result of \add marrying\add* foreign women. He was greater than any of the kings of other nations. God loved him, and caused him to become the king of all the Israelite people, but his foreign wives caused even him to sin.
\v 27 \add Do you think that\add* we should do what you have done, and disobey our God by marrying foreign women \add who worship idols\add*? \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

\v 25 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by
God, saying, You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for
yourselves.
\v 26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved
of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.
\v 27 Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?
