<usfm>
\v 13 Even though we humans have not continuously and completely obeyed God's laws, Christ rescued us from \add God\add* punishing us eternally. Christ rescued us by his being \add the one God condemned\add* instead of God condemning us. What is written \f + \ft Or:\add someone, Or: Moses\add* wrote \f* \add in the Scriptures\add* shows that this is true. It is written \f + \ft Or:\add He\add* wrote \f*, "\add God has already\add* decided that he will punish eternally anyone \add whom people execute for his crimes and whose body they\add* hang on a tree."
\v 14 Christ rescued us in order that as a result of what Christ Jesus \add has done, God might bless the non-Jews, in a way similar to the way\add* God blessed Abraham. He also desired that as a result of our trusting \add Christ\add*, we \add all\add* might receive the Spirit \add whom God\add* promised to \add give to\add* us.

\v 13 Christ was cursed for us when he redeemed us from the curse of the law, for it is written, "Cursed is every one who hangs on a tree."
\v 14 The result is that the honor of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
