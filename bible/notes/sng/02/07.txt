===== translationNotes: =====

  * **daughters of Jerusalem** - "young women of Jerusalem." These young women could not hear her and were not present, but the woman speaks as if they were present and could hear her. 
  * **by the gazelles and the does of the fields** - These animals of the field are shy and timid, but experience absolute freedom.
  * **the gazelles** - animals that look a lot like deer and are fast, slender, and shy
  * **of the fields** - "that live in the countryside"
  * **will not awaken or arouse love until she pleases** - One possible meaning is that the abstract noun "love" is spoken of as a person who is asleep, and the daughters of Jerusalem are to allow him to sleep until he wants to awaken, a metaphor for the man and woman being married and so ready for sexual activity. Another meaning is "will not disturb us until we have finished making love." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **interrupt** - "disturb" or "bother"
