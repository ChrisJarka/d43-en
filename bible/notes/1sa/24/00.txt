====== 1 Samuel 24 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Even though Saul tried again and again to kill David, David did not avenge himself on Saul because God had chosen Saul as king. When Saul went into a cave where David was hiding, David did not kill him but just cut off a corner of his robe. Then when Saul left the cave, David came out and showed him the bit he had cut off and told Saul he would never be against him.
