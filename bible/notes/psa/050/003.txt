  * **does not stay silent**  - AT: "does not come silently"
  * **a fire devours before him, and it is very stormy around him** - Both the fire and storm are used to express God's power and the destruction of anything that is against him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He calls to the heavens above and to the earth** - The author refers to all of creation by referring to heaven and earth. God commands all of creation to help as he judges his people, just like a person could help. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
