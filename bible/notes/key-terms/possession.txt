  * Possession in the context of Acts 7:4-5 refers to confirming permanent ownership and occupation of the Land God will give the people, providing that they remain faithful to Him. It can refer to the influence of Satan over a person. It also refers to obtaining victory or property as in “possess the gates of their enemies.” God's people are also referred to as His possession meaning they belong to Him in a covenant relationship where He is exclusively their God and they are exclusively His people. It is another way of saying “have” as Peter who says “if you possess these qualities…”
