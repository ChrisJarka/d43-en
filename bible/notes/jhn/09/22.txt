\v 22 The Jews who were enemies of Jesus previously agreed with one another that they would take anyone who declared Jesus was the Christ and put them out of the synagogue.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should
confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
\v 23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
