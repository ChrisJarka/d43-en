<usfm>
\v 7 So you must build a new cart. Then get two cows that have very recently given birth to calves. They must be cows that have never been hitched to a cart \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Hitch those cows to the new cart, and take the calves away from their mothers.
\v 8 Put their god's sacred chest on the cart. Also put in the cart the five gold models of the tumors on your skin and the five gold models of rats. Put them in a small box alongside the sacred chest. They will be an offering to show that you know that you deserved to be punished \add for capturing the sacred chest\add*. Then send the \add cows\add* down the road, \add pulling\add* the cart.
\v 9 \add Watch the cart as the cows pull it\add*. If they pull it to Beth-Shemesh \add town\add* in Israel, we will know that it was their god who brought this plague on us. But if they do not take it there, we will know that it was not the god \f + \ft metonymy \f* of the Israelites who has punished us. We will know that it just happened."

\v 7 Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there has come no yoke; and tie the kine to
the cart, and bring their calves home from them;
\v 8 and take the ark of Jehovah, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which you return him for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.
\v 9 And see; if it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he has done us this great evil: but if not,
then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us; it was a chance that happened to us.
