\q
\v 4 Hear the word of Yahweh, house of Jacob and every family of the house of Israel:
\q
\v 5 Thus says Yahweh: What perversity did your fathers find against me, that they went far from following me?
\q And went after empty idols and became empty themselves?
\q
\v 6 For they did not say, “Where is Yahweh who brought us up from the land of Egypt?
\q Who led us to the wilderness of the desert land, the pit of the dry land, and the darkness of the land no man had passed through and where no man dwelt?”
