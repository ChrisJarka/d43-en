====== Burial Customs ======


===== Definition: =====


Every culture has a way to treat the physical bodies after death. The Jewish culture in both Old and New Testament typically promptly buried the body:\\ 
• in the ground\\ 
• in a cave (Abraham bought the cave of Machpelah from Ephron a Hittite. Genesis 23:7-8)\\ 
• in a tomb typically a place with many shelves for bodies. Some tombs have a stone that could be rolled over the entrance. (Jesus was buried in a new tomb. Matthew 27:59-61)\\ 
• in a catacombs (rooms below ground where people are buried in the walls)\\ 
• in a stone or wooden coffin (this practice evolved much later in biblical times)


Jacob asked Joseph for his bones to be buried with his ancestors which was not in Egypt. Genesis 47:29-30. And in Genesis 50:10 Jacob asked to be buried in the same cave as Abraham in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite. Being buried with ancestors was important through the whole of OT times.


Burial was common as seen in 1 Kings 2:31 where David commanded Benaiah to strike down Joab and then to bury him.


If a person touched a dead body or even a bone they were considered to be ritually unclean and had to undergo a 7 day ceremony to become clean again. (Numbers 19:11-16)


The New Testament dead were often washed (Acts 9:37), anointed (Mark 16:1), and wrapped in shrouds (John 19:40), hands and feet bound (John 20:7, John 11:44)


===== How to Translate =====


Unless the passage says specifically the method used to prepare the body or how to bury it pick a word in your language that is general purpose which means to “lay a body to rest.”
