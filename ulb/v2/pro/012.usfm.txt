\c 12
\q
\v 1 Whoso loves correction loves knowledge;
\q But he that hates reproof is brutish.
\q
\v 2 A good man shall obtain favor of Jehovah;
\q But a man of wicked devices will he condemn.
\q
\v 3 A man shall not be established by wickedness;
\q But the root of the righteous shall not be moved.
\q
\v 4 A worthy woman is the crown of her husband;
\q But she that makes ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.
\q
\v 5 The thoughts of the righteous are just;
\q But the counsels of the wicked are deceit.
\q
\v 6 The words of the wicked are of lying in wait for blood;
\q But the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.
\q
\v 7 The wicked are overthrown, and are not;
\q But the house of the righteous shall stand.
\q
\v 8 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom;
\q But he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.
\q
\v 9 Better is he that is lightly esteemed, and has a servant,
\q Than he that honoreth himself, and lacketh bread.
\q
\v 10 A righteous man regards the life of his beast;
\q But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.
\q
\v 11 He that tils his land shall have plenty of bread;
\q But he that follows after vain persons is void of understanding.
\q
\v 12 The wicked desires the net of evil men;
\q But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.
\q
\v 13 In the transgression of the lips is a snare to the evil man;
\q But the righteous shall come out of trouble.
\q
\v 14 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth;
\q And the doings of a man’s hands shall be rendered to him.
\q
\v 15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes;
\q But he that is wise heeds to counsel.
\q
\v 16 A fool’s vexation is presently known;
\q But a prudent man concealeth shame.
\q
\v 17 He that utters truth showeth forth righteousness;
\q But a false witness, deceit.
\q
\v 18 There is that speaks rashly like the piercings of a sword;
\q But the tongue of the wise is health.
\q
\v 19 The lip of truth shall be established for ever;
\q But a lying tongue is but for a moment.
\q
\v 20 Deceit is in the heart of them that devise evil;
\q But to the counselors of peace is joy.
\q
\v 21 There shall no mischief happen to the righteous;
\q But the wicked shall be filled with evil.
\q
\v 22 Lying lips are an abomination to Jehovah;
\q But they that deal truly are his delight.
\q
\v 23 A prudent man concealeth knowledge;
\q But the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.
\q
\v 24 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule;
\q But the slothful shall be put under taskwork.
\q
\v 25 Heaviness in the heart of a man makes it stoop;
\q But a good word makes it glad.
\q
\v 26 The righteous is a guide to his neighbor;
\q But the way of the wicked causes them to err.
\q
\v 27 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting;
\q But the precious substance of men is to the diligent.
\q
\v 28 In the way of righteousness is life;
\q And in the pathway thereof there is no death.
