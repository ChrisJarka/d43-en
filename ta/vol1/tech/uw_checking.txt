==== Checking Levels in the unfoldingWord App ====

All content that is published to Level 1 is published in the unfoldingWord app. It is our hope that by publishing these translations early and often it will increase participation and community buy-in. 

To learn more about the checking levels see [[en:ta:vol1:checking:intro_check]] and https://unfoldingword.org/quality .
