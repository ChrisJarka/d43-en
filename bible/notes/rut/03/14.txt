\v 14 So she lay at his feet until the morning. But she rose up before anyone could recognize another. For he had said, "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor."
\v 15 Then he said, "Bring your shawl, and hold it out." And when she did, he measured six large measures of barley into it, and put it on her. And he went into the city.
