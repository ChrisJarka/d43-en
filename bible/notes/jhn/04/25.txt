===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Messiah is coming** - The "is coming" here refers to being "revealed" or "appearing" or "born" in the future as opposed to arriving from another place.
    * **I, the one speaking to you, am he**  - "I am he" or "I am the Messiah". Jesus used this as a modest way to say that he is in fact "the Messiah, the Christ" that the woman mentioned.  The use of “I am he” as a reflexive pronoun  (See: ([[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:grammar:reflexive-pronoun]]). 
    * **he will declare everything to us** - The "us" here is inclusive (see: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:grammar:we-inclusive]])
