===== Choosing a Translation Team =====

This module answers the question: How do I choose a translation team?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_whatis|What is Translation]]
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_why|Why We Translate the Bible]]

Translating the Bible is a very large and difficult task that will take many people to accomplish. This module will discuss the skills that will be needed by members of the Bible translation team, and the responsibilities that these people will have. Some people will have many skills and responsibilities, and other people will have only a few. But it is important that every Bible translation team include enough people to amke sure that all of these skills are represented on the team.

===Church Leaders===
Before starting a translation project, as many church networks as possible should be contacted and encouraged to become a part of the translation and even to send some of their people to be a part of the translation team. They should be consulted and asked for their input into the translation project, its goals, and its process. 

It is good if the leaders of these churches and church networks can form a committee to guide the work, choose the translators, and encourage the churches to pray for the work and to support the work financially. 

- What is the age and local language background of each translator?

  * Does their work meet the expectations of their fellow translators and local church leaders? (Has the translator been willing to work with others in testing and checking their translation?)
