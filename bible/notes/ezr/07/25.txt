\v 25 Ezra, your God has enabled you to become very wise. Using that wisdom, appoint men in the province west of the \add Euphrates\add* River who will judge cases involving the people, and men who will judge cases involving the government. You must appoint men who know the laws of your God. All of you must teach God's laws to others who do not know them.
\v 26 Everyone who does not obey God's laws or the laws of my government must be punished severely. Some of them will be executed, some will be put in prison, some will be sent out of the country or have all their property taken away from them.

\v 25 So you, Ezra, with the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint judges and discerning men that will serve as judges for all the people that are beyond the River and 
all the ones who know the Law of your God, and that will teach the one who doesn’t know it.
\v 26 Then any who does not do the law of your God or the law of the king completely, execute judgment on them whether to kill, to banish, to confiscate treasures, or to imprison.”
