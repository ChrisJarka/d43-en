\v 1 
After five days, Ananias the chief priest, certain elders, and an orator named Tertullus, went there. These men brought charges against Paul to the governor.
\v 2 When Paul stood before the governor, Tertullus began to accuse him and said to the governor, “Because of you we have great peace; and your foresight brings good reform to our nation;
\p 
\v 3 so  with all thankfulness we welcome everything that you do, most excellent Felix.
1 After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul. 2 When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that prosperity is coming to this nation by your foresight, 3 we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. 4 But, that I don’t delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words. 5 For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. 6 He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.* 7  † 8  ‡By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.”
