\v 27 And as for you, the anointing which you received of him remains in you, and you need not that any one teach you; but as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you abide in him.
\v 28 And now, my little children, abide in him; that, if he shall be manifested, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
\v 29 If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one also that does righteousness is begotten of him.
