====== holy city ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible a holy city does not have any intrinsic holiness of it's own but was a place where either the temple and scriptures were kept, and as a result the worship of God was practiced.

  * In Jerusalem, the holy city there were copies of the law that were read on the Sabbath.
  * The holy men of the priesthood performed their practice from the holy city.
