==== Description ====

Imagery is language in which an image is paired with another idea so that the image represents the idea. This includes metaphors, similes, metonymies, and cultural models. Most metaphors, similes, and metonymies in a language or culture come from broad patterns of pairings between images and ideas, but some do not. These pages on Biblical Imagery tell about patterns of imagery in the Bible. To learn about pairings that do not fall into patterns, see [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]], and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]. 
[[Jim, at this point our pages on metaphor, simile and metonymy are not limited to ones that do not fall into patterns. Could I just delete the last sentence?]]

==== Metaphors and Similes ====

Most **metaphors** and **similes** in the Bible fall into broad patterns of associations between ideas: an image and the thing it is associated with. These patterns are often unique to the Hebrew and Greek languages. It is useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems on how to translate them. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere they see the same patterns.

See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part1]] for links to pages showing common patterns of associations between ideas in metaphors and similes.

==== Common Metonymies ====

In metonymy, a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. \\ 

See [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part2]] for a list of some common metonymies in the Bible.


==== Cultural Models ====
Cultural models can be described as systems of thought about things or experiences. As in metaphorical patterns and metonymies, an image is associated with another idea. But these systems of thought are more complex than metaphorical patterns and metonymies. [[I think we need to show what we mean by "more complex" or "more elaborate and more developed. ]] Some of these cultural models were used extensively by the cultures in the Ancient Near East, and not only by the Israelites. [[Whatever changes are made to this paragraph we will probably want to make on the Cultural Models page.]]

See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part3]] for a list of cultural models in the Bible.
