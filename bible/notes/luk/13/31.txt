\v 32 He replied to them, "Herod is \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as cruel as\add* a fox, \add but also as insignificant as a fox\add*. \add So I do not worry about him\add*. But \add to show him that no one can harm me until it is the time and place God has determined\add*, go tell him this \add message from me\add*: 'Listen! I am expelling demons and performing miracles today, and \add I will continue doing\add* it for a short time. After that, I will finish my work.
\v 33 But I must continue my trip \add to Jerusalem\add* during the coming days, because \add they killed many other\add* prophets there, and \add since I am also a prophet\add*, no other place is appropriate for people to kill \add me\add*.'"

\v 31 Shortly after, some Pharisee came and said to him, "Go and leave here because Herod wants to kill you."
\v 32 And he said, "Go and tell that fox, 'Look, I cast out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow, and then I am done."
\v 33 In any case, it is necessary for me to continue beyond today and tomorrow since it is not acceptable to kill a prophet outside Jerusalem *
