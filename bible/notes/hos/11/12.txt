Yahweh is talking about Israel and Judah.

  * **Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit** - This means that the people of Israel have continually lied and been dishonest with Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood** - AT: "Ephraim has constantly told lies to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **But Judah is still going about with me** - This means the people of the southern kingdom are still loyal to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
