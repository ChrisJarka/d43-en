====== Parallelism ======

===== Description =====

In **parallelism** two clauses that are similar in grammatical structure or idea are used together. Sometimes the two clauses mean basically the same thing. Sometimes the second clarifies the meaning of the first. Sometimes the second says something that contrasts with the first. 

Parallelism is most commonly found in poetry, proverbs, prophecy, and sermons. It also occurs in quoted speech in narratives. In poetry and prophecy especially, the parallel clauses often have other figures of speech and translations issues. For this reason, it is sometimes easier to write separate notes for the two clauses, and discuss the parallelism in the second clause.

===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.


=== Genesis 22:12 ===

"He said, "Do not lay your hand upon the lad, nor do anything to harm him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing that you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.""

  * **(1) Do not lay your hand upon the lad, nor do anything to harm him**  - **(3)**  Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. God made sure that Abraham would hear and understand him. **(4)** Alternate translation: "Do not hurt the boy in any way." **(5)**  (See: Parallelism)

=== Ruth 2:12 ===

"May Yahweh reward you for your deed. May you receive full payment from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have found refuge."

  * **(1) May you receive full payment from Yahweh**  - **(3)**  This is a poetic expression that is very similar to the previous sentence. **(4)** Alternate translation: "May Yahweh give back to you even more than you have given." **(5)** (See: Parallelism)



=== Matthew 10:27===

  * **What I tell you in the darkness, say in the daylight, and what you hear softly in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops** - This parallelism can also be translated as “Tell people in the daylight what I tell you in the darkness, and proclaim upon the housetops what you hear softly in your ear.” (See: Parallelism)

=== Matthew 13:13 ===

So I talk to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, neither do they understand. 

  * **because seeing they do not see** - "though they see, they do not see." The second use of "see" refers to understanding. Alternate translation: "Though they see things happen, they do not understand what those things mean." (See: metonymy)
  * **hearing they do not hear** -  "though they hear, they do not hear." The second use of "hear" refers to understanding. This part of the sentence means basically the same as the first. Jesus repeated this idea to emphasize that the crowds refused to understand. Alternate translation: "though they hear instruction, they do not understand the truth."  (See: Parallelism)


=== Luke 12:2 ===

"But there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known."

  * **There is nothing concealed that will not be revealed**  - This can be translated positively as "Everything that is hidden will be shown." It can be translated with active verbs as "People will find out about everything that people do secretly." (See: Active or Passive)
  * **and nothing hidden, that will not be made known**  - This part of the sentence says the same thing as the first part in order to emphasize the completeness of everything being made known. Alternate translation: "and everything that is hidden will be known" or "and people will know about everything that people hide." (See: Parallelism)
