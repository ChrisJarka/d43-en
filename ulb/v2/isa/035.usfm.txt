\c 35
\p
\v 1 The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
\v 2 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the
excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God.
\p
\v 3 Strengthen you the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
\v 4 Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come
with vengeance, with the recompense of God; he will come and save you.
\p
\v 5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
\v 6 Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break
out, and streams in the desert.
\v 7 And the glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water: in the habitation of jackals, where
they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.
\v 8 And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it;
but it shall be for the redeemed: the wayfaring men, yes fools, shall not err
therein.
\v 9 No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon; they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall
walk there:
\v 10 and the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads:
they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
