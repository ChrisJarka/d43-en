\v 3 He gave me this task because of the secret truth about which I wrote to you briefly;
\v 4 when you read what I have already written briefly about that, 
you will be able to understand that I clearly understand the truth about Christ.
\v 5 Formerly, God did not fully reveal the good news that was to come to anyone. It was something that no one understood, but now his Spirit has revealed the good news to his apostles and prophets whom the Spirit called to serve God.
