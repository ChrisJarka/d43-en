===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 15 God also said to Isaiah, \q These people have become unable to really listen to me; \q They have become unable to really hear what I say. \q It is as if they wanted to keep their eyes shut, \q As if they did not really want to see anything, \q As if they did not really want to hear anything. \q They are like this so they will not think they must stop sinning; \q They are like this so they will not think they need for me to save them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to sit in a boat near the beach and tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * This verse concludes the prophecy from Isaiah that started in verse 14. It uses parallelism to emphasize the truths being taught. (See: Parallelism)
  * **this people's heart has become dull **- This can be translated "the hearts of these people have become dull" (see UDB).
  * **their ears are heavy of hearing**  - This can be translated "their ears hear with difficulty" (see UDB).
  * **their eyes they have closed **- "they have closed their eyes"
  * **Lest they should perhaps perceive with their eyes, Hear with their ears, Understand with their heart, And should turn again **- "So that they will not be able to see with their eyes, hear with their ears, or understand with their heart and as a result turn back"
  * **turn again**  - "turn back" or "repent"
  * **And I should heal them**  - "And then I would heal them." This quote from Isaiah is referring to God healing the unbelief of the nation of Israel. Jesus is referring to the crowd's unbelief. This refers to spiritual healing, not physical healing.
