\v 14 Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to God, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh:
\q In that day when my people Israel dwells securely, will you not know it?
\q
\v 15 Yet you go from your place far away to the north along with a great people,
\q all of them riding on horses, a great company and a large army?
\q
\v 16 And you go up against my people Israel like cloud to cover the land?
\q It will be in the latter days I will bring you against my land
\q So that the nations might know me when I sanctify you before their eyes, Gog.’
