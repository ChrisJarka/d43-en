====== Colossians 01:15-17 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 God's Son reveals perfectly what God, his Father, is like, whom no one can see. God's Son existed before and ranks above everything that God has created.
\v 16 When God created everything that is on the earth, he did it by having his Son do it. He created everything that \add people\add* can see, and also everything which is in heaven that \add people\add* cannot see. In particular, his Son created all ranks of important spirit beings. \add And he ranks above everything\add*, because God created everything by the work of his Son, and because by him all things were created \f + \ft Or:because \add God\add* created everything \f* in order that everything might praise his Son,
\v 17 and because it is his Son who existed before anything else existed, and because God sustains everything by what his Son \add does\add*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 When we know the Son, we know what God is like, even though we cannot see him. The Son has first place over everything that he has created.
\v 16 For the Son created all things, as the Father desired him to--everything in the sky and everything on earth, everything that we can see and everything that we cannot see, such as angelic beings of all kinds and powers and authorities--all things exist because the Son created them because the Father wanted him to. And they exist for him.
\v 17 The Son himself existed before anything else, and he holds everything together.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 The Son is the image of the invisible God. He is the firstborn of all creation
\v 16 because by him all things were created, those in the heavens and those on the earth, the visible and the invisible things. Whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities, all things were created by him and for him.
\v 17 He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
