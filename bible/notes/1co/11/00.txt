====== 1 Corinthians 11 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This is the beginning of a new section of the letter (Chapters 11-14). Paul will now talk about what is proper in church services. In chapter 11 he deals with two different problems: women in the church services (11:1-16) and the Lord’s Supper (11:17-34).

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

**Proper conduct in a church service**

Paul was happy that they were doing just what he had told them to do. 

In 11:1-16 Paul says Christ is the head of every man and men are the head of women. Men should not cover their head when praying or prophesying out of respect for Christ.  But women should cover their heads when they pray or prophesy. to show respect to their husbands and the angels. 

11:17-34
Background: In those days communion services were not just a small piece of bread and a sip of wine. They were a large meal where everyone who could, brought food for everyone else to eat. At the end of the meal they had one last piece of bread and one last drink of wine.
There were problems in how they were handling the Lord’s Supper. They were not unified but were divided into disagreeing groups. Some ate their own food without sharing and some got drunk while some of the poor people went hungry.

Then Paul told how Christ ran the Last Supper just before he was arrested, as a remembrance of his death. If someone eats in a bad way, without remembering Christ’s death, he will be punished. Some were already sick and some had died. People need to judge themselves so that God will not have to judge them. 


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

**Rhetorical questions**

Paul uses [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] to scold the people for their unwillingness to follow the rules for worship that he has suggested.

**Metonymy**

He uses two [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]s “the head” for the one in charge.  “The cup” for the wine in the cup.

**Metaphor**

He uses two [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]s “the bread” for his body.  “the cup” for his blood.

**Irony**

He scolds the people with [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]]: “For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may be recognized among you.” Paul is quoting what he thinks they wrongly believe.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

**The reason for a woman covering her head when prophesying or praying**

This is why the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels - There are two ways of interpreting this sentence:

1.	A woman should cover her head when she prays or prophesizes to honor her husband and the angels.

2. 	A woman should cover her head when she prays or prophesizes as a sign to the angles of her authority to speak to and for God.
