\v 22 nevertheless, God our Father has now reconciled you \add to himself. He did that\add* as a result of his Son dying physically. He did it in order that you should be completely holy when he brings you into his presence.
\v 23 But he wants you to continue \f + \ft doublet \f* to believe the message about Christ; specifically, he wants you to continue to be stable\f + \ft Or: steadfast \f* and to continue to confidently expect to receive that which you heard about when you heard that message.

\v 21 Before you believed God considered you his enemies, and you were formerly hostile to God because you thought evil thoughts and because you did evil deeds.
\v 22 But now God has reconciled you to himself 
and has made you his friends. Jesus did this when he gave his human body and life for us by his death on the cross. His death sets us apart for God and completely forgives all our sin against God. Now we can enter his presence because Jesus has forgiven us.
\v 23 You must continue trusting Christ to be firmly established, like a building built on solid rock. Do not let anything move you away from the confident expectations God has given in the message of the Good News which you  heard. Believers are trying to proclaim the Good News to everyone in the world, to everyone under the sky, the same Good News for which I Paul an now a servant.

\v 21 And you also, at one time, were strangers from God and were his enemies in your mind and by your evil deeds.
\v 22 Yet now God has reconciled you in the body of Christ's flesh through death, in order to present you holy, blameless, and unreproveable before himself.
\v 23 This is providing that you continue grounded and settled in the faith and are not moved away from the confidence of the gospel that you heard and that was proclaimed in all the creation under heaven, the gospel that I, Paul, became a servant.
