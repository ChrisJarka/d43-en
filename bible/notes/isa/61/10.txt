\p
\v 10 I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of
salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with a garland, and as a bride
adorneth herself with her jewels.
\v 11 For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the
Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
