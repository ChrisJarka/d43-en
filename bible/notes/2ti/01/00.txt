====== 2 Timothy 01 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Spiritual children ==

Paul calls Timothy his "son." Paul was very involved in [[:en:obe:kt:disciple|discipling]] Timothy. Therefore, he called him his "[[:en:obe:kt:spiritual|spiritual]]" son.


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Persecution ==
Both Paul and Timothy were suffering persecution when this letter was written. Paul takes the time to encourage Timothy in the midst of these difficulties. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
