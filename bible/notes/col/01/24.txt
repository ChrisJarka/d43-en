\v 24 At the present time I am rejoicing that I am suffering for your benefit; that is, I am completing what Christ \add decided\add* that I should suffer physically for the benefit of all believers, \add who are as dear to him as\add* his own body.
\v 25 I myself became one who serves God's people, because I was appointed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* appointed me \f* to be responsible to \add help\add* you \add who are non-Jews\add*. I became one who serves God's people in order that I should make known to you non-Jews the whole message from, Or: about God.
\v 26 \add We did not know this message previously; that is, God\add* concealed it from \add the people who lived in all\add* the previous ages, but he has now revealed it to his people.
\v 27 That is, God decided to reveal to them this message, which declares that he will greatly bless the non-Jews. Specifically, this message declares that Christ, \add by his Spirit\add*, will live in you who are non-Jews, with the result that you confidently expect that you will share in \add God's\add* glory.

\v 24 Now I rejoice that I am suffering for your benefit. For you, that is for Christ's Ekklesia, his believers from across the world, which is also called "the Body of Christ," I am completing the details of Christ's sufferings, which are the sufferings needed to spread the Good News to the world.
\v 25 God made me his servant and gave to me the special responsibility in his plan to fullfill his message, which is to take the Good News to non Jewish peoples like you.
\v 26 This message of the Good News has been a mystery that has been hidden from ancient times, for generations, but now God has revealed this mystery to those set apart for him.
\v 27 God's plan was to reveal the glorious riches in this mystery among the non Jews instead of the Jews. And this mystery has been this: Christ living in you non Jews and leading you to confidently expect to share in God's glory.
