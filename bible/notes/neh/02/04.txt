\v 4 Then the king said to me, For what do you make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
\v 5 And I said to the king, If it please the king, and if your servant have found favor in your sight, that you would send
me to Judah, to the city of my fathersâ€™ sepulchres, that I may build it.
\v 6 And the king said to me (the queen also sitting by him), For how long shall your journey be? and when will you return?
So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
