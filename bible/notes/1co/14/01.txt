<usfm>
\v 1 You must want to love others more \add than you want anything else\add*. But you should \add also\add* eagerly desire the abilities that \add God's\add* Spirit \add gives to believers\add*. And you should desire most of all to have the ability to speak messages that come directly from God \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 2-3 \add I say that\add* because those who speak messages that come directly from God \add are speaking in languages that they and the other believers in the congregation know, and thus\add* they are able to strengthen them \add spiritually\add* and to encourage and comfort them. But those who speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add* are not speaking to people. Instead, they are \add only\add* speaking to God. No one understands them. By \add the power\f + \ft Or: guidance \f* of God's\add* Spirit \f + \ft Or: From within \add their own\add* spirit \f* they speak things that others do not know.
\v 4 Those who speak in languages \add that they have not learned\add* are receiving a blessing for themselves, but those who speak messages that come directly from God are giving a blessing to \add all the believers in\add* the congregation \add because they are speaking in a language that the congregation knows\add*.

\v 1 It is love that you must run after, and be earnest in your desire for the spiritual gifts. Prophecy, among all the gifts, is the most useful for building up the body of Christ.
\v 2 When a person speaks in an spiritual language, he is not speaking to people, because no one can understand him, but he is speaking to God. He is speaking in a mysterious way, as the Spirit leads him, but people cannot understand what he is saying.
\v 3 The one who proclaims the word of God in this kind of prophecy does speak directly to people. This is taking the word of God and building up those who hear, and encouraging them by telling them all the wonderful promises and wonders in God's word.
\v 4 The one who speaks in an spiritual language may build himself up, but the one who proclaims the word of God in prophecy, benefits everyone in the church and build it up in every way.

\v 1 Pursue love and be zealous for spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.
\v 2 For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, for no man understands him because he speaks mysteries in the Spirit, 
\v 3 But the one who prophesies speaks to people, to build them up, to encourage them, and to comfort them. 
\v 4 He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.
