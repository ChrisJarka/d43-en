\v 12 Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has
greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;
\v 13 therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and
I will make it desolate from Teman; even to Dedan shall they fall by the sword.
