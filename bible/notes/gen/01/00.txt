====== General notes about Genesis 1 ======

**Formatting in this chapter**\\

This chapter presents the first account of God creating the world. There is a pattern to this account: "God said...God saw that it was good...This was evening and morning, the first day." Translators should preserve this pattern in their versions.

**Special concepts in this chapter**\\

This account of creation is told in the framework of the ancient Hebrew ideas of what the universe was like: the earth was resting with water around it and below it. Over the earth was something like a vast dome, called "an expanse between the waters" (1:6), on top of which was more water. Translations should represent these ideas as closely as possible, even if their readers have a different understanding of how the universe is structured.

**Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter**\\

The commands of God, "Let there be..." can be difficult to translate, because God is speaking to things, not to people. Also, he is speaking to things are do not yet exist. If an exact translation is not understandable to the readers, then translators may have adjust the language. For example, they may write, "I wish that..." or even "Now I will make...."
