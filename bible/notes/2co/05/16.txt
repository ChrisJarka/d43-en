\v 16 So, \add because I realize how much Christ loves all people\add*, I no longer think about people in the way that those who do not believe \add in Christ\add* think about \add them\add*. Before I \add was a believer\add*, I thought about Christ in the way that other non-believers did. But I do not think of him that way anymore.
\v 17 The fact is that God makes every one \add of us\add* who \add trusts\add* in Christ to be completely different \add than we were before\add*. Our old \add way of conducting our lives\add* is gone. We now have a \add completely\add* new way of \add conducting our lives\add*.

\v 16 From now on, then, we do not know any man from a human point of view; even though we once knew Christ as a human, we no longer know him that way.
\v 17 So if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature, The old things have gone away; behold, they are now new.
