\v 1 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites
were appointed,
\v 2 that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man,
and feared God above many.
\v 3 And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand
on guard, let them shut the doors, and bar you them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in
his watch, and every one to be over against his house.
\v 4 Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.
\p
\v 5 And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by
genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first, and I found written therein:
\v 6 These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and that returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his city;
\v 7 who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum,
Baanah.
\p The number of the men of the people of Israel:
\v 8 The children of Parosh, two thousand a hundred and seventy and two.
\v 9 The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.
\v 10 The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two.

\v 36 The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.
\v 37 The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and one.
\v 38 The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.
\p
\v 39 The priests: The children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and three.
\v 40 The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.
\v 41 The children of Pashhur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven.
\v 42 The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.
\p
\v 43 The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, of the children of Hodevah, seventy and four.
\v 44 The singers: the children of Asaph, a hundred forty and eight.
\v 45 The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children
of Hatita, the children of Shobai, a hundred thirty and eight.
\p
\v 46 The Nethinim: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth,
\v 47 the children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of Padon,
\v 48 the children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of Salmai,
\v 49 the children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar,
\v 50 the children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda,
\v 51 the children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Paseah.
\v 52 The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephushesim,
\v 53 the children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur,
\v 54 the children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha,
\v 55 the children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Temah,
\v 56 the children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.
\p
\v 57 The children of Solomon’s servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,
\v 58 the children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,
\v 59 the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Amon.
\v 60 All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon’s servants, were three hundred ninety and two.
\p
\v 61 And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not show their
fathers’ houses, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel:
\v 62 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.
\v 63 And of the priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the
daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.
\v 64 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were
they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.
\v 65 And the governor said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim
and Thummim.
\p
\v 66 The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,
\v 67 besides their male servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and
they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.
\v 68 Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;
\v 69 their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their
asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
\p
\v 70 And some from among the heads of fathers’ houses gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury a
thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests’ garments.
\v 71 And some of the heads of fathers’ houses gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and
two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver.
\v 72 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and
threescore and seven priests’ garments.
\p
\v 73 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all
Israel, lived in their cities.
\p And when the seventh month was come, the children of Israel were in their cities.
