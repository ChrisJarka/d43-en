\v 5 The waters closed over me to take my life;
\q the deep was all around me;
\q seaweed was wrapped around my head.
\q
\v 6 I went down to the bases of the mountains;

===== Translation Notes: =====

  This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in Jonah 2:2.
  
  * **seaweed** - "grass that grows in the sea"
  * **the deep was all around me** - "the deep water was all around me"
  * **The earth with its bars closed upon me for ever **- "I had the feeling I would be in a prison inside the earth forever" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **Yet you brought up my life from the pit **  - "But, you saved my life from the place of the dead" or "you saved me from the place where the dead people are"
  * **O Yahweh, my God!**  - Jonah used the name of the one he is praying to in order to  show him respect. In some languages it is more natural to put this in some other place in the prayer. Put it where it sounds best in your language.
