\v 11 We greatly desire each of you to continue to fully expect to receive what God has provided for you, until you finally receive everything from him.
\v 12 I do not want you to be lazy. Instead, I want you to do what other believers have done, those who are receiving what God promised them, because they trusted in him and were patient.
