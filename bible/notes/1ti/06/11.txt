\v 11 But you, man of God, flee from these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, endurance, and gentleness.
\v 12 Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of the everlasting life to which you were called. It was about this that you gave witness before many witnesses as to what is good.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **man of God** - "servant of God" or "person who belongs to God"
  * **flee from these things** - Paul speaks of these temptations and sins as if they were things that a person could physically run away from: AT: "treat these things like creatures who want to harm you." Possible meanings of "these things" are 1) the "love of money" (UDB) or 2) the different teachings, pride, arguments, and the love of money. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Pursue** - Paul speaks of righteousness and other good qualities as if they were things that a person could run after. AT: "Run after" or "Chase" or "Do your best to act in" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Fight the good fight...Take hold of...life** - Paul may be speaking of the challenge to trust and obey Christ as if it were a battle in warfare. Or he may be speaking of it as if it were a sports competition in which the winner of the "fight" can "take hold of" or receive a prize. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **gave witness** - "gave testimony" or "testified"
  * **before many witnesses* - The idea of location is used to signal the idea of addressees. AT: "to many witnesses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
