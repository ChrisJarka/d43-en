====== reveal, revelation ======

===== Definition: =====

To reveal something is to cause it to be seen or known. A revelation is revealed or disclosed information.

  * Jesus revealed himself, meaning Jesus appeared to Paul and spoke to him audibly. This is the same thing that John experienced as recorded in the book of Revelation.
  * God's general revelation refers to God showing that He exists as seen in his creation of the world and everything in it.
