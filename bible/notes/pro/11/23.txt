====== Proverbs 11:23-24 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 23 When the things that righteous people want happen, it brings good \add to them and to others\add*, \q2 but when the wicked get what they want, it causes everyone else to become angry. \b \q1 \v 24 Some people give their money generously to poor people, but they become richer \add in spite of that\add*, \q2 and some people hold tightly to their money, but they still become poor \add in spite of that\add*. \b \q1 </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 23 The single desire of those who do right, is the good. \q2 but reward of the wicked is, in the future, they will experience God's wrath. \q1 \v 24 If a person sows seed, he can expect to harvest a crop; \q1 his few seeds will give him much more; \q1 another person does not plant a crop, and he becomes poor.

\q1 </usfm>
