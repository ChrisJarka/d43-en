  * **against my shepherd** - This refer to a certain king or a certain servant of Yahweh.
  * **this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:zec:01:01|1:3]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh of host has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh of hosts, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **the flock** - "The flock" refers to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
