\v 8 But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.
\v 9 There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of
the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skillful men.
\v 10 But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the
nations are not able to abide his indignation.
