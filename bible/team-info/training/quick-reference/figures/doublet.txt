====== Doublet ======


===== Description =====

In a **doublet** two words or two short phrases that mean basically the same thing are used together–-typically, as a way to reinforce the concept. The two words are often joined with "and."  In the Bible, doublets are often used in poetry, prophecy, and sermons.

Note: We are using the term **doublets** for __words or short phrases__ that mean basically the same thing and are used together. We are using the term **parallelism** for __clauses or longer phrases__ that are similar in grammatical structure or idea are used together.

===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.

=== Isaiah 6:1 === 
"In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a high and elevated throne, and the hem of his robe filled the temple."

  * **(1) on a high and elevated throne** - **(3)** The words “high” and “elevated” mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. The height of the throne emphasizes the supreme authority and holiness of the Lord. **(4)** Alternate translation: “on a throne that was raised up very high” **(5)** (See: Doublet)

===Ezekiel 21:31===
"I will pour out my indignation on you! I will fan the fire of my rage against you and put you into the hand of cruel men, craftsmen of destruction!"

  * **(1) cruel men, craftsmen of destruction** - **(2)** "cruel men, men who are skilled at destroying others." **(3)** Here God says the same thing in two ways to emphasize how cruel these men were. **(4)** Alternate translation: "very cruel and destructive men." **(5)** (See: Doublet)

=== Luke 1:71 ===

"He promised to provide for us salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of everyone who hates us."

  * **(1) enemies…everyone who hates us**  - **(3)**  These two phrases  both refer to those who are against God's people. **(4)** Alternate translation: "people who fight against us and want to harm us." **(5)**  (See: Doublet)

===Philippians 1:20===

"It is my confident expectation and certainty that I will not be ashamed."

  * **(1) It is my confident expectation and hope** - **(3)** This says the same thing in two different ways to emphasize how sure Paul is that he is living in a way that honors Christ. **(4)** Alternate translation: “I certainly believe.” **(5)** (See: Doublet)

=== 2 Thessalonians 1:4 ===

"So we ourselves speak proudly about you among the churches of God concerning your patience and faith in all your persecutions and afflictions that you endure. "

  * **(1) your persecutions and afflictions**  - **(3)**  This says the same thing in different ways to emphasize the how badly they were being treated by their enemies. **(4)** Alternate translation: "your severe persecutions." **(5)**  (See: Doublet)
