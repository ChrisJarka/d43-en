\v 4 Now consider how great this man was, to whom our father Abraham gave a tenth out of the best goods that he had taken.
\v 5 And indeed, the descendants of Levi who receive the priestâ€™s office have a command to collect  tithes according to the law from the people, that is, from their brothers, even though they, too, come from Abraham's loins.
\v 6 But Melchizedek, who is not a descendant from Levi, received tithes from  Abraham, and blessed him, the one having the promises.
