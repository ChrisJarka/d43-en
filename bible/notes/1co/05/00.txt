=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

This chapter deals with sexual immorality of one church member.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

Euphonium (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]]): “sleep with” meaning have sex with.
 Metonymy (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]): “in the name of the Lord” meaning with Christ’s power. 

Idiom (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]): the day of the Lord means when Christ returns to earth. 
Metaphor (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]): He uses an extensive comparison using many metaphors. Yeast represents evil. The loaf represents the whole congregation. The unleavened bread represents a pure life. The Passover represents the Christian life. So the whole passage means: Don’t you know that a little evil will affect the whole congregation. So clean yourselves from evil so you will all be good. Christ has been sacrificed for us; so let us be sincere and truthful and not wicked and behaving badly.
Rhetorical questions (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
