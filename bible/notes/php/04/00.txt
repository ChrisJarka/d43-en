=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Paul considered the Philippians spiritually maturity an important achievement that he helped to achieve. He take pride in discipling other Christians and spurring them on in spirtual growth to be an important part of the Christian life. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Euodia and Syntyche ==
Apparently, there was a disagreement between these two women and Paul was encouraging unity and harmony between them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
