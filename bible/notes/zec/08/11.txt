\q
\v 11 But now it will not be as in former days,
\q I will be with the remnant of this people
\q â€”this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts.
\q
\v 12 For seeds of peace will be sown;
\q the climbing vine will give its fruit and the earth will give its produce;
\q the skies will give their dew,
\q for I will make the remnant of this people inherit all these things.
