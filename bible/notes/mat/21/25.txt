\v 25 Where did John the Baptizer get his authority to baptize those who came to him? Did he get it from God or from people?' The chief priests and elders debated among themselves about what they should answer. They said to each other, “If we say, ‘It was  from God’, he will say to us, ‘Then you should have believed his message!
\v 26 If we say, 'It was from people', we are afraid that the crowd will react violently, because all the people believe that John was a prophet sent by God."
\v 27 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know where John got his authority." Then he said to them, "Because you did not answer my question, I will not tell you who authorized me to do the things I did here yesterday."

\v 25 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?
\v 26 But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.
\v 27 And they answered Jesus, and said, We know not. He also said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
things.
