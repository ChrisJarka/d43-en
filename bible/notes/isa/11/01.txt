===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **A shoot will sprout from the root of Jesse, and a branch out of his root will bear fruit** - This compares the total destruction of Assyria with Israel who was also beaten down, but who will once again grow and be fruitful. This speaks of the coming Messiah who will come from the line of Jesse and David. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **The Spirit of Yahweh will rest upon him** - Here "him" refers to the Messiah who is to come.
