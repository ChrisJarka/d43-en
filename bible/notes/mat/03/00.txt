== Is Near ==

This phrase can have great theological significance. Scholars often debate whether the "kingdom of heaven" was present at this time or still coming. English translations frequently use the phrase "at hand" but this can create difficulty in translating its meaning properly. Other translations use the phase "is drawing near" and "has come near."
