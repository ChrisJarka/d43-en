\c 9
\p
\v 1 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
\v 2 for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year
past; and your zeal has stirred up very many of them.
\v 3 But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said,
you may be prepared:
\v 4 lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put
to shame in this confidence.
\v 5 I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before to you, and make up beforehand your
aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion.
\p
\v 6 But this I say, He that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that sows bountifully shall reap
also bountifully.
\v 7 Let each man do according as he has purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God
loves a cheerful giver.
\v 8 And God is able to make all grace abound to you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound to
every good work:
\v 9 as it is written,
\q He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor;
\q His righteousness remains for ever.
\m
\v 10 And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase
the fruits of your righteousness:
\v 11 you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.
\v 12 For the ministration of this service not only fills up the measure of the wants of the saints, but abounds also
through many thanksgivings to God;
\v 13 seeing that through the proving of you by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your
confession to the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;
\v 14 while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in
you.
\v 15 Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.
