====== Ecclesiastes 08:16-17 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 I thought about being wise and about people who work very hard on this earth, working day and night and not taking time to sleep.
\v 17 Then I thought about everything \f + \ft hyperbole \f* that God has done, and I realized that no one can understand everything that happens here on this earth. Truly, people are not able to fully understand everything \add that God does\add*, even if they try hard to do that. Even if wise people claim that they understand it all, they cannot.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes),
\v 17 then I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun:.Because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yes moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.
