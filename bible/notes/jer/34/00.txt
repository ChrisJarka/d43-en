====== Jeremiah 34 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===
== Law of Moses ==
According to the law of Moses, the people were required to free their indebted slaves after a period of time. The king led them in freeing their fellow Israelites whom they held as slaves, but later they changed their minds and enslaved them again. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses]] and [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Actions with cultural meaning ==

When the people of Israel made a sacred promise to God, they cut a calf in two and passed between its parts. It was a very serious sin not to do what one had promised. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:promise]], [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
