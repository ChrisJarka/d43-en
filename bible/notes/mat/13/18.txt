\v 18 Now listen to me explain the parable I told you.
\v 19 Some people hear about how God is starting to rule over people's lives but do not understand it. They are like the path where some of the seeds fell. Satan, the evil one, comes and causes these people to forget what they have heard.

sown on the wayside.
