====== magic, magician ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible this term refers to pagan practices of divination.

  * Pagan magicians or diviners would use methods such as examining the entrails of an animal, or throwing animal bones on the ground to observe what pattern they have when they hit the ground.
  * Magicians or diviners interpret these patterns as a sign or a guidance from their pagan diety. God forbids all such practices for his people since these lead to superstitions and not obedience to His word.
