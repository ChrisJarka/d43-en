\c 3

\v 1 And Jehovah said to me, Go again, love a woman beloved of
her friend, and an adulteress, even as Jehovah loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and
love cakes of raisins.
\v 2 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;
\v 3 and I said to her, You shall abide for me many days; you shall not play the harlot, and you shall not be any manâ€™s
wife: so will I also be toward thee.
\v 4 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without
pillar, and without ephod or teraphim:
\v 5 afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king, and shall come with fear
to Jehovah and to his goodness in the latter days.
