===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men?**- Even though Jesus knew the answer to this question, he asked it to test the religious leaders reasons for questioning him. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:rhetorical-question]])
  * **The baptism of John**  - The phrase "The baptism of John" refers to John baptizing people who came to to him wanting forgiveness of sins.  He used baptism in water to show they were clean before God.  It was as if the person they had been had died under the water and they were raised out of the water as a new person.
  * **was it from heaven or from men**  - This is asking if God gave the idea to John or if he developed it by himself.
