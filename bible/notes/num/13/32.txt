\v 32 So they spread around a gloomy report to the descendants of Israel about the land they had looked over. They said, "The land which we have gone to look over is a land that eats up its inhabitants. All the people whom we saw there are men of great stature.
\v 33 There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who descend from the Nephilim. We were in our own sight like grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight, too."
