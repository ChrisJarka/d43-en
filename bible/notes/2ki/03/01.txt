\v 1 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
\v 2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
\v 3 Nevertheless he cleaved to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
