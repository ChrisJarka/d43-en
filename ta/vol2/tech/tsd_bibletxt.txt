===== The Process for Translating the Bible =====

This module answers the question: //What steps do I follow when I translate the Bible into the target language?//

Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * //[[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_intro|translationStudio-Desktop Introduction]]//
  * //[[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_install|translationStudio-Desktop v7 Installation]]//

A basic translation process for any unfoldingWord project is explained here.
 
Note: the recommendations of the Forum of Bible Agencies (see http://www.forum-intl.org/resources ) is a helpful reference in the translation of any theological text.
 
==== Translating the Text ====
 
As you translate, be sure that you:
  * pray that God would help you make an easily-understandable, Scripturally-accurate translation
  * translate everything that is in the source language
  * do not add anything that that is not necessary for comprehension
  * always do your translation according to the Translation Guidelines (see [[:en:ta:vol1:intro:translation_guidelines]])
  * always do your translation according to the Statement of Faith (see [[:en:ta:vol1:intro:statement_of_faith]])
  * use the translationNotes, the translationWords, the translationQuestions, and the Unlocked Dynamic Bible  to help you make a better translation

==== Create Translation Text ====

**Note:** "Source Language" refers to the language from which the translation is being done. "Target Language" refers to the language into which the translation is being done.''

To write the translation in your language: 
  * Go to the story or book that is being translated.
  * In the **Chapter or Story** view, read the source text.
  * Click on the **Chunk** view to begin translating.
**Note:** The program is designed for using the process of blind drafting. You may want to read [[en:ta:vol1:translate:mast]] to understand the steps of blind drafting translation.
  * Click on the paper that is showing to the right of the source text chunk. Type in the translation for that chunk on the page. (Note the reference at the top of the chunk, just above the red line.)
    * Start translating using the blind draft process - Draft the chunk as well as you can without looking back at the text. Write everything that you remember about that chunk. Do not look back at the source text for this chunk until you begin the editing steps. Continue doing this with each chunk of the chapter before moving to the checking steps.
  * When you are finished working, click on or scroll to a different chunk.

==== Edit Translation Text ====

When you use translationStudio, you have the ability to create and change text. Use the **Chunk** or **Check** views to edit existing work that you or another translator created. Your work will be saved automatically every five minutes.

In the **Check** view the source text is on the left, the translation work is in the middle. If necessary, scroll from the left to the right side to show the resources for that chunk. Scroll up or down to move from chunk to chunk. The UDB and all of the translationNotes, translationWords and translationQuestions have been included in the translation helps. See [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_resources]] for more information.

After the translation has been thoroughly checked, move the verse markers to where they should be in the text. The verse markers are shaped like upside-down blue water droplets.

When you are finished working, use the slider at the bottom of the chunk to mark the translation of that chunk done. A message will appear for you to confirm that the chunk is done. Tap 'Confirm' to confirm that the work is done or 'Cancel' to continue working on the chunk.

==== Save Translation Text ====

Go to [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_backup]] to learn how to manually save the translation work to the computer.

Your work is not saved on unfoldingWord until you upload your work. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_d43publish]])

==== Delete Translation Text ====

If you accidentally delete a large amount of work, contact [[help@door43.org]].
