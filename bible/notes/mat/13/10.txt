\v 10 The disciples came and said to Jesus, "Why do you talk to the crowd in parables?"
\v 11 Jesus answered and said to them, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
is not given.
\v 12 For whoever has anything, to him will more be given, and he will have a great deal. But whoever has nothing, from him will be taken
away even what he has.
