\v 23 How can you say, I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baalim? see your way in the valley, know what you have
done: you are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
\v 24 a wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind in her desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? all
they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
\v 25 Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst. But you saidst, It is in vain; no, for I have loved
strangers, and after them will I go.
