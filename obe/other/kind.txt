====== kind, kinds ======

===== Definition: =====

When "kind" is a noun, it refers to a group or classification of things that are connected by shared characteristics.

  * A group or classification of plants or animals that share characteristics is called a "kind".
  * The main thing that distinguishes each "kind" as a separate group is that members of that group can reproduce more of their same "kind".
  * Often there are many different variations or species within each "kind." For example, horses, zebras, and donkeys are all members of the same "kind," but they are different species.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * This term could be translated as "type" or "class" or "group" or "category."
  * The word "species" would //not// be an accurate translation of this term, since "kind" is a broader category with several species within it.

[Note: This term is not the word that is related to kindness.]
