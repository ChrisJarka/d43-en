\c 59
\d For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm
of David. Michtam; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.
\q
\v 1 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God:
\q Set me on high from them that rise up against me.
\q
\v 2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
\q And save me from the bloodthirsty men.
\q
\v 3 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul;
\q The mighty gather themselves together against me:
\q Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Jehovah.
\q
\v 4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault:
\q Awake you to help me, and behold.
\q
\v 5 Even thou, O Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel,
\q Arise to visit all the nations:
\q Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 They return at evening, they howl like a dog,
\q And go round about the city.
\q
\v 7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth;
\q Swords are in their lips:
\q For who, say they, does hear?
\q
\v 8 But thou, O Jehovah, will laugh at them;
\q You will have all the nations in derision.
\q
\v 9 Because of his strength I will give heed to thee;
\q For God is my high tower.
\q
\v 10 My God with his lovingkindness will meet me:
\q God will let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
\q
\v 11 Slay them not, lest my people forget:
\q Scatter them by your power, and bring them down,
\q O Lord our shield.
\q
\v 12 For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,
\q Let them even be taken in their pride,
\q And for cursing and lying which they speak.
\q
\v 13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they shall be no more:
\q And let them know that God rules in Jacob,
\q To the ends of the earth. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 14 And at evening let them return, let them howl like a dog,
\q And go round about the city.
\q
\v 15 They shall wander up and down for food,
\q And wait all night if they be not satisfied.
\q
\v 16 But I will sing of your strength;
\q Yea, I will sing aloud of your lovingkindness in the morning:
\q For you have been my high tower,
\q And a refuge in the day of my distress.
\q
\v 17 To thee, O my strength, will I sing praises:
\q For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
