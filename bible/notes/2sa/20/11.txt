\v 11 And there stood by him one of Joabâ€™s young men, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow
Joab.
\v 12 And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still,
he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him
stood still.
\v 13 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
