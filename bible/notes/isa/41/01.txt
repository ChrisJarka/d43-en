\v 1 "Listen before me in silence, you coastlands; let the nations renew their strength;
\q1 let them come near and speak; let us come near together to argue a dispute.

\v 2 Who stirred up this one from the east? Who calls him in good order to his foot?
\q1 He hands nations over to him and makes him able to subdue kings;
\q1 he makes them like the dust with his sword, like windblown stubble with his bow.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Listen before me in silence** - Here "me" refers to God.
  * **you coastlands** - This refers to the people who live on the islands and in the lands bordering or beyond the Mediterranean Sea. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **renew their strength** - Translate this phrase in the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:40:29|40:31]].
  * **let them come near and speak; let us come near together to argue a dispute** - These two phrases share similar meanings. The second explains the reason for the first. AT: "then let them come near so they may speak and reason with me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Who stirred up this one from the east? Who calls him in good order to his foot?** - Yahweh uses questions to emphasize that he is the one who caused this ruler from the east to be victorious. AT: "I am the one who called this powerful ruler from the east and put him in my good service." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to his foot** - To be at one's foot was to be in that person's service. AT: "to his service" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **He hands nations over to him** - "I give the nations over to him" or "The one who does these things hands nations over to him"
  * **he makes them like the dust with his sword, like windblown stubble with his bow** - The nations whom the one from the east will conquer are compared to dust and stubble, both because they will become very small like those things and because his army will scatter them easily. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
