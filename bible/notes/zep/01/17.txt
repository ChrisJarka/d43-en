\v 17 For I will bring distress upon mankind, so they shall walk about like blind men since they have sinned against Yahweh! Their blood shall be poured out like dust,
and their innards like dung!
\v 18 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them in the day of Yahweh's fury! The fire of Yahweh's wrath will consume the whole land, for the annihilation that
he will bring against all the inhabitants of the land will be terrible!
