\v 25 I will cause the king of Babylon to become stronger and stronger, and the king of Egypt to become completely weak. When that happens, when I make the Babylonian army strong, they will use that power to attack Egypt.
\v 26 I will scatter the people of Egypt among the nations. And when that happens, people will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.

\v 25 For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, while  Pharaoh's arm will fall. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I put my sword into  the hand of the king of Babylon; for he will strike the land of Egypt with it.
\v 26 So I will scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them through the lands. Then they will know that I am Yahweh!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon** – "I will make the arms of the king of Babylon strong." The word "arms" is a metaphor for power. Alternate translation: "I will give power to the king of Babylon." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **while Pharaoh's arm will fall** – "but Pharaoh will not be able to use his arms." Yahweh will take away all of Pharaoh's power.
  * **Then they** – The word "they" possibly refers to 1) "the Egyptian" or 2) "all people who hear what Yahweh has done."
  * **know that I am Yahweh** – See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]].
  * **set my sword in the hand of**- "give power to"
  * **strike**  - attack
