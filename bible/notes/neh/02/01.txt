\v 1 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I
took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.
\v 2 And the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heare.
Then I was very sore afraid.
