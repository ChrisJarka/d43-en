===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:yahweh]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:stronghold]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:refuge]]

  * [[:en:obe:kt:darkness]]

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **a stronghold in the day of trouble** - Yahweh is compared to a place built to protect people from their enemies called a stronghold. The phrase "day of trouble" refers to when the enemy attacks.  Alternate translation: "a place of safety when bad things happen" (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]]) 
    * **with an overwhelming flood** - The word "overwhelming" means something is completely covered in water.  So an "overwhelming flood" is a flood of water that completely covers over everything.  Nahum compares Yahweh's victory over his enemies to a flood to mean the victory will be complete and his enemies will be helpless.
    * **pursue them into darkness**  - Darkness refers to a place where nothing can be seen. Alternate translation:  "chase after them and they will no longer be seen." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
