\v 10 And the young men that were grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you say to the people that spoke to
thee, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus shall you say to them, My little finger
is thicker than my fatherâ€™s loins.
\v 11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips,
but I will chastise you with scorpions.
