\v 1 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
\q
\v 2 And Job answered and said:
\q
\v 3 Let the day perish wherein I was born,
\q And the night which said, There is a boy conceived.
\q
\v 4 Let that day be darkness;
\q Let not God from above seek for it,
\q Neither let the light shine upon it.
\q
\v 5 Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own;
\q Let a cloud dwell upon it;
\q Let all that makes black the day terrify it.
\q
\v 6 As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it:
\q Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;
\q Let it not come into the number of the months.
\q
\v 7 Lo, let that night be barren;
\q Let no joyful voice come therein.
\q
\v 8 Let them curse it that curse the day,
\q Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
\q
\v 9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark:
\q Let it look for light, but have none;
\q Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:
\q
\v 10 Because it shut not up the doors of my motherâ€™s womb,
\q Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.
\q
\v 11 Why died I not from the womb?
\q Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?
\q
\v 12 Why did the knees receive me?
\q Or why the breasts, that I should suck?
\q
\v 13 For now should I have lain down and been quiet;
\q I should have slept; then had I been at rest,
\q
\v 14 With kings and counselors of the earth,
\q Who built up waste places for themselves;
\q
\v 15 Or with princes that had gold,
\q Who filled their houses with silver:
\q
\v 16 Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,
\q As infants that never saw light.
\q
\v 17 There the wicked cease from troubling;
\q And there the weary are at rest.
\q
\v 18 There the prisoners are at ease together;
\q They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
\q
\v 19 The small and the great are there:
\q And the servant is free from his master.
\b
\q
\v 20 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,
\q And life to the bitter in soul;
\q
\v 21 Who long for death, but it comes not,
\q And dig for it more than for hid treasures;
\q
\v 22 Who rejoice exceedingly,
\q And are glad, when they can find the grave?
\q
\v 23 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,
\q And whom God has hedged in?
\q
\v 24 For my sighing comes before I eat,
\q And my groanings are poured out like water.
\q
\v 25 For the thing which I fear comes upon me,
\q And that which I am afraid of comes to me.
\q
\v 26 I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;
\q But trouble cometh.
