\p
\v 12 And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation,
says Jehovah, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it desolate for ever.
\v 13 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book,
which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
\v 14 For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them, even of them; and I will recompense them according to their
deeds, and according to the work of their hands.
