  - The **Translation Upload**  screen opens. It shows the details of the project you will upload.
  - If you have completed the translation of this project, tap the slide bar on the right. Otherwise continue to step 5.
      - The slide bar should turn blue and the text should say, "We will now perform a few checks to ensure your translation is ready."
      - Tap **Continue ** at the bottom of the screen to run the checks on your translation.
      - If there is a problem, you will see an exclamation mark withe in a circle.  Tap the exclamation mark.  You will need to address each issue before you can continue with your upload.  Tap **Cancel ** to go back and correct your work.
