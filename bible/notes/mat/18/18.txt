\v 18 Truly I say to you, whatever things you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever things you
shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\v 19 Moreover I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they ask for, it will be done
for them by my Father who is in heaven.
\v 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in their midst.

===== Important Terms: =====

  * Heaven
  * Father

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you**  - Jesus is speaking to his disciples throughout verses 18-20
  * **bind/bound- ** Same Greek word meaning one of two things: Either physically connecting or "binding" one thing to another or a metaphorical term meaning to put one under obligation or contractual responsibility.
  * **loose/loosed**  - Same Greek word with multiple definitions meaning either: to physically loosen or release something from bondage or to dissolve or do away with.
  * **verse 18**
 - Matthew uses a "doublet" to emphasize his point.  (See Doublet definition)
  * **verse 19**  - Verse 19 speaks to the authority of church leadership in matters of the faith.  In verses 12-14 if the spiritual authority (or shepherd) chooses not to pursue the lost sheep (an individual) they are lost forever.  In verses 15-17 if the church does not pursue restoration a person will forever be disconnected from the God.
