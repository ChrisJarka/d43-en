\v 8 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
\v 9 Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomites
that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots.
\v 10 So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day: then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand,
because he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers.
