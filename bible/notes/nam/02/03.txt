\v 3 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his
preparation, and the cypress spears are brandished.
\v 4 The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches; they run
like the lightnings.
