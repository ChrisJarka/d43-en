\v 28 Then Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* said, "I was not the one who decided to do all these things that I have done. It was Yahweh who \add chose me and\add* sent me to do them. And now he will prove that to you.
\v 29 If these men die in a normal way, then it will be clear that Yahweh did not choose me.
\v 30 But if Yahweh does something that has never happened before, if he causes the ground \add that is under their feet\add* to open up and swallow these men \add and their families\add* and all their possessions, and they fall into the opening and are buried while they are still alive, then you will know that these men have insulted Yahweh."

\v 28 And Moses said, "By this you will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them of my own accord.
\v 29 If these men die the common death of all men or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then Yahweh has not sent me.
\v 30 But, if Yahweh makes a new thing and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that is theirs and they go down alive into Sheol, then you will understand that these men have despised Yahweh."
