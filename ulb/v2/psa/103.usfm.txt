\c 103
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Bless Jehovah, O my soul;
\q And all that is within me, bless his holy name.
\q
\v 2 Bless Jehovah, O my soul,
\q And forget not all his benefits:
\q
\v 3 Who forgives all your iniquities;
\q Who heals all your diseases;
\q
\v 4 Who redeemeth your life from destruction;
\q Who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
\q
\v 5 Who satisfies your desire with good things,
\q So that your youth is renewed like the eagle.
\q
\v 6 Jehovah executes righteous acts,
\q And judgments for all that are oppressed.
\q
\v 7 He made known his ways to Moses,
\q His doings to the children of Israel.
\q
\v 8 Jehovah is merciful and gracious,
\q Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness.
\q
\v 9 He will not always chide;
\q Neither will he keep his anger for ever.
\q
\v 10 He has not dealt with us after our sins,
\q Nor rewarded us after our iniquities.
\q
\v 11 For as the heavens are high above the earth,
\q So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him.
\q
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west,
\q So far has he removed our transgressions from us.
\q
\v 13 Like as a father pitieth his children,
\q So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.
\q
\v 14 For he knows our frame;
\q He remembers that we are dust.
\q
\v 15 As for man, his days are as grass;
\q As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
\q
\v 16 For the wind passes over it, and it is gone;
\q And the place thereof shall know it no more.
\q
\v 17 But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him,
\q And his righteousness to childrenâ€™s children;
\q
\v 18 To such as keep his covenant,
\q And to those that remember his precepts to do them.
\q
\v 19 Jehovah has established his throne in the heavens;
\q And his kingdom rules over all.
\q
\v 20 Bless Jehovah, you his angels,
\q That are mighty in strength, that fulfil his word,
\q Hearkening to the voice of his word.
\q
\v 21 Bless Jehovah, all you his hosts,
\q You ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
\q
\v 22 Bless Jehovah, all you his works,
\q In all places of his dominion:
\q Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
