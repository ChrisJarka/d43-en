\v 23 So the Jews continued the celebration they had begun, doing what Mordecai had written to them.
\v 24  At that time Haman (the son of Hammedatha) the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and he cast Pur (that is, cast lots), to crush and destroy them.
\v 25 But when the matter came before the king, he gave orders by letters that the wicked plan Haman devised against the Jews should come back on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
