====== Alternate Verses or Versification ======

The IT team will make the right verse show in the GW language, but there is a chance that the MTT might have another version that uses different numbering or includes different text. We should add a very brief note. Something like:



===== Examples =====

From Genesis 31:54
  * **Verse 55** - This verse in the ancient Greek translation is verse 32:1 in the Hebrew text. Please follow the national language Bible.

From Acts 8:36
  * **verse 37** - This verse was omitted because some of the older, more reliable, ancient texts did not include it. (See: Original Manuscripts)
