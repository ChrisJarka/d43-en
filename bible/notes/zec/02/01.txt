\v 1 And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.
\v 2 Then said I, Whither go thou? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what
is the length thereof.

s5
\v 3 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
\v 4 and said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason
of the multitude of men and cattle therein.
\v 5 For I, says Jehovah, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
