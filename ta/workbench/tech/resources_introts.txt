question: How do I use the Resources in translationStudio?



==== Resources in tS ====

To help translators make the best translation possible, translationHelps have been created. The Resources include translationNotes, translationWords, and translationQuestions.

The **translationNotes** are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain the context in which the stories from Open Bible Stories and the Bible was written as well as inform the translator of translation options available to them. See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:resources_types]] for more information.\\

The **translationWords** are important terms found in Open Bible Stories and the Bible. It is crucial that they be translated correctly. Each translationWord has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places that term is used in Open Bible Stories and the Bible to ensure that it has been translated correctly there, too.

The **translationQuestions** are available for the translator to check their work. These questions can be asked of anyone checking the translation work. Read the question, answer the question from the information in the translated text, look at the answer in the program. Do both of the answers match? Then the translation is clear and accurate.

Once you have consulted the translationHelps, then you are ready to make the best translation.

**Please use the Translation Resources when checking your translation!**
