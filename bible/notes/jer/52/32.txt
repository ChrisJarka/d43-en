  * **He spoke kindly to him** - "Evil-Merodach spoke kindly to Jehoiachin"
  * **a seat more honorable** - "a seat at the table that was closer to where Evil-Merodach sat"
  * **removed Jehoiachin's prison clothes** - The reader should understand that removing his prison clothes is a synecdoche for making him a free man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
