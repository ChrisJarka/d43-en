====== Doublet ======


===== Description =====

In a **doublet** two words or short phrases that mean basically the same thing are used together–-typically, as a way to reinforce the concept. The two words are often joined with "and."  In the Bible, doublets are often used in poetry, prophecy, and sermons.

Note: We are using the term **doublet** for __words or short phrases__ that mean basically the same thing and are used together. We are using the term **parallelism** for __long phrases or clauses__ that are similar in grammatical structure or idea and are used together.
