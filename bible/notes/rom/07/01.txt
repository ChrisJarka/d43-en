===== Translation Notes: =====
  * **Or do you not know, brothers (for I speak to people who know about law), that the law controls a person for as long as he lives?-** Paul is asking this question to emphasize a point. UDB changes the question into a statement. (See:[[en:ta:translate: Rhetorical Question]])  
  * **you- **  Here, Paul is addressing Jewish Christians.
  * **the law controls a person- **  This is treating the law like it is a live person. (See: personification)
  * **the law controls a person for as long as he lives-**  This means that if a person is required by law to do something, he or she only has to follow the law while alive. Paul gives an example of what he means in verse 2, stating that a married woman is bound by law in marriage to her husband while he is alive, but if he dies, she is no longer legally married to him.
