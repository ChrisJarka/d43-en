====== See how you translated this ... ======

We often see a phrase repeated throughout a book. It would be good if the translators would translate that phrase consistently. So rather than write a note explaining the phrase each time it occurs, we prefer to direct the translators to see how they they translated it before. 

If the idea in the phrase is pretty simple, they may be able to keep translating it the way they translate it the first time. But if the idea will be new to their readers, the translators might need to take more words to explain it the first time. After that they may shorten the phrase.  So when we put in a link, we prefer to put it to the second time the phrase is used in the book. Links to previous verses should follow the format below.
