====== Overview ======

The unfoldingWord technical initiatives are broken down into various projects.  Each of these projects is run by a team of people who each have specific goals within that project.  The roles defined below are the categories that everyone on the team falls into.

^  Accountability  ^  Responsibility  ^  Authority  ^
| Tracker: single person who ensures communication and progress occur | Implementer: group that does the majority of the work to make it happen | Decision Maker: group that makes the high level decisions |

Each of these people or teams must work together to make the project move forward.  Though each has a unique role, the relationship between the three is reciprocal:
