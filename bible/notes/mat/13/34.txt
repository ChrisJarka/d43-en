\v 34 All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and without parables he said nothing to them.
\v 35 This was in order that there might come true what had been said through the prophet when he said,
\q "I will open my mouth in parables;
\q I will say things that were hidden from the foundation of the world."
