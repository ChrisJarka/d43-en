<usfm>
\v 8 The \add armies of the\add* nations that \add attacked you and\add* took away your valuable possessions have attacked those who are very precious to the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels [IDI]. So he says this about me: "After I have honored him and sent him to \add rebuke\add* the nations,
\v 9 \add it is as though\add* I will strike them with my fist, with the result that those who were their slaves will now take back those possessions from those who caused them to become slaves." And when that happens, you will know that the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels is the one who sent me.

\v 8 For thus says Jehovah of hosts: After glory has he sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he that touches
you touches the apple of his eye.
\v 9 For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them; and you shall know that
Jehovah of hosts has sent me.
