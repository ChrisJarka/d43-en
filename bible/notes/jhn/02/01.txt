===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **third day**  - In John's story to this point, Jesus and his disciples have experienced four days full of events already. This "third day" is the seventh day in the story as John tells it. In the Jewish culture, seven is an important number.
    * **there was a wedding**  - Alternate Translation: "A wedding happened" or "A wedding occurred" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
    * **wedding**  - In Jewish culture, a wedding feast lasted one week (seven days). Every day the husband's (groom's) family must provide food and drink for all the guests. If the family did not provide enough food and drink, it brought shame on the family.  
    * **Jesus also was invited**  - The family of the husband (groom) was responsible for inviting guests. Alternate Translation: "The groom's family invited Jesus" or "They also invited Jesus" (UDB). (See:  [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
