\v 11  And which of you whose son shall ask his father for a loaf, shall give to him a stone, or for a fish, a serpent?

\v 12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?

\v 13 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father out of heaven* give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?
