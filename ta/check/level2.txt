===== Checking Level Two â€“ External Check =====

==== Definition of Checking Level Two ====

The purpose of level two checking is to verify that representative groups from the local language community agree that the translation is a good one.

Level Two checking will be done in two ways:

  - Language Community Check. The translation will be checked by members of the language community to make sure that it is clear, natural, and understandable. For the steps to follow to do the Language Community Check, click [[:en:ta:check:languagecommunity|here]].


Answer the following questions on Door43. The answers to these questions will help those in the wider Christian community know that the audience finds the translation to be clear, accurate, and natural. 
a. Have you tested the translation by reading it to your community members and asking for feedback? 
b. Were you able to use this information to make the translation clearer and easier to understand? 
c. List a few passages where the community feedback was helpful. How did you change these passages to make them clearer? 
d. Write an explanation for some of the Important Terms, explaining how they are equal to terms used in the national language. This will help the checkers understand why you chose these terms. 
e. Does the community verify that there is a good flow to the language when the passages are read out loud? (Does the language sound like the writer was a person from your own community?) 

The community leaders might want to add to this their own information or make a summary statement about how acceptable this translation is to the local community. This can be included as part of the Level Two checking information. The wider church leadership will have access to this information, and it will help them validate the translation as approved by the wider Christian community when they do Level Three Checking. 


  - Church Leader Check. The translation will be checked by a group of church leaders from the language community to make sure that it is accurate. For the steps to follow to do the Church Leader Check, click [[:en:ta:check:churchleader|here]].
