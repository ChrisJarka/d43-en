\v 11 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them,
according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.
\v 12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
\v 13 And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bare witness against him, even
against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of
the city, and stoned him to death with stones.
\v 14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
