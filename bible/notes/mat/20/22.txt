\v 22 But Jesus answered and said, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink?" They said 
to him, "We are able."
\v 23 He said to them, "My cup you will indeed drink. But to sit at my right hand and at 
my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
\v 24 When the other ten disciples heard this, they were very displeased with the two brothers.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * This is continuing the conversation between Jesus and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 
  * **You do not know**  - This "you" is speaking about the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 
  * **Are you able**  -The "you" in this phrase is referring to the sons of Zebedee.
  * **They said to him, "We are able"**  -The "they" and the "we" are again referring to the sons of Zebedee. 
  * **the cup that I am about to drink**  - This idiom is not referring to a physical cup for drinking, but rather it is referring to Christ's suffering that he will have to endure. (See: Idiom)
  * **it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father**  - This can be made active by saying "It is for those whom my Father prepares."
  * **they were moved with resentment**  - The "they" here is referring to the other ten disciples. This could be made active by saying "They became angry."
  * **resentment**  - This could be translated as "strong displeasure" or "anger".
