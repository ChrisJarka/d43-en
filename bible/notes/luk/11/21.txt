\v 22 But when someone else who is stronger attacks that man and subdues him, he is able to take away the weapons in which the man trusted. Then he can take from that man's house anything he \add wants to\add*.
\v 23 \add No one can be neutral\add*. Those who do not help me\add are opposing\add* me, and those who do not gather \add people to become\add* my\add disciples\add* are causing \add those people\add* to go away \add from me\add*."
