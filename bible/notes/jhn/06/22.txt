\v 22 The next day the crowd of people that had stayed on the other side of the lake, they realized that there had been only one boat there the day before. They understood that Jesus had not gone in the boat with his disciples.
\v 23 Some men came across the lake from the city of Tiberias in other boats they had. They put their boats near the place where the people had eaten the bread, that bread for which the Lord had given thanks to God.
