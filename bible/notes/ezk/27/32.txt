<usfm>
\v 32 And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee,
saying, Who is there like Tyre, like her that is brought to silence in the midst of the sea?
\v 33 When your wares went forth out of the seas, you filled many peoples; you did enrich the kings of the earth with the
multitude of your riches and of your merchandise.
