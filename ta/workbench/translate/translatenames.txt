====== How to Translate Names ======

This module answers the question: How can I translate names that are new to my culture?\\ 

Summary \\ 
Names are the thing most people are afraid of reading the Bible out loud. And important meanings of names are lost making it difficult to understand the point of the passage. But with good translation strategies you can defeat those difficulties. \\  
==== Description ====
Definition \\ 
The Bible has many names of people, places, groups and areas. All names have meaning, Most names in the Bible are to identify the people and places being talked about; but the importance of some names are their meaning. \\  
Examples \\ 
>** It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings.** (John 12:12 ULB) 
Melchizedek is used here as a name of a man. \\ 

>** His name "Melchizedek" means "king of righteousness," and also "king of Salem," that is, "king of peace.** (Hebrews 7:2 ULB) 
Here the name, Melchizedek, is used for its meaning. \\ 

**Reason this could be a translation issue ** \\ 
Many of the names in the Bible are unknown to your people. Often they do not know if a person, place or thing is being mentioned. Also the names may have different sounds or combinations of sounds that are not used or unpleasant to say in your language. Some people, places or things have two names. The reader may not realize that they are the same.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**You went over the Jordan and came to Jericho. The leaders of Jericho fought against you, along with the Amorites** (Joshua 24:11 ULB)
“You went over the river of Jordan  and came to the city of Jericho. The leaders of Jericho fought against you, along with the tribe of the Amorites”
>**she said, "Do I really continue to see, even after he has seen me?"  Therefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; ** (Genesis 16:13-14 ULB) 
>**She named him Moses and said, Because I drew him from the water.** (Exodus 2:11 ULB)
               >** Saul was in agreement with his death** (Acts 8:1 ULB)
>** It came about in Iconium that Paul and Barnabas entered together into the synagogue** (Acts 14:1 ULB)
  
==== Translation Strategies ==== 
-	If it is a name used to identify a person, place or thing; write it in your own language but if it is not known in your language add a word to identify it. For example: a man named Nicodemus, the town of Nazarath, the country of Syria. When writing the names use another letter for sounds you do not have in your own language and remember what letters may go together or may end a word. Example Nasarata for Nazarath. Warning: if the word written in your language has a bad or wrong meaning, change some letters to make not a word in your language.
-	If the name is used for its meaning and is only used in this one place, just use its meaning.
-	If the name is used for its meaning but then becomes a name used elsewhere, give the name and the meaning.
-	If some person, place or thing may have two different names, use one throughout and put a footnote for the other or when the name changes make it clear that this  is the same person or place as the former named person or place.

1.	If it is a name used to identify a person, place or thing; write it in your own language but if it is not known in your language add a word to identify it.

When writing the names use another letter for sounds you do not have in your own language and remember what letters may go together or may end a word. Example Nasarata for Nazarath.

2.	If the name is used for its meaning and is only used in this one place, just use its meaning.
**she said, "Do I really continue to see, even after he has seen me?"  Therefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; ** (Genesis 16:13-14 ULB) 
 she said, "Do I really continue to see, even after he has seen me?"  Therefore the well was called Well of the One who sees me."

3.	If the name is used for its meaning but then becomes a name used elsewhere, give the name and the meaning.
**She named him Moses and said, Because I drew him from the water.** (Exodus 2:11 ULB)
She named him Moses, “meaning drawn out” and said, Because I drew him from the water.
4.	If some person, place or thing may have two different names, use one throughout and put a footnote for the other or when the name changes make it clear that this  is the same person or place as the former named person or place.
** Saul was in agreement with his death** (Acts 8:1 ULB)
** It came about in Iconium that Paul and Barnabas entered together into the synagogue** (Acts 14:1 ULB)
Saul and Paul are the same person. Acts 8:1 could be translated “Paul was in agreement with his death.”

===== Description =====
**Common Nouns verse Names**\\ 
A common noun is a noun that refers in general to a person, place, thing, or idea. Examples of common nouns are "man", "nation",  "religion", and "organization". A name refers to what people call a specific person, group of people, place, thing,  or idea. Examples of names are "John Smith," "Kenya," "Christianity" and  "Harvard University".  \\

**Reason this is a translation issue** \\

  - Readers may know a person or place by a name different from the one in the source text. 
  - Readers may see a name and not know what kind of thing it is the name of. 
  - Readers may know that a name is the name of a person, but they may need some important information about the person so they can understand the passage.
  - Some people and places have more than one name in the Bible.
  - Sometimes a name tells something important about the person or place whose name it is.
  - Sometimes readers get a wrong meaning because a Bible name sounds like a common noun in their language.

**Translation Principles**: If in  your culture, a name is simply used to identify a person or place, it may be enough to simply borrow the name. If in your culture the meaning of a name is very important, you may want to translate the meaning of the name.

===== Translation Strategies =====    
  - Borrow the name.  To learn about how to borrow names, see  [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]].
  - Borrow the name and add a common noun to help people know what kind of name it is. 
  - Borrow the name and add a footnote telling the meaning of the name. 
  - Translate the meaning of the name. 
 
**Translations Strategies for people and places that have new or alternate names** 
If a person or place has two names, follow one of these two ways. In either case, it may be necessary to add a footnote that explains that the two names refer to the same person or place: 
  - Use the name that occurs in the particular text you are translating. 
  - Use one name most of the time and the other name only when the text talks about that name or the meaning of that name. 
  - Add a footnote that explains that the two names refer to the same person or place:

  * **He built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him** (Genesis 3:7) 
 
2. Borrow the name and add a common noun to help people know what kind of name it is. You  will need to decide whether it is more natural in your language to put the name before or after the common noun.  
  * **You went over the Jordan and came to Jericho.**  (Joshua 24:11)
    * "You went over __the Jordan River__ and came to __the city of Jericho__. "
 
  * Go and leave here because Herod wants to kill you.  (Luke 13:31) 
    * Go and leave here because the ruler Herod wants to kill you. 
 
3.  Borrow the name and add a footnote telling the meaning of the name. 
  * **He built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him** (Genesis 3:7)   
    * In a footnote write: "The name El Bethel means "God of Bethel". 

4. Translate the meaning of the name. 
  * **You went over the Jordan and came to Jericho.**  (Joshua 24:11)
    * "You went over the __Going-Down River__ and came to the __Good-Smelling City__" 
    * 
  * **He built an altar there and called the place __God of Bethel__, because there God had revealed himself to him** (Genesis 3:7)   
    * "He built an altar there and called the place __God of the House of God__, because there God had revealed himself to him, (Genesis 3:7)   
 
**People and Places with New or Alternate Names** \\ 

1. Use the name that occurs in the particular text you are translating. \\ 
[[Add example of one verse with Saul and one with Paul  (Or two names of some other person)]]

2. Use one name most of the time and the other name only when the text talks about that name or the meaning of that name.  \\ 
[[Use those two verses above, but put "Paul" and a footnote with the the one that is Saul in the ULB]]
