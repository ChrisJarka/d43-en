====== leaven ======

===== Definition: =====

Leaven is a substance, like yeast, used in the process of making bread to fill the dough with gas bubbles, that is, to make dough rise.

  * Once the leaven is added to the dough, the baker must allow time for the dough to rise.
  * Metaphorically, leaven is like sin because sin spreads through a person's life in the same way leaven spreads throughout dough.
  * The tribes of Israel were commanded to make bread without leaven because time would not be needed for the dough to rise, and this was to remind them of when they left Egypt in haste.
