====== Standard Notes for Minor Prophets ======

This is a growing list of 'standard notes' that occur frequently in the minor prophets. Please use these so that there are consistent notes about the same topic throughout the books.

When a standard note includes brackets (see examples below), replace the brackets with the detail that is appropriate for the text you are working on.

==== "This is Yahweh's declaration": ==== 

**this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])

==== "The word of Yahweh came": ====

**New** Notes Templates for **"The word of Yahweh came to [audience ... ] (saying)"**  -  
  * When writing notes, please replace "[audience]" with "me" or "[author]."
  * When the audience is a pronoun, I prefer to word the AT differently than I would with a name. I think that should be ok. ("gave a message to [author]" vs "gave me a message") 
  * The ellipsis in the first template represents an adverbial phrase. Don’t use the ellipsis if there is no adverbial phrase. If there is an adverbial phrase, put it into the snippet and ATs. (You can shorten the adverbial phrase by using its first and last words with an ellipsis in between.) 
  * When you write your notes, please do not end a snippet or AT with an ellipsis, and do not put any punctuation immediately before or after an ellipsis. 
  * After the six note templates, there is an example of how to write the AT in such a way that the ellipsis does not come at the end.

**The word of Yahweh came to [audience …] saying,** - This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. AT: "Yahweh gave a message to [audience …].

  * Here is an example from Jeremiah [[:en:bible:notes:jer:36:27|36:27]] of how to write a note when an adverbial phrase follows the audience. I replaced [audience] with Jeremiah, and put the first and last words of the adverbial phrase in the snippet and ATs. Because this has the adverbial phrase, I did not just say "This idiom" because the adverbial phrase is not part of the idiom. 

  * **The word of Yahweh came to [author] after ... dictation, saying,** - The idiom "The word of Yahweh came" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "Yahweh gave a message to [author] after ... dictation. He said," or "After ... dictation, Yahweh spoke this message to [author]:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
