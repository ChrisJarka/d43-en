===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **And this will be the sign to you from me** - Yahweh gives Hezekiah a visual proof that he will do what he has just now promised to him.
    * **I will cause the shadow on the stairs of Ahaz to go back ten steps** - Yahweh will literally move back the position of the sun and subsequently its shadow as a sign to Hezekiah of his promise. This can be translated as, "I will cause the shadow of the sun to move ten steps backward on the stairs that were built by King Ahaz". (UDB)
