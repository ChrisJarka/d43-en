  * **let this be your consolations** - The word "consolations" is an abstract noun and can be translated with the verbs "console" or "comfort." AT: "let this be how you console me" or "do this in order to comfort me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])

  * **Put up with me** - "Allow me" or "Be patient with me"
