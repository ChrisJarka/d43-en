\v 28 Then Jesus continued by saying, "\add From where God will send you\add*, you will see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the distance. All the prophets \add who lived long ago will also be there\add*, in the kingdom where God \add is ruling\add*. But you will be outside, crying and grinding your teeth \add because you will have severe pain!\add*
\v 29 Furthermore, many \add non-Jewish\add* people will \add be inside\add*. There will be ones who have come from \add lands to\add* the north, east, south, and west. They will be feasting in that place where God is ruling\f + \ft Or: God's kingdom \f*.
\v 30 Think about this: Some people whom others do not \add consider\add* important \add now, God will make\add* them very important \add then\add*, and some people whom \add others consider\add* very important \add now, God will make\add* to be not important \add then\add*."

\v 28 Then Jesus continued by saying, "You will see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the distance. All the prophets who lived long ago will also be there, in the kingdom where God is ruling. But you will be outside, crying and grinding your teeth in pain!
\v 29 Furthermore, many non-Jewish people will be inside. There will be ones who have come from lands to the north, east, south, and west. They will be feasting in God's kingdom.
\v 30 Think about this: Some people who seem the least important now will be the most important then, and others who seem important now, will be the least important then."

\v 28 There will be crying and the grinding of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in God's kingdom, but you -- you were thrown outside.
\v 29 And they will arrive from the east and west and north and south, and relax at the dinner table in the kingdom of God. 
\v 30 And know this, the last are the first, and the first will be last."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus continues to answer the question about who will be saved.)
    * **crying and grinding of teeth**  - these are expressions of anger, upset, fear, and despair.
    * **grinding**-word used to describe beasts which snarl & show teeth as they attack their prey
     * **but you – you were thrown outside.** - This is past tense in relation to them seeing Abraham and the prophets. This verse could also be translated as, “You will see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in God's kingdom, but you will cry and grind your teeth because you have been thrown outside.”    * **and they will come**  - or, "people will come"
    * **the last are the first**- that is, people who become children of God through faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord of their lives may become the first to enter God's kingdom while the Jews by their heritage through the ancestors like Abraham, Isaac and Jacob may be the last. It is not when you believe in God but how seriously you take him and obey him.
