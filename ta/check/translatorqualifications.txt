===== Questions about the Translator or Translation Team =====

The Language Community Church Leaders will answer the following questions about the translator or translation team:

  - Is the translator recognized as a qualified local language speaker?
  - Does the translator have adequate source language skills?
  - Is the translator respected in the community as a follower of Christ?

<font inherit/arial,helvetica,sans-serif;;inherit;;inherit>These additional questions will help the community leaders know if the translators have sufficient understanding of the target language and culture and of the source language to be able to translate the Bible or the Open Bible Stories:</font>

  - What is the age and local language background of each translator? (Has the translator been living in the local community for much of their life?)
  - Are they recognized as good speakers of their language by the local community? (Do people respect the way this person speaks their own language?)
  - What level of education have they received, and how have they obtained skills in the national language? (Does the Christian community recognize this person as having skills adequate to speak the national language and an education sufficient to use the exegetical helps provided?)
  - How long have they been a Christian, and are they in good standing with their Christian community? (How has this person shown themselves to be committed to Christ as a disciple? Are they respected in their Christian community?)
  - Does their work meet the expectations of their fellow translators and local church leaders? (Has the translator been willing to work with others in testing and checking their translation?)
