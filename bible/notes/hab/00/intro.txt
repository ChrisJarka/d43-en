=== What is the Book of Habakkuk about? ===

While many other [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophets]] complained about Israel's sin and failure to obey the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Yahweh]], Habakkuk focuses his complaint against Yahweh. Habakkuk complains about Yahweh using the Babylonians, who were more [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]] and deserving of Yahweh’s punishment. Overall, the book is addressed to the rich people in Judah who mistreated the poor and the evil religious leaders. Because of this [[:en:obe:kt:justice|justice]] is signficant in the book of Habakkuk.


=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 
Translators may decided to translate this traditional title "The book of Habakkuk" in a way that is more clear to the readers.They may decide to call it, "The sayings of Habakkuk." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]).

=== Who wrote Habakkuk? ===

There is not known about Habakkuk, the author of the book of Habakkuk. The the Chaldean empire, mentioned in several places in Habakkuk helps the dating of Habakkuk's life. The Chaldean empire reigned from about 720 to 538 BC. It is probable that Habakkuk wrote about the time of Jeremiah, Zephaniah, and Nahum during the reigns of Josiah, Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim in Judah.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
=== Why did God use an evil nation to punish Judah? ===

Habakkuk seeks to address this issue. He explains that a person's should be obedient to the Lord and live a [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteous]] life and that evil must be punished, but God determines the timing of their punishment. One must also remember that God is just.


===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How do I identify the speaker? ===

It should be noted that Habakkuk often speaks to Yahweh, and Yahweh replies to him. The translator should be careful to identify the speaker (Habakkuk, or Yahweh) in each section. The translator may wish to make the speaker explicit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])


=== What style of writing is the Book of Habakkuk? ===

While much of the book of Habakkuk is prophecy, the third chapter is a psalm. This chapter contains information about how to sing this psalm and the author uses musical terms. It is possible that Habakkuk had a priestly background. It is possible that this chapter contains an older form of the Hebrew language.

=== Does Habakkuk question or challenge God? ===
There are times when Habakkuk speaks directly to God which may be taken as challenging or questioning God. Habakkuk is not intending to question the authority of Yahweh but is stating "I do not understand". In some cultures, it may be improper to speak to an authority in this way. It may be necessary to rephrase Habakkuk questions to emphasize his sincere desire to learn why God is doing what he is doing without "second-guessing" or doubting him.
