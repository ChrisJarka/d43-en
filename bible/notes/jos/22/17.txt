<usfm>
\v 17 Have you forgotten what happened at Peor, \add when some Israelites sinned by worshiping the god that the Moab people-group worship\add*? Many Israelites became very sick and died because of that sin, and we are still suffering because of their sin.
\v 18 Are you now turning away from obeying Yahweh and refusing to do what he wants? If you do not stop right now rebelling against Yahweh today, he will be angry with all of us Israelites tomorrow.'

\v 17 Was our sin at Peor not enough for us, and yet we have not cleansed ourselves, and for which there came a plague upon the assembly of Yahweh,
\v 18 that you must also turn away from following Yahweh on this day? If you also rebel against Yahweh this day, tomorrow he will be angry with the whole assembly of Israel.
