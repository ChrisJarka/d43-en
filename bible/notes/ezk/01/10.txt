\v 10 The appearance of their faces were like the face of a man, next, the face of a lion to the right, next, the face of an ox to the left, and finally, the face of an eagle.
\v 11 Their faces were like that, and their wings were spread out above, so that each creature had a pair of wings that touched another creature's wing, and also a pair of wings that covered their bodies.
\v 12 Each went straight forward, so that wherever the Spirit directed them to go, they went without turning.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The appearance of their faces were like the face of a man**  - It was implied that Ezekiel is describing the faces of the creatures on their front side. Alternate translation: "In front, the faces of the creatures looked like the faces of people." (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **next, the face of a lion to the right** - This can be translated as a new sentence: "On the right side of the creatures, all four had faces that looked like the faces of lions."
  * **next, the face of a ox to the left** - This can be translated as a new sentence: "On the left side of the creatures, all four had faces that looked like the faces of bulls."
  * **a ox **- "a bull" or "a cow"
  * **and, finally, the face of an eagle.** - The way Ezekiel describes the creatures implies that the face of the eagle was on the back side of them. This can be translated as a new sentence: "On the rear side of the creatures, all four had faces that looked like the faces of eagles."
  * **eagle** - a kind of large bird that hunts other animals
  * **their faces were like that, and their wings were spread out above** - Alternate translation: "The faces and the wings of the creatures were spread out up above, so that two of the wings of the creatures touched the wings of other creatures."
  * **and also a pair of wings that covered their bodies** – This could be translated as a new sentence: "The other two wings of the creatures covered their bodies."
  * **Each went straight forward** – "Each creature went with a face looking forward"
