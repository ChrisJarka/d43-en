Sometimes when people read the Bible, they want to know certain things. But if those things were not part of the original message, then we would not state them clearly in the translation. 

===== Description =====

On [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] we learned the difference between implicit and explicit information, and about how we can state implicit information clearly in the translation when the readers need it 

Sometimes when people read the Bible, they want to know certain things that are not stated in the text. If these things are implicit information, translators may state them clearly. However, some things that both the speaker and their audience knew are not implicit information, because the audience did not need to understand them in order to understand the message. 

> You rejected the Holy and Righteous One, and you asked instead for a murderer to be released to you.  (Acts 3:14 ULB)

When Peter said "a murderer," the people who were listening to him may have remembered that the man's name was Barabbas. But they did not need to remember the man's name in order to understand Peter's message. So this information was not implicit information.


=== Reason this is a translation issue === 
  * Sometimes the author intentionally left some things unclear. The translator should not try to make them more clear that the author did.
  * Sometimes the original audience did not understand what the speaker meant. Do not make it so clear to your readers that they would find it strange that the original audience did not understand.


=== Translation Principles (optional) ===
  * It is not necessary to include all background information for the target audience to understand the text. There is a lot of information that the original audience knew about the things that are in the Bible. Only include the information that the target audience needs to know so that the message is clear.
  * Do not add any information that is not part of the original message. There may be things that the original audience would have known, but not everything would help them understand the speaker's message.
