\v 3 Then tell them that I, Yahweh, the God whom the Israelite people \add worship\add*, said that I will curse everyone who does not obey what was written in that agreement that I made with them.
\v 4 It is the same agreement that I made with their ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt. \add What happened to them in Egypt was terrible; it was as though they were\add* living in a hot furnace \f + \ft metaphor \f*. When I brought them out of Egypt, I told them to obey me, and to do everything that I had commanded them to do. I also told them that if they obeyed me, they would be my people and I would be their God.
\v 5 \add Now tell these people that if they obey me\add*, I will do what I promised to do for their ancestors. I will enable them to continue living in this very fertile [IDI] land in which they now live."
\p I replied, "Yahweh, I hope that what you said will happen."

\v 3 and say you to them, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man that hears not the words of this
covenant,
\v 4 which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace,
saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall you be my people, and I will be your God;
\v 5 that I may establish the oath which I sware to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this
day. Then answered I, and said, Amen, O Jehovah.
