\v 4 Therefore, when you \add believers\add* have a dispute, you should certainly not choose as judges \add to decide your case\add* people whom the congregation cannot respect \add because those judges are not believers!\f + \ft Or: \add*why do you choose as judges \add to decide your case\add* people whom the congregation cannot respect \add because those judges are not believers\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 5 I am saying this to make you ashamed. Surely there is someone among you who is wise enough to judge disputes between believers!\f + \ft Or: Is there no one among you who is wise enough to judge disputes between believers? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 6 But instead, some believers \add among you\add* accuse other believers in a legal court. And what is worse, you let the cases be judged by unbelievers \f + \ft Or:unbelievers judge the cases \f*!

\v 4 And it follows that if you can adjudicate in matters that are important in this life, why would you find it necessary to hand off disputes between Christians to those who have no standing in the church and are unbelievers?
\v 5 I say this to show you that you are shaming the church and those in it. There certainly must be someone in the church who is wise enough to settle these disputes within the church, in cases that come up between Christian brothers and sisters.
\v 6 But instead, some believers among you accuse other believers in a secular court that before a judge who in an unbeliever!

\v 4 If then you have to judge things pertaining to this life, why do you lay such cases before those who have no standing in the church? 
\v 5 I say this to your shame. Could it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers and sisters?
\v 6 But one believer goes to court against another believer, and that case is set before a judge who is a non-Christian?
