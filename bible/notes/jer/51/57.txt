\v 57 And I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall
sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.

with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary.
