====== Introduction to Romans ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of Romans ===

  - Paul begins his letter normally by introducing himself and saying who he was writing to (1:1-15)
  - Next he writes about the state of mankind and possible salvation through Jesus Christ (1:16-11:36)
  - After this Paul gives several practical instructions for Christian living (12:1-15:13)
  - He finishes Romans by giving several greetings to people in the church at Rome (Chapter 16)

=== What is Romans about? ===

The occasion for this letter was that Paul was preparing to leave Corinth so he could take a gift of money back to Jerusalem, to help the church in Jerusalem that was suffering. After going back to Jerusalem, Paul planned to travel to Rome to encourage the church there, and soon after that, he hoped to travel on to Spain to start new churches there.  Paul writes this letter to prepare for this journey to Rome.  He stated his purpose was to “bring about the obedience of faith” (16:26).
 
Most scholars would agree that Romans is the most profound and theologically rich letter in the New Testament. More has been written about the book of Romans than any other book of the Bible.
 
In Romans, Paul describes Jesus Christ with these titles and descriptions: Jesus Christ (1:1), The Seed of David (1:3), The Son of God (1:4), The Lord Jesus Christ (1:7), Christ Jesus (3:24), Propitiation (3:25), Jesus (3:26), Jesus our Lord (4:24), Lord of Hosts  (9:29), A Stumbling Stone and Rock of Offence (9:33), The End of the Law (10:4), The Deliverer (11:26), Lord of the Dead and the Living (14:9),and the Root of Jesse  (15:12).
 
Here is a list of some important theological terms:  Righteousness (1:17), Sin (3:20), Justification (5:1), Grace (1:7), Reconciliation (5:7), Gospel (1:16), Salvation (1:16), Propitiation (3:23-25), Imputation (4:6-8), Sanctification (6:1-13), Preservation (8:35-39), Supplication (8:26, 27), Transformation (12:1, 2) and Glorification (8:16-23).

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Romans" or "Paul's Letter to the Church in Rome." Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, for example, "." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Romans? ===

Paul of Tarsus was the author. He wrote to the Roman Christians, probably while he was staying in Corinth on the third of his missionary journeys. Paul had been known as “Saul” when he was a Pharisee and a persecutor of the church before his conversion to faith in Christ. He was a scholar in the Jewish law, but he became a Christian and an apostle of Jesus Christ.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Romans? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of manuscripts that many believe are more accurate. The follow are the most significant issues in the Gospel of John:\\

  * "" (5:3-4) (so noted in ULB)
  *  

Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to John's Gospel.

Some old versions also have this passage:

  * "going through the midst of them, and so passed by" (8:59)

But it is very certain that this passage was not original to the Gospel of John; it should not be included.
