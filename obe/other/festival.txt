====== festival ======

===== Definition: =====

In general, a festival is a celebration held by a community of people.

  * The word for "festival" in the Old Testament literally means "appointed time."
  * The festivals celebrated by the Israelites were specially appointed times or seasons that God had commanded them to observe.
  * There were several main festivals that the Israelites celebrated every year. Sometimes they were called "feasts" because they usually involved eating a large meal together.
  * The main festivals were:
    * Passover
    * Unleavened Bread
    * Firstfruits
    * Feast of Weeks (Pentecost)
    * Feast of Trumpets
    * Day of Atonement
    * Festival of Booths
  * Each of these feasts were to thank God and to remember the amazing things he had done to rescue, protect, and provide for his people.
