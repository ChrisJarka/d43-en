===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to sit in a boat near the beach and tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * **All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and without parables he said nothing to them**  - This is a doublet. The second phrase expresses nearly the same idea again but in a reversed order and using two negative expressions. (See: Doublet)
  * **All these things **- This refers to the previous parables.
  * **without parables he said nothing to them **- This is an apparent hyperbole that can be understood as "he taught them nothing except by a parable" or as in the UDB. (See: Hyperbole)
  * **what had been said through the prophet when he said **- This can be translated with an active verb: "what God said through the prophet" or as in the UDB. (See: Active or Passive)
  * **when he said**  - "He" is the prophet.
  * **I will open my mouth in parables; I will say things that were hidden from the foundation of the world**  - This quote from the Old Testament book of Psalms expresses two related ideas in parallel form. (See: Parallelism.)
  * **I will open my mouth**  - This is an idiom that means "I will speak." (See: Idiom)
  * **I will say things that were hidden from the foundation of the world**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "I will say things that God has kept hidden since he created the world" or as in the UDB.
  * **I will say **- "I will proclaim" or "I will utter"
  * **from the foundation of the world**  - This is an expression that can be translated "since the beginning of the world" or "since the world was created."
