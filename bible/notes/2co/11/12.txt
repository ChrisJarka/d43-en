===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 There are \add some men there among you\add* who would like to be able to say boastfully that they \add work among you\add* just as I do. So, in order to make it impossible \f + \ft idiom \f* \add for them to say that\add*, I have \add refused to accept pay from you\add*, and I will continue doing that.
\v 13 Those men are lying \add when they say that they are\add* apostles. They work deceitfully. \add Even though they say that they work for God, they are working only for themselves\add*. They try to make people think that Christ \add sent them\add* as his apostles, \add but they do not truly represent him\add*.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

\v 12 I will continue to serve you in this same way, so that I stop those who say that they are equal to us. They will no excuse to offer for how they boast.
\v 13 Such people are false apostles claiming that God has sent them. They are workers who always tell lies, and they are pretending to be apostles of Christ.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 But what I am doing, I also will do. I will do it so that I might cut off the opportunity of those who desire the opportunity to be found as we are in what they are boasting about.
\v 13 For such people are false apostles and deceitful workers. They disguise themselves as apostles of Christ.
