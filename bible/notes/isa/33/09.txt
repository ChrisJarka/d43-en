===== Translation Notes: =====
Lebanon, Sharon, Carmel, and Bashan are the four most beautiful regions of the Holy Land, taking the word in its widest extent.

    * **The land mourns and withers away** - "The land of Judah is dry and barren"
    * **Lebanon is confounded and withers away** - Lebanon is the northern mountain-range, one hundred and twenty miles in length, clad with cedars and firs. Alternate translation: "The cedar trees in Lebanon are drying up and decaying." (UDB)
    * **Sharon is like a desert plain** - Sharon is the broad rich tract of land which stretches southwards from the foot of Carmel and is known for its flowers and forests. The plains of Sharon are now dry like a desert.
    * **and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves** - Carmel is the upland dividing Sharon from the Esdraelon plain, famous for its "rocky dells" and "deep jungles of copse." Bashan is the trans-Jordanic upland, stretching from the flanks of Hermon to Gilead, celebrated for its "high downs" and "wide-sweeping plains," for its "forests of oak," and in ancient times for its herds of wild cattle. The trees in Bashan and Carmel shake down their leaves.
