===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You know nothing at all**  - Caiaphas does not use this phrase because he thinks they know nothing but because they haven't thought of the same solution he has. Alternate translation: "You talk as if you do not know what to do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **it is expedient for you**  - The "you" refers to the Jewish leaders and their followers who were fearful that Jesus might start a rebellion.
  * **expedient**  - This word means a better way to solve a problem
  * **one man**  - Caiaphis said "one man" meaning Jesus.
  * **the whole nation would perish**  - Caiaphis speaks of the nation as if it can die but he does not mean the nation would die and he does not mean all the people in the nation would die.  He says this because he believes that Jesus could cause a change in their culture and their government. This means the traditional way of doing things in the nation would stop and it would change into something else. Alternate translation: "our traditions to be forgotten" or "the whole nation would change" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
