===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **"Skin for skin, indeed;**  - "value for value, indeed;" This is likely a figure of speech used in commerce. The next verse, by expanding on the meaning, helps the reader understand it. The entire phrase means that this is an unexpected, even ironic, and very personal form of the term "skin," meaning Job's own skin. (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]], and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
    * **put forth your hand**  - The meaning of this is to cause something to happen. See the meaning, " “by the hand of the Lord” means that the Lord is the one who did it." listed above under the Important Term: [[:en:obe:other:hand]].
    * **renounce you to your face.”**  - See UDB for meaning and alternate wording.
    * **“See, he is in your hand;**  -  This means that Satan must impose his own suffering on Job. It has a different meaning than the term "hand" above. It means, "giving someone over to the power or control of someone else." Also listed above under the Important Term: [[:en:obe:other:hand]]. See UDB for alternate wording.
    * **only spare his life.”**  - See UDB for meaning and alternate wording.
    * **bold words**  - explanation
