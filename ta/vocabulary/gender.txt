===== Gender Notations =====

A lot of languages don't have a distinction between "he" and "she", they use "it" for people. In fact, when Chinese students speak English they often mistakenly refer to men as "she" and women as "he".


Interestingly I was just watching a pastor give a sermon where he quotes a Bible passage pertaining to marriage, and claims "whomever" is a masculine pronoun. I know "whomever" can stand for men or women thus it is not masculine, it is neutral. Apparently, however, the original sentence was talking about a person being "betrothed to whomever", which implies that the "whomever" definitely refers to a man.
