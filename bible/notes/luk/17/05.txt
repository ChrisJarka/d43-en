  * **If you had faith as a mustard seed**  - That is, "If you had faith that was even as small as mustard seed" or "if only your faith was as big as a mustard seed, but it isn't." The construction of the phrase implies that they did not, in fact, have faith that was that big.
  * **be uprooted, and be planted in the sea**  - That is, "uproot yourself and plant yourself in the sea" or "take your roots out of the ground, and put your roots down into the ocean."
