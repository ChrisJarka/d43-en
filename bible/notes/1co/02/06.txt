====== 1 Corinthians 02:6-7 ======

<usfm>
\v 6 I do teach a message that people who are  \add spiritually\add* mature  \add consider to\add* be wise. But I do not teach a message that unbelievers  \add consider to be\add* wise. I also do not teach a message that unbelieving rulers in the world consider to be wise. \add What they think about it does not matter\add*, because  \add some day\add* they will lose their power\f + \ft Or: not be ruling anymore \f*.
\v 7 Instead, I teach about what God planned wisely  \add long ago\add*. It is something that people did not know about previously because  \add God\add* did not reveal it previously. But God determined before he created the world that he would greatly benefit us by his wise plan.

\v 6 And so we teach a weighty and important message--a message of wisdom for those who can bear it and who can grasp its meaning. The wisdom we proclaim does not come from this world, and it is not a message the world wants to hear. This message is not from the rulers of this age, who have power over the most important decisions in this age. They rule the world now, but they are quickly passing away.
\v 7 We proclaim a hidden wisdom that God has made known to us. God promised this to us, and before there was time or creation, he made a glorious vow that this hidden wisdom, now made known to us, that would bring glory into our lives.

\v 6 Now we speak wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this world, or of the rulers of this age, who are passing way in their importance.
\v 7 But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery; the hidden wisdom that God foreordained before the ages, and that will be for our glory.
