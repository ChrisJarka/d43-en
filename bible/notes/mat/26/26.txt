  * [[:en:obe:other:bread|bread]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:bless|blessed]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:disciple|disciples]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **blessed it **- This can be translated "gave thanks for it" or "thanked God for it." (UDB).
  * **and broke it **- “he ripped it” or “he tore it.” He may have divided it into many pieces or he may have divided it into two pieces and given them to the apostles to divide among themselves. If possible, use an expression that could be used for either situation.
  * **This is my body **- Possible meanings are 1) “This bread is my body” and 2) “This bread represents my body.” This is probably to be understood as a metaphor (See: Metaphor)
