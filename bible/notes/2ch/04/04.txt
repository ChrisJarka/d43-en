\v 4 The sea stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east. The sea was set on top of them, and all their hindquarters were toward the inside.
\v 5 The sea was as thick as the width of a hand, and its brim was forged like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. The sea held two thousand baths of water.
\v 6 He made also ten basins for washing things; he put five on the right hand, and five on the left; items used in performing the burnt offering were to be washed in them. The sea, however, was for the priests to wash in.
