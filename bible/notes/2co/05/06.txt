\v 6 So, because God's Spirit lives in us, we are always confident that God will give us new bodies. We know that as long as we live in our bodies here on earth, we are not yet living together with the Lord Jesus in heaven.
\v 7 While we live here, we do not have our new bodies, but we are trusting that God will give them to us.
\v 8 As I said, we would much prefer to leave these bodies in which we are now living, and be with the Lord Jesus in our home in heaven.

\v 6 Therefore always be confident, knowing that while we still have our human bodies, we are away from the Lord
\v 7 (for we walk by what we believe, not by what we see);
\v 8 So we have confidence, and are would rather be away from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.
