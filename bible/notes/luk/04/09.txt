\v 9 Then the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem. He set him on the highest part of the temple and said to him, " If you really are the Son of God, jump down from here.
\v 10 You will not be hurt, because it is written in the Scriptures, 
\q1 'God will command his angels to protect you.’
\v 11 And it also says, 
\q1 ‘They will lift you up in their hands when you are falling, so that you will not get hurt. You will not even strike your foot on a stone.'”

\v 9 Next the devil led Jesus to Jerusalem, and put him on the very highest point of the temple building, and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here. 
\v 10 For it is written, 
\q1 'He will command his angels to take care of you, to protect you.'

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **the devil led **- That is, “the devil took him up” or “the devil brought him up.” This does not mean that the devil was leading the way or that Jesus was following him. Rather, it was an active effort of putting him at the described destination.
    * **the very highest point**  - This was the corner of the temple roof. If someone slipped or jumped from there, they would not land safely without God's help.
    * **if you are**  - There is a similar phrase in Luke 4:3. A possible translation is "since you are," but some prefer to translate it as a challenge like "if you are really" or "assuming you are indeed" or "you claim that you are."
    * **throw yourself down from **- That is, the devil told Jesus to "jump down from" the highest point of the temple.
    * **it is written -**  Rather, “it has been written.” This implies authority and truthfulness, such as “it is written in the Scriptures” or “it is written in the authoritative Scriptures.” It could be translated as "a prophet wrote" or "someone wrote."
