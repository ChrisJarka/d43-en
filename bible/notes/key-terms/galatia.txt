====== Galatia ======

===== Facts: =====

In New Testament times, Galatia was a large Roman province located in the central part of what is modern-day Turkey.

  * Paul wrote a letter to the Christians who lived in the province of Galatia. This letter is the New Testament book called Galatians.
  * The Gentile Christians in Galatia were being influenced by the Jewish Christians there to keep some of the Jewish laws. That is the reason Paul wrote his letter to the Galatians, to emphasize again the gospel of salvation by grace, not works.
