===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The words of a gossip are like delicious morsels** - This speaks of gossip being desirable to listen to as if it were delicious food to eat. AT: "The words of a gossip are desirable to listen to" or (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **they go down into the inner parts of the body** - This speaks of the words that a gossip say going into a person's mind and effecting his thoughts as if it were food that were going into his stomach. This sentence is equivalent to [[:en:bible:notes:pro:18:07|18:8]]. AT: "and they enter a person's mind and affect his thoughts"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The glaze overlaying an earthen vessel is like burning lips and an evil heart** - This compares people with burning lips and an evil heart to a clay vessel that is covered with glaze. AT: "People who say nice things while thinking about doing evil things are like a nice glaze covering a container made of clay" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **The glaze overlying an earthen vessel** - "the shiny glaze that covers a clay pot." The shiny glaze is pretty, but a pot made of only clay is not worth as much as a pot made of metal.
  * **burning lips** - "Burning" is a metaphor for "strongly emotional." "Lips" is a metonym for "speech." AT: "emotional speech" or "saying nice things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
