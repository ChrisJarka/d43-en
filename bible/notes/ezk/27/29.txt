<usfm>
\v 29 And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships;
they shall stand upon the land,
\v 30 and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads; they
shall wallow themselves in the ashes:
\v 31 and they shall make themselves bald for you, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for you in bitterness of
soul with bitter mourning.
