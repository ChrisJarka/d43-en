===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 The most important reason Christ sent me was not to baptize people but to tell everyone the good news about him. I proclaimed the good news not so it was established by human wisdom and with the use of clever words, but so that the message is built on the foundation of the work of Christ when he died on the cross.

\v 17 For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of human wisdom, so that the cross of Christ should not be emptied of its power.
