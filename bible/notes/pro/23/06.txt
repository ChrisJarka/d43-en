<usfm>
\v 6 If someone who is stingy \add invites you to a meal\add*,
\q1 do not eat a lot of his fine food,
\q2
\v 7 because he will be thinking about how much \add the food cost that you are eating\add*.
\q1 He will say to you, "Eat and drink all that you want!", but that is not what he will really be thinking.
\q1
\v 8 \add When you realize what he is really thinking, it will cause you to want to\add* vomit what you have eaten;
\q2 and your kind words \add telling him that you are enjoying the meal\add* will be wasted.

<usfm>
\q
\v 6 Eat you not the bread of him that has an evil eye,
\q Neither desire you his dainties:
\q
\v 7 For as he thinks within himself, so is he:
\q Eat and drink, says he to thee;
\q But his heart is not with thee.
\q
\v 8 The morsel which you have eaten shall you vomit up,
\q And lose your sweet words.
