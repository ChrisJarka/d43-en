<usfm>
\v 26 But now, all you people from Judah who are now living here in Egypt, listen to this message from Yahweh. He says, 'I have solemnly declared, using my great name, that soon none of you people from Judah who are here in Egypt will ever again use my name. \add There will be none of you who, when you solemnly promise to do something\add*, will ever again say, "\add I will do it as surely\add* as Yahweh lives."
\v 27 Because I will be watching over you, not to cause good things to happen to you but to cause things to happen that will harm you. Almost everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* from Judah who is now here in Egypt will experience being \add killed by their enemies'\add* swords or dying from famine.
\v 28 Only a very few of you will not die, and will return to Judah. When that happens, all those who came to Egypt will find out whose words were true\f + \ft Or: were fulfilled \f*, theirs or mine.'

\v 26 Therefore hear you the word of Jehovah, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name,
says Jehovah, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the
Lord Jehovah liveth.
\v 27 Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be
consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.
\v 28 And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the
remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.
