<usfm>
\v 15 \add Believers should reject\add* what they teach about food\add , because\add* no \add food that we eat\add* can make us unacceptable to God if we are pure \add in our\add* \add inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts\add* \f*. But if people are evil \add within themselves\add* and they do not trust \add in Christ Jesus\add*, there is no \add ritual\add* that can make them acceptable to God. Such people's way of thinking has been ruined \f + \ft Or:Such people have ruined their way of thinking \f*, and they do not even feel guilty \add when they do what is evil\add*.
\v 16 Even though they claim\f + \ft Or: say \f* that they know God, by what they do they \add show that they\add* do not know God\f + \ft Or: his true teaching \f*. They do not obey \add God\add*, and they are unable to do anything that he considers to be good\add . So God considers them to be absolutely\add* disgusting!

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 To the person who is pure in his mind and conscience, everything is pure, but for people who are evil within themselves and who do not trust in Christ Jesus, nothing is pure. Such people have ruined their way of thinking, and they do not even feel guilty when they do what is evil.
\v 16 Even though they claim to know God, what they do shows that they do not know him. They are detestable and disobedient and unable to do any good work for God.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 To the pure man, all is pure, but to the polluted and unbelieving man, nothing is pure. But for them, even the mind and conscience are polluted. 
\v 16 They confess to know God, but what they do denies Him; and, they are detestable and disobedient and prove to be unfit for any good work.
