\v 22 So Edom has been in rebellion against the rule of Judah to this present day. Libnah also revolted at the same time.
\v 23 As for the other matters concerning Jehoram, all that he did, are they not written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah?
\v 24 Jehoram died and rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. Then Ahaziah his son became king in his place.
