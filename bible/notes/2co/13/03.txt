\v 3 Because you have demanded that I prove to you that Christ is speaking \add to you when\add* I \add speak to you, I will show you that I speak to you as his apostle. Christ\add* does not approve of your sinful behavior. On the contrary, he will powerfully \add discipline you\add*.
\v 4 \add It is true that\add* Christ \add seemed to be\add* weak when he was crucified \f + \ft Or:when \add people\add* killed him by nailing him to the cross \f*. But \add it is also true that\add* he \add now\add* lives because God \add worked\add* powerfully \add to make him alive again. Similarly\add*, as I \add serve\add* God, I also am a weak human \add being as Christ was\add*. But I am also \add have a close relationship with\add* Christ \add who is now alive again\add*. And with his \add authority\add* I will use God's power \add to discipline\add* you.

\v 3  since you are looking for proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but he is working in you by his great power.
\v 4 We learn from Christ's example, because they crucified him when he was weak, yet by God's power he lives. And we, too, we live in weakness as we follow his example, but with him we also have the power of God when we confront these sins in you.
