====== know, have relations with, lie with, sleep with ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, these terms are euphemisms that refer to having sexual intercourse. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:euphemism|Euphemism]])

  * In Genesis it says that Adam "knew" Eve and she conceived children. This expression is usually used for a husband with his wife. Some English versions translate this with the expression "made love to" or "was intimate with."
  * For references to sexual relations outside of marriage, the expression "lay with" or "sleep with" is often used.
  * A translation may use different expressions in different contexts, depending on whether it is talking about a husband and wife or whether it is talking about some other relationship. So it is important to make sure that the translation of this term has the correct meaning in each context.
