\c 129
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q
\v 1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up,
\q Let Israel now say,
\q
\v 2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up:
\q Yet they have not prevailed against me.
\q
\v 3 The plowers plowed upon my back;
\q They made long their furrows.
\q
\v 4 Jehovah is righteous:
\q He has cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
\q
\v 5 Let them be put to shame and turned backward,
\q All they that hate Zion.
\q
\v 6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops,
\q Which withereth before it grows up;
\q
\v 7 Wherewith the reaper fills not his hand,
\q Nor he that bindeth sheaves, his bosom:
\q
\v 8 Neither do they that go by say,
\q The blessing of Jehovah be upon you;
\q We bless you in the name of Jehovah.
