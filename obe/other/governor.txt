===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The word "governor" can also be translated as “ruler” or "overseer" or "regional leader" or "one who rules over a small territory."
  * Since a governor was under the authority of a king or emperor and had less power and importance than those rulers, this term should be translated differently than those terms.
