\v 26 Her priests do violence to my Law and they profane my holy things. They do not discern between the holy and the profane, and do not teach differences 
between the unclean and the clean. They hide their eyes from my Sabbaths so I am profaned in their midst!
\v 27 Her princes in her midst are like wolves rending prey to pour out blood to destroy souls in order to gain unjust profit by violence.
\v 28 And her prophets have overlaid them with whitewash: they see false visions and predict falsehoods to them, and say “Thus says the Lord Yahweh” 
when Yahweh has not spoken!
