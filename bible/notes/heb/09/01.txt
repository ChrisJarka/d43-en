===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The writer makes clear to these Jewish believers that the laws and the tabernacle of the old covenant were just pictures of the better new covenant.

  * **first covenant** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:08:06|8:7]].
  * **regulations** - "detailed instructions" or "rules" or "directions"
  * **For** - The author is continuing the discussion from [[:en:bible:notes:heb:08:06|8:7]].
  * **there was a room prepared** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Israelites prepared a room." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **bread of the presence** - This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "presence" is expressed as the verb "present, display." AT: "bread on display before God" (UDB) or "bread the priests presented to God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
