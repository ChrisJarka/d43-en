====== Definitions ======



==== Description =====

Sometimes you may not know what a word in the ULB means. The notes may have a definition or a description of the word or phrase to help you understand what they mean. 

==== Translation Notes ====

Simple definitions of words or phrases are added without quotes or sentence format. Here are examples:

  * **marketplace**  - a large, open-air area where people would come to sell their goods
  * **flute**  - a long, hollow musical instrument which is played by blowing air in or over one end
  * **kings' palaces**  - a large, expensive house that a king lives in

=== Translation Principles ===  
  * Use words that are already part of your language if possible.
  * Keep expressions short if possible.
  * Represent God's commands and historical facts accurately.
