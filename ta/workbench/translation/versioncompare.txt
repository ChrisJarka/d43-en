What is translation? Translation is the process of representing in one language (the "project language") the ideas found in a document (the "source text") written in a different language.

Why does the translator do this? Translators can have different reasons for doing their work. In the case of Bible translation, people usually do their work because they want the Bible's ideas to affect the project language readers in the same way that the original readers and hearers of the biblical texts were affected. Because God's ideas in the Bible lead us to eternal life with him, translators also want project language readers to know his ideas.
