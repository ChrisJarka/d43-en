===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **My dwelling is removed and carried away from me like a shepherd’s tent** - Hezekiah continues his prayer and compares his life being taken away to a tent whose pegs have been removed and taken away by a shepherd. This can be translated as, "It is as if my life had been taken away like a tent whose pegs have been pulled up by a shepherd and taken away." (See: Simile)
    * **I have rolled up my life like a weaver; you are cutting me off from the loom** - This is also a Simile where he has to roll up his life like a weaver, like a weaver who cuts up cloth and rolls it up. 
    * **Like a lion he breaks all my bones** - This is comparing his pain to the pain caused as though he were being torn apart by lions. This can be translated as, "But my pain was as though I were being torn apart by lions." (See: Metaphor)
