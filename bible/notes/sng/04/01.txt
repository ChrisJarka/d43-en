===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]

  * **Your eyes are doves** - One possibility is that the man is speaking of the woman's white eyeballs or the shape of her eyes, the shape of a dove. Another possibility is that the Israelites considered doves to be gentle and soft birds, and the man considers the woman's eyes beautiful because the way the woman looks at him makes him think she is gentle. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:15|1:15]]. AT: "You are very gentle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **my love** - "you whom I love." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:09|1:9]].
  * **Your hair is like a flock of goats going down from Mount Gilead** - Goats in Israel were usually dark in color. The woman's hair was probably dark. You may need to specify that the goats were dark or even use another simile that the reader will understand that refers to something dark and beautiful. People thought of Mount Gilead as beautiful and fertile. The speaker considered the woman beautiful and ready to become the mother of his children. If you remove the simile of the goats, you may have to remove the simile of the mountain as well. AT: "Your hair is as dark as storm clouds above a fertile land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
