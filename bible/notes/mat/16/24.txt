\v 24 Then Jesus said to us disciples, "If any one of you wants to be my disciple, you must not do only what you yourself wantto do. You must be willing to let people hurt you and disgrace you. That is like what they do to criminals whom they force to carry a cross  to the place where the criminals will be executed. That is what anyone who wants to be my disciplemust do.
\v 25 You must do that, because those who try to save their lives by denying that they belong to me when people want to kill them for believing in me will not live eternally, but those who are killed because of being my disciples will live with God eternally.
\v 26 People might get everything they want in this world, but if they do not become my disciples, they would really be gaining nothing because they would not get eternal life!

\v 24 Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
follow me.
\v 25 For whoever would save his life shall lose it: and whoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.
\v 26 For what shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? or what shall a man give in
exchange for his life?
