\v 8 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: "Because you have had false visions and have told lies"â€”therefore this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration
against you:
\v 9 "My hand will be against the prophets who have lying visions and who make false predictions. They will not be in the assembly of my people, 
or enrolled in the record of the house of Israel; they must not go to the land of Israel. For you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh!
