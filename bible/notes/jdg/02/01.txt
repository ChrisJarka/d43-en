\v 1 The angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim. He said, â€œI made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought
you to the land which I swore to your fathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you.
\v 2 You will make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you will break down their altars.' But you have not
listened to my voice; why have you not?
