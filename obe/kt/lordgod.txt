====== Lord ======

===== Facts: =====

The term "Lord" is often used at a title that refers to God.

  * The word "lord" means someone who has ownership or authority over people. God is the ultimate authority who created everything and rules over everything.
  * Many Bible versions use the term "Lord" or "LORD" to translate the word for God's personal name, "Yahweh," meaning "I am" or some variation of that. This is because some time after the Old Testament was written, the Jews became so afraid of mispronouncing God's holy name that they stopped saying the name Yahweh and said "Lord" instead.

Many Bible versions therefore use the term "Lord" or "LORD" to translate the word for God's personal name, "Yahweh," meaning "I am" or some variation of that. Those who wrote the New Testament followed this pattern and wrote "Lord" instead of "Yahweh." 

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Make sure it is clear that the names "Yahweh" in the Old Testament refer to the same God as the title "the Lord" in the New Testament.
  * Some languages would use “Master” or some other word that communicates ownership or supreme ruler.
