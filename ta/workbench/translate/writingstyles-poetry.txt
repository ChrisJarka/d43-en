Poetry combines figures of speech with pleasant sounds and deep feelings to make a passage both beautiful and easier to remember.
===== Description =====

Poetry is one of various way in which to use words to make the writing more beautiful and to show the feeling. It is used to express a stronger emotional feeling than simple non-poetic forms would express. Poetry is easier to remember and tends to last longer than ordinary speech.

**Some things commonly found in poetry**
  - Many Figures of Speech such as [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]], and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]].
  - Parallel lines (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[talink Parallelism with the Same meaning]])
  - Repetition of some or all of a line
    * **Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his angel armies. Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars.** (Psalm 148:2&3)
  - Lines of similar length.
    * **Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude.** (1 Corinthians 13:4)
  - The same sound used at the end or at the beginning of two or more lines
    * “Twinkle, twinkle little star. How I wonder what you are.” (from an English rhyme)
  - The same sound repeated many times
    *“Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater” (from an English rhyme) 
  - Old words and expressions
 
**Some places to look for poetry in your language**
  - Songs, particularly old songs or songs used in children’s games
  - Religious ceremony or chants of priests or witch doctors
  - Prayers, blessings, and curses
  - Old legends

**Elegant or fancy speech**
Elegant or fancy speech is similar to poetry in that it uses beautiful language but not all the features of poetry in the language and not as much of the ones it does use. Popular speakers in the language use elegant speech, and is the probably the easiest source of text to study to find out what makes speech elegant in your language.

**Reasons this could be a translation issue:** 
  * Different languages use poetry for different things. If a poetic form would not communicate the same meaning in your language you may need to write it without the poetry.  
  * In some languages, using poetry for a particular part of the Bible would make it much more powerful.
===== Examples from the Bible =====

The Bible uses poetry for songs, teaching and prophecy. Almost all of the books of the Old Testament have poetry in them and many of the books are completely poetry. 

1. Many figures of speech (There are examples from the Bible on each of the tA pages.)

2. Parallel lines \\ 
**For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel,** \\ 
**and the men of Judah his pleasant planting** (Isaiah 5:7)\\
In both of these lines God's people are called God's "planting" or  "vineyard."

3. Repetition of some or all of a line \\ 
**Oh, give thanks to Yahweh; for he is good, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever.**\\ 
**Oh, give thanks to the God of gods, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever.** \\ 
**Oh, give thanks to the Lord of lords, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever.** (Psalm 136:1-3) \\ 
The phrases "give thanks" and "his covenant faithfulness endures forever" are in each of these three verses.



===== Translation Strategies =====
If the style of poetry that is used in the source text would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here are some other ways of translating it.

  - Translate the poetry using one of your styles of poetry.
  - Translate the poetry using your style of elegant speech.
  - Translate the poetry using  your style of ordinary speech.

If you use poetry it may be more beautiful. \\ 
If you use ordinary speech it may be more clear.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

**Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked,**\\ 
**or stand in the pathway with sinners,** \\
**or sit in the assembly of mockers.**\\
**But his delight is in the law of Yahweh,**\\
**and on his law he meditates day and night.** (Psalm 1:1,2)

The following are examples of how people might translate Psalm 1:1,2.

1. Translate the poetry using one of your styles of poetry.\\
(The style in this example has words that sound similar at the end of each line.)

"Happy is the person not encouraged __to sin__\\ 
Disrespect for God he will not __begin__ \\ 
To those who laugh at God, he is __no kin.__\\

God is his constant __delight__ \\ 
He does what God says __is right__ \\
He thinks of it all day __and night__"\\

2. Translate the poetry using your style of elegant speech.\\
  * "Do you want to be truly happy? Then do not listen to people who do not love God. Do not join with people who plan to do evil things. And by all means, stay far away from those who laugh at God. Instead revel in God, constantly bathing yourself in his will."

3. Translate the poetry using your style of ordinary speech.\\
  * "The people who do not listen to the advice of those who disobey God are really happy. They do not spend time with people who continually do evil things or with those who do not respect God. They think all the time about how they can please and obey him."
