===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Who among you will listen to this? Who will listen and hear in the future?** - "Who and "you" refer to the people of Judah. Isaiah is telling the people of Judah to pay attention to what happened to Israel. 
    * **Who gave Jacob over to the robber, and Israel to the looters?** - Isaiah wants to emphasize that Yahweh was the one that allowed Israel to be conquered by Assyria, so he asks this question.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **Was it not Yahweh, against whom we have sinned, in whose ways they refused to walk, and whose Law they refused to obey** - Isaiah includes himself with the people of Judah when he uses "we" have sinned.  Again he emphasizes that Yahweh is in control.   (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) He also points out that as the people of Israel sinned, so are the people of Judah sinning.
