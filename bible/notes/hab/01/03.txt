<usfm>
\v 3 Why do you show me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention rises up.
\v 4 Therefore the law is slacked, and justice does never go forth; for the wicked does compass about the righteous; therefore justice goes forth perverted.
