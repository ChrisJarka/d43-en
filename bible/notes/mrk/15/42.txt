\v 42 And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
\v 43 there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God;
and he boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
\v 44 And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any
while dead.
