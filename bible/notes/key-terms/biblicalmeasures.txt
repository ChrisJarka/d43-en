====== Biblical measures ======

===== Definition: =====

The following terms are the most common Biblical units of measure used to explain how much liquid (such as wine) or solid objects (such as grain) a certain receptacle contains.

  * bath - 22.0 liters
  * hin - 3.7 liters
  * homer - 230.0 liters
  * kab - 1.3 liters
  * kor - 220.0 liters
  * log - 0.3 liters
  * seah - 7.7 liters

How to translate units of measure in the Bible:

  - Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. [See Transliterate]
  - An important reason for keeping the Bible terms is to show that the Bible is true and people actually used these units of measure during that time period.
  - If it doesn't work to use the Bible term, then instead, state the equivalent distance or length in terms of a unit of measure that is known.
