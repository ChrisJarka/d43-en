===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])

  * **If my heart has been deceived by a woman** - Here "my heart" represents Job. Here the word "deceived" expresses the idea of "enticed." The word "woman" expresses the idea of "another man's wife." This can be stated in active form. AT: "If another man's wife has enticed me" or "If I have desired another man's wife" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **if I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door** - It can be stated clearly why he was waiting at his neighbor's door. AT: "if I have waited at my neighbors door so I could sleep with his wife" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **then let my wife grind grain for another** - Possible meanings are 1) this is an euphemism which means Job is saying may his wife sleep with another man or 2) it means she will become a slave and work for another man. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
