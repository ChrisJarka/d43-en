===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I saw ** <font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>â€“ Isaiah begins to describe a vision that God gave to him. This could be translated as "I saw in a vision" or "YHWH gave me, Isaiah, a vision of."</font>
  * <font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>** the Lord sitting **</font>    **** <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>- When Isaiah saw the Lord, the Lord was sitting. Isaiah was not the one sitting.</font>
  * **on a high and elevated throne **- The words "high" and "elevated" most likely form a hendiadys meaning "very high" or "extremely high." The hight of the throne emphasizes the supreme authority and holiness of the Lord. (See: Hendiadys)
  * Seraphim - These creatures are only mentioned in Isaiah 6, verses 2 and 6. The word in Hebrew suggest that the creatures might have a fiery appearance or resemble snakes. Because we do not know exactly what the "seraphim" are, it would be best to translate the word with a generic term such as "creatures" or "living things" or "beings".
