====== hades ======


===== Definition: =====


The bible refers to Hades as the place where the dead live after departing this life. Hebrew people used the word Sheol to describe the same place. 


    * Hades has a place of comfort for those who have their sin forgiven by Christ. There is a place of torment for those who reject Christ.
    * When God performs the final resurrection of the dead and final judgement of all mankind those who know Christ will live in a new heaven and new earth while those rejecting Christ will depart to the lake of fire.
