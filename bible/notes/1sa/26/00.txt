====== 1 Samuel 26 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

David had another opportunity to kill Saul but he refused to kill the one God had chosen as king. 

Saul went again to find David and kill him. He made camp and was sleeping in the middle of his army. David went down and took the spear and water bottle from just above Saul's head. Then he claimed a mountain and shouted down to Saul's men. Saul recognized his voice and David told me to kill you but I refused. Here is your spear and water bottle. Send someone to get it back. Saul admitted that David was indeed more righteous than he was because he did not kill his enemy.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Question ==
David put his reason for not killing Saul in a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]: "Do not destroy him; for who can extend his hand against Yahweh's anointed one and be guiltless?"
