====== Irony ======


===== Description =====

Irony is using words to say the opposite of what you mean. Irony is typically used to be humorous or to place emphasis on the differences in something. In irony, sometimes a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it.

=== Mat:05:29 ===

"And if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you; for it is better for you that one of your body parts should perish, than that your whole body should be thrown into hell."

  * **if your right eye causes you to stumble**  - "if what you see causes you to stumble" or "if you want to sin because of what you see." "Stumble" is a metaphor for "sin." Jesus is using irony here, as people usually use their eyes to keep from stumbling over things. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]], [[:en:ta:translate:irony]])

=== Luk:10:21 ===

"At that same time he rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, "I praise you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you concealed these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to those who are untaught, like little children."

  * **the wise and understanding**  - "from people who are wise and understanding." This can be translated as "from people who think they are wise and understanding." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:irony]])

=== Luk:13:33 ===

"In any case, it is necessary for me to continue on today, tomorrow, and the following day, since it is not acceptable to kill a prophet away from Jerusalem."

  * **it is not acceptable to kill a prophet outside of Jerusalem**  - "it is not right for a prophet to die outside of Jerusalem." Jesus was using irony. It was never right to kill God's prophets, and certainly not in Jerusalem. But the Jews had killed many of God's prophets there, and Jesus knew that they would kill him there too. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:irony]])
