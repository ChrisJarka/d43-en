\v 26 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast your law behind their back, and killed your prophets
that testified against them to turn them again to thee, and they wrought great provocations.
\v 27 Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their
trouble, when they cried to thee, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviours
who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.
