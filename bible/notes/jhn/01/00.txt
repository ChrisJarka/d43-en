====== John 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 1:23, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "The Word" ==
This is a rather unique construction used to reference Jesus. He is the word of God embodied in flesh and the final revelation of God himself on earth. Although this can appear to be a complex teaching, it is rather simple: Jesus is God, the creator of the heavens and the earth.

== Light and Darkness ==
These are common images in the New Testament. Light is used here to indicate the revelation of God and his righteousness. Darkness describes [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] and sin seeks to remain hidden from God.

== "Children of God" ==
When one believes in Jesus, they go from being a "child of wrath" to a child of God. They are adopted into the "family of God." This is an important image that will be unfolded in the New Testament.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
Although the other gospel accounts frequently contain [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphors]] in the teachings of Jesus and in prophecy, the first chapter of this gospel uses metaphors in interpreting meaning of the life of Jesus. Because of these metaphors, the reader can see that this gospel is going to be a more in-depth a theological understanding of the life of Jesus. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "In the beginning was the word" ==
The first part of this chapter follows a logical and almost poetic pattern to it that will be difficult to duplicate in translation.

== The twelve disciples ==

The following are the list of the twelve disciples: In Matthew: Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.

In Mark: Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot,

In Luke: Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James, the son of Alphaeus, Simon, who was called the Zealot, Judas, the son of James, and Judas Iscariot,

It is probable that Thaddaeus and Jude, the son of James, are two names of the same person.

== "Son of man" ==
Jesus refers to himself as the [[:en:obe:kt:sonofman|Son of Man]]. Some languages may struggle having a person refer to himself in the third person.
