\v 22 Instead, you have come to the presence of God who truly lives in heaven, to the "New Jerusalem." That is like what your ancestors did when they came to worship God on Mount Zion in Israel, upon which the earthly Jerusalem was built. You have come to where there are countless angels who are rejoicing as they have gathered together.
\v 23 You have joined the assembly all the believers who have privileges as firstborn sons, whose names God has written down in heaven. You have come to God, who will judge everyone. You have come to where the spirits of God's people are, people who lived righteously before they died, and whom God has now made perfect in heaven.
\v 24 You have come to Jesus, who arranged a new covenant between us and God by the blood that flowed when he died on the cross. Jesus' blood made it possible for God to forgive us, and his blood is better than was Abel's blood.

===== Translation Notes: =====

In the previous section, the writer told what the Israelites had when they were at at Mount Sinai. The  writer then contrasts here the new covenant.

     * **you**  - English does not use formal and informal forms of “you.”   In this verse you is plural and neuter. It refers to all Christians.    (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) 
    * **you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God ... to ten thousands of angels ... to the assembly of all the firstborn ... to God ... to the spirits of the righteous ... to Jesus ... to the sprinkled blood**  - All of the eight places the author says that followers Jesus "have come to" in these verses are intangible to us, though real; they are spiritual realities.  The repetition of "you have come to" shows the new spiritual reality for followers of Jesus. It is no less real than what the Hebrews physically experienced at Mount Sinai. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:idiom]])
    * **ten thousands of angels**  - "an uncountable number of angels"
    * **registered in heaven** - A register is a list of names.  God knows all those who follow him by name.  (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metaphor]])
    * **you have come ... to the spirits of the righteous**  - Followers of Jesus are now part of the great assembly of other followers whose spirits are made righteous.
    * **the sprinkled blood that speaks better than Abel's blood**  - The author is referring to a previous emphasis in chapter 9 that Jesus' blood sprinkled in the presence of God is superior to the blood of animals sprinkled in the tabernacle.  While Abel's blood does not physically speak, it represents guilt, that justice has not been satisfied; Jesus blood proclaims forgiveness via the satisfaction of justice. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
