====== Simon the tanner ======

.

===== Facts: =====

"Simon the Tanner" was a believer who lived in Joppa, and hosted Peter in his home while he ministered there.

  * After Peter raised a Christian woman named Tabitha (also known as Dorcus) from the dead, he stayed with "Simon the Tanner" in Joppa.
  * Peter had his dream about the sheet with many kinds of unclean animals on it while he slept on the roof of "Simon the Tanner's" house.
  * Because he came in contact with dead animals as a tanner, he would have been an outcast to the Jews. It would have been a great effort for Peter to accept this gentile tanner in fellowship, but he did so in obedience to God.
