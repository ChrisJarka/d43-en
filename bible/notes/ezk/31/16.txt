\v 16 I caused the people of other nations to tremble when they heard that tree fall to the ground. They realized that it would decay, as all people who die and are buried decay. And all the people represented by other beautiful trees in my garden in Eden and in Lebanon, who were like beautiful trees that were very proud, ones that had roots that grew down deep into the ground where there was plenty of water, were comforted when the king represented by that cedar tree was there with them in the place where the dead people are.
