\v 45 And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as
Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has wrought with God this day. So the people
rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
\v 46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
