====== Introduction to 2 Peter ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of 2 Peter ===

  - Introduction (1:1-2)
  - Reminder to live good lives because God has enabled us to (1:3-21)
  - Warning against false teachers (2:1-22)
  - Encouragement to prepare for the second coming of Jesus (3:1-17)

=== What is the Book of 2 Peter about? ===

Peter wrote this letter in order to encourage believers to live good lives and to warn them not to follow false teachers (2).  He encouraged them to ignore people who are saying that Jesus is taking too long to come back.  Instead he pointed out that God is not slow but wants everyone to be saved (2 Peter 3:8-9).  This is a reason to live a good life (3:14).

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 Peter” or "First Peter." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The First Letter from Peter,” or “The First Letter Peter wrote.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of 2 Peter? ===

The letter of 2 Peter states that it was written by the Apostle Peter, but many scholars today do not think that is true.  It is possible that someone else wrote it on Peter's behalf.  The author does say that he was an eyewitness to the life of Jesus and specifically to the transfiguration (1:17-18).  If Peter wrote the letter it is likely that he wrote it in Rome between 65-69 years after the birth of Christ, before he died.  Peter also calls it his second letter (3:1) placing the date of writing after the letter of 1 Peter.  He addressed the letter to all Christians. 


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== How were Christians treated in Rome? ===

This letter was probably written from Rome. During the time when this letter was written, Christians were treated very badly. Because of this persecution, Peter may have referred to Rome as "Babylon." This emphasizes their sinfulness. Peter explains that the true of those who are persecuted is in the return of Christ.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Why are English translation of 1 Peter so different? ===

1 Peter is one of the most difficult books to translate. There are several contributing factors to this. The most significant is that it originally contains many long sentences in Greek. This make the relationship between clauses somewhat uncertain and difficult to translate smoothly. 

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Peter? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of 1 Peter:\\

  * "through the Spirit" (1:22). Some older versions omit this phrase

Translators are advised not to translate this phrase. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region have it, it is not wrong to translate it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of 1 Peter.
