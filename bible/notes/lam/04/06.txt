===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than that of Sodom** - The abstract noun "punishment" can be expressed with the verb "punish." AT: "The daughter of my people has been punished more severely than Sodom was punished" 
  * **the daughter of my people** - This is a poetic name for Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lam:02:11|2:11]]. AT: "my people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **which was overthrown in a moment** - The word "which" refers to Sodom. This can be stated in active form. AT: "which God destroyed in a moment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **no hands were wrung for her** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one wrung their hands for her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **no hands were wrung for her** - People sometimes rub and twist their hands when they are worried and cannot fix something, so wringing the hands here represents worrying. The word "her" refers to Jerusalem, which was called "the daughter of my people."  AT: "no one was worried about her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
