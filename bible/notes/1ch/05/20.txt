<usfm> \v 20 They received divine help against them. In this way, the Hagrites and all who were with them were defeated. This was because the Israelites cried out to God in the battle, and he responded to them, because they put their trust in him. \v 21 They captured their animals, including fifty thousand camels, 250,000 sheep, two thousand donkeys, and 100,000 men. \v 22 Because God fought for them, they killed many of the enemy. They lived in their land until the captivity. </usfm>
