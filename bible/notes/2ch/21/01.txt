\v 1 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Jehoram his son reigned
in his stead.
\v 2 And he had brethren, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and
Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
\v 3 And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah:
but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the first-born.
