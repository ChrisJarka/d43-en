\v 22 And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament; it looked like an awe-inspiring crystal stretched out over their heads above.
\v 23 Beneath the firmament, each one of the wings touched another. Each of the living creatures had a pair to cover themselves--each had a pair to cover their own bodies.
