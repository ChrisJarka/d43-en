\v 32 And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that
followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen to him,
\v 33 saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the
scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:
\v 34 and they shall mock him, and shall spit upon him, and shall scourge him, and shall kill him; and after three days he
shall rise again.
