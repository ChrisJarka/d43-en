\c 3
\p
\v 1 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also
it is with you;
\v 2 and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all have not faith.
\v 3 But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and guard you from the evil
one.
\v 4 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that you both do and will do the things which we command.
\v 5 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
\p
\v 6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that
walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us.
\v 7 For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
\v 8 neither did we eat bread for nothing at any manâ€™s hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not
burden any of you:
\v 9 not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an ensample to you, that you should imitate us.
\v 10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat.
\v 11 For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies.
\v 12 Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own
bread.
\v 13 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.
\v 14 And if any man obeys not our word by this epistle, note that man, that you have no company with him, to the end that he
may be ashamed.
\v 15 And yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

\p
\v 16 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.
\v 17 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.
\v 18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
