===== Order of Events =====

//This page answers the question:// //Why are the events not listed in the order they happened, and how do I translate them?//

==== Description ====

In the Bible, events are not always told in the order in which they occurred. Sometimes the author wanted to discuss something that happened at an earlier time than the event that he just talked about, or he wants to start talking about one event, then mention earlier events. This can be confusing to the reader.

In some languages this does not cause a problem, but in other languages events are always told in the order in which they occurred. In these languages, readers might misunderstand a story that tells events out of order, or it might seem to them that this translation of the Bible is full of errors. For these languages, the correct thing to do is to put the events in the order in which they happened, or to indicate in some other way that the events are being told in a different order than the order that they normally expect.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>But then Herod ... had John locked up in prison. Now it came about, while all the people were being baptized by John, that Jesus also was baptized. (Luke 3:20-21)

This can sound like John baptized Jesus and the people while he was in prison, but it actually happened earlier. 

>Just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets… But Joshua commanded the people, saying, "Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout."  (Joshua 6:8-10)

This sounds like Joshua gave the order not to shout after the army had already started their march, but it actually happened earlier.

>Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?  (Revelation 5:2)

This sounds like the person should open the scroll and then break the seals that hold it closed. But the seals that lock the scroll must be broken before the scroll can be unrolled.

==== Translation Strategies ====

Here are two ways to fix the problems in the verses above.

  - If your language uses phrases, time words or verb tenses to show that an event happened before the one just mentioned, consider using one of them. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_verbs]])
  - If your language prefers to tell events in the order that they occurred, consider reordering the events so they they are in that order. This may require putting two or more verses together (like 5-6). (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_versebridge]])

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

  * **<sup>20</sup> But then Herod ... had John locked up in prison. <sup>21</sup> Now it came about, while all the people were being baptized by John, that Jesus also was baptized.** (Luke 3:20-21)

1. Using the first strategy, if we add a time phrase to this verse, it can make it clear that the writer is talking about something that happened earlier:
    * <sup>20</sup> But then Herod ... had John locked up in prison. <sup>21</sup> __Before John was put in prison,__ while all the people were being baptized by John, Jesus also was baptized.
2. We do not recommend the second strategy for this passage, because that would require moving verses 21 and 22 before verse 19. The verse bridge would then include 4 verses (19-22), rather than the normal maximum of 3. Also, this would disturb the flow of the narrative, which moves from being about John in verses 1-20 to being about Jesus from verse 21 onward (that is why the events are told out of order). If you still feel that you should reorder verses in a case like this, discuss it with the translation team and decide together if reordering the verses is worth disturbing the original ordering and the flow of the narrative.

  * **<sup>8</sup> Just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets...<sup>10</sup> But Joshua commanded the people, saying, "Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout."**   (Joshua 6:8-10)

1. Using the first strategy, we can translate with a verb tense that makes it clear that Joshua **had commanded** the people not to shout at an earlier time:
    * <sup>8</sup> Just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets...<sup>10</sup> But Joshua __had commanded__ the people, saying, "Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout."
2. Using the second strategy, we can put verse 10 before verse 8, and make a verse bridge of verses 8-10:
    * <sup>8-10</sup> Joshua commanded the people, saying, "Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout." Then just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets… 

  * **Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?** (Revelation 5:2)

1. Using the first strategy, we can use a time word to show that opening the scroll only happens after breaking the seals:
    * "Who is worthy to open the scroll __after__ breaking its seals?"
2. Using the second strategy, we can put the second phrase about breaking the seals first. There is no verse bridge, because both phrases are within the same verse:
    * Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?

=== Examples of Different Logical Ordering ===

Just as with the ordering of events, in some languages it is expected that the arrangement of lists or arguments will be presented in a certain way, according to a logical order.  

The normal ordering of clauses in Romans 1:24 is like this:
    * ><sup>24</sup>  For "the name of God is dishonored among the Gentiles because of you", just as it has been written.
But if in your language causes need to be stated before results (because logically, they come first), then you could reorder this verse like this:
    * ><sup>24</sup>  For just as it has been written, "because of you, the name of God is dishonored among the Gentiles." 

Here is Mark 6:8-9 in the ULB. This is the original ordering. 
    * ><sup>8</sup> and he instructed them to take nothing for their journey but a staff. They should take no bread, no beggar's bag, and no money in their belts, <sup>9</sup> but to wear sandals, and not to wear two tunics.

the UDB has reordered this and made a verse bridge out of verses 8 and 9. It did this because in some languages, it might seem contradictory to say that Jesus told his disciples to take nothing but a staff, but then in the next verse to mention that he wanted them to also wear sandals. So the UDB mentions the things they should take first (sandals and a walking stick), then the things that he did not want them to take.
    * <sup>8-9</sup> He also instructed them to wear sandals and to take along a walking stick when they were traveling. He told them not to take food, nor a bag in which to put supplies, nor any money for their journey. He also did not allow them to take extra clothing.
