They were continually oppressed and tormented \f + \ft Or:People continuously oppressed them and tormented them \f*.
\v 38 \add The people on earth who caused those who trusted in God to suffer were so bad that\add* they did not deserve \add to live with people\add* like those \add who trusted God. Some who trusted God\add* wandered in deserts and mountains. Some lived in caves and in other \add large\add* holes in the ground.

\v 35 Women received their dead by a resurrection: and others were tortured, not accepting their release so that they might obtain a better resurrection:
\v 36 and others had trial of mockings and whippings, yes, even chains and imprisonment:
\v 37 they were stoned, they were sawed in two, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
\v 38 (of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.
