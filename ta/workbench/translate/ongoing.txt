====== Creating Ongoing Translations ======

Bible translations should be ONGOING. Share the translation with others to see if they understand the meaning of the message. Improve your translation with their input. Revising a translation to increase understanding and accuracy is a good idea.

  * Reviewers are needed who can read the translation and point to text that needs revision.
  * Have people read the translation or listen to a recording of the translation. This will help you know if the translation has the same impact in your community that it had among the original audience (for example: giving comfort, encouragement or guidance).
  * Continue to make corrections to the translation that will provide the same meaning as the source text.

Remember, encourage the review of the translation to decide when a revision or new translation is needed. Watch the video for the [[http://youtu.be/kzZp5nawtfo|computer]] or the [[http://youtu.be/NqaiLjIK4BI|portable device]].
