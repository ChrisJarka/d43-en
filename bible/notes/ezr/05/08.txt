\v 8 Let the king know this, that we went to the district of Judah to the house of the Great God, for it was being built with large stones and timber being set in the walls, and this 
work is being done thoroughly so success is in their hands.
\v 9 Then we asked those elders and spoke this to them, ‘Who gave you a judgment to build this house and to complete these walls?’
\v 10 And we also asked them their names so you might know that we could write the name of each vigorous man who were in charge of them.
