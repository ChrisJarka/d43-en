===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul continues giving Titus reasons to preach God's word, and explains how the older men, older women, young men, and slaves or servants should live as believers.

  * **But you, say** - Paul implies what is in contrast. AT: "But you, Titus, in contrast with the false teachers, be sure to say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **with faithful instruction** - "with sound doctrine" or "with correct teachings"
  * **temperate** - "sober-minded" or "self-controlled"
  * **sensible** - "in control of their desires"
  * **sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance** - Here the word "sound" means to be firm and unwavering. The abstract nouns "faith," "love," and "perseverance" can be stated as verbs. AT: "and they must firmly believe the true teachings about God, truly love others, and continually serve God even when things are difficult" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
