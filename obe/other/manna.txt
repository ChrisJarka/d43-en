====== manna ======

===== Definition: =====

Manna was a thin bread-like food that God provided the Israelites in the wilderness after they left Egypt.

  * Manna was provided each morning on the ground under the dew. There was just enough for each person.
  * On the day before the Sabbath, the Israelites were to gather twice the amount so that there would be no gathering on the Sabbath.
