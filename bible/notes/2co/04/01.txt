<usfm>
\v 1 So, because God has acted so kindly \add toward me\add* enabling \add me to teach\add* this great \add message to people\add*, I never get \add so\add* discouraged \add that I stop teaching it\add*.
\v 2 And I have determined that we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* will be honest \f + \ft litotes \f* in everything that we do. We will not \add do anything that would cause\add* us to be ashamed \add if people found out about it\add*. We never try to deceive \add you with clever arguments, as some other people do\add*. We never \add try to deceive you\add* by changing God's message, \add as those same people do\add*. Instead, we always teach \add people only\add* the truth \add about Christ\add*, and we teach it clearly. Knowing that God is watching what we do, we \add teach his message in an honest way, with the result that\add* no one can \add accuse\add* us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* of being deceitful\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 God gave us this ministry, and so we are not down-hearted.
\v 2 We are careful not to break the law of God, and we have nothing to hide from anyone. We do not promise something that God may not give, and we do not twist God's message to make it say what we want. We proclaim only the truth. We present ourselves to be judged by you as we stand before God.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 Therefore, having this ministry just as we have received mercy, we do not become discouraged.
\v 2 But we have renounced the ways that are shameful and hidden. We do not live by craftiness and we do not deliberately mishandle the word of God, but by showing the truth, we commend ourselves to everyoneâ€™s conscience in the sight of God.
