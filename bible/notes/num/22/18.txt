\v 18 And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.
\v 19 Now therefore, I pray you, wait you also here this night, that I may know what Jehovah will speak to me more.
\v 20 And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men are come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to thee, that shall you do.
