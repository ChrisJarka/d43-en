\v 22 Over the head of the living creatures was what looked like an expansive dome; it looked like an awe-inspiring crystal stretched out over their heads above.
\v 23 Beneath the dome, each one of the creature's wings touched another creature's wings. Each of the living creatures also had a pair to cover themselvesâ€”each had a pair to cover their own bodies.
