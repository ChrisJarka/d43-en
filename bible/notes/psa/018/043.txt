\v 43 You will resue me from a hostile army;
\q You have made me the head over the nations:
\q A people that I have not known will serve me.

\v 44 When they hear of me they will obey me;
\q The foreigners will submit themselves to me.
\q
\v 45 Foreigners will lose courage,
\q They shake with fear as they leave their strongholds.
