\v 9 And you, Solomon my son, know you the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for
Jehovah searcheth all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the youghts: if you seek him, he will be found of
you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off for ever.
\v 10 Take heed now; for Jehovah has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.
