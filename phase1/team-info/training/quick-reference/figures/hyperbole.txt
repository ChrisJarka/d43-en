====== Hyperbole ======

===== Description =====

A hyperbole is an **exaggeration** that is used to show the speaker's feeling or opinion about something. It is not meant to deceive, but to make an impression.

The tA page for hyperbole is also used for **generalizations**. This is when a speaker uses words like "every" or "all" to mean something like "very many," but not "every single one." 

When writing notes, tell whether it is an exaggeration or generalization, so that the MTT will know what part of the tA page to look at.

**Translation Strategies for Generalizations**  \\
(I will add these to the tA page. We do not need to write these strategies in the notes, but we can use them to help us write ATs.)
  * Keep the generalization (all, none, always, never, etc.)
  * Use a word or phrase means "most" or "almost."
  * Simply refer to the group or time period without indicating how much of it is included.

===== Template =====

The following information should be included in the notes:

  - **Text** - the text that includes the hyperbole from the ULB in bold
  - Clarifying translation - (optional)
  - **Explanation** - the meaning of the hyperbole unless clear in the alternate translation
  - **Alternate translation** - if not clear from the explanation
  - **TA link** - unless already in the notes for the chunk

  * **(1) ULB text**  - **(3)** Explanation. **(4)** Alternate translation **(5)**  (See: Hyperbole)
===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.

=== Matthew 23:24 (exaggeration) ===
You blind guides, you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!

  * **(1) but swallow a camel**  - **(3)**  This is a an exaggeration. A camel cannot fall into a person's drink, and a person cannot swallow a camel. Its purpose is to show that the religious leaders were doing something extremely foolish. **(4)**  AT: "but swallow something very large that has fallen into the drink" **(5)**  (See: Hyperbole)


===Psalms 58:10 (exaggeration) ===
The righteous will rejoice when he sees God's vengeance;
he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked,

  * **(1) he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked** - **(3)** The great number of wicked people who die is expressed by using the exaggeration of righteous people washing their feet in the wicked people's blood. **(4)** AT: "So many wicked people will die that when the righteous march on their blood, it will seem as if they could wash their feet in it" **(5)** (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])

(This example is complicated because it also has washing the feet as a metaphor for getting the feet wet when trampling on the blood. There is also a note for that.)

===Mark 1:5 (generalization)=== 
The whole country of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. 

  * ** (1) The whole country of Judea** - **(3)** This represents the people of the country of Judea. The word "whole" is a generalization meaning "most" **(4)** AT: "all the people of the country of Judea" or "most people of the country of Judea" or "the people of the country of Judea" **(5)** (See: Hyperbole)

  * ** (1) all the people of Jerusalem** - **(3)** The word "all" is a generalization meaning "most." **(4)** AT: "most of the people of Jerusalem" or "the people of Jerusalem" **(5)** (See: Hyperbole)

===1 Kings 16:16-17 (generalization)===
So that day in the camp, all Israel declared Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel. Omri went up from Gibbethon and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.

  * **(1) all Israel** - (3) Both times this phrases it used, it represents the army of Israel. Here the word "all" is a generalization meaning "most." (4) AT: "all the army of Israel" or "most of the soldiers in the army of Israel" or "the army of Israel" (5) (See: Synecdoche and Hyperbole)
