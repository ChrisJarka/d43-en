======  Matthew 11 General Notes ======


**Formatting in this chapter**\\

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of verses 10 and 17, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

Some scholars believe that verse 20 begins a new stage in the ministry of Christ because of Israel's rejection of him. A new section title is suggested here.

**Special concepts in this chapter**\\

== Hidden revelation ==

After verse 20, Jesus begin to reveal information about himself and about the plans of God the Father while hiding this information from those who reject him (see: [[:en:bible:notes:mat:12:24|12:25]]).

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===
== Near ==
This phrase can have great theological significance. Scholars often debate whether the "kingdom of heaven" was present at this time or still coming. English translations frequently use the phrase "at hand" but this can create difficulty in translating its meaning properly. Other translations use the phase "is drawing near" and "has come near." In Greek, the word is defined as "to move closer."
