\v 20 At that time Yahweh will hire the king of Assyria to come with his army from east of the Euphrates River. They will get rid of everything in your land—the crops and the people. They will destroy everything thoroughly; it will be like a barber shaving not only a man's hair but his beard and the hair on his legs.
\v 21 When that happens, a farmer will be able to keep alive only one young cow and two goats.
\v 22 However, those animals will give plenty of milk, with the result that the farmer will have curds to eat. And because there will not be many people left in the land, all the people who remain there will have plenty of milk and honey.

\q1
\v 22 and because of the abundance of milk which they shall give, he will eat curds,

  * **curds and honey** - This expression implies that the land has been devastated by a foreign nation and food is scarce. The curds are a milk product and honey is produced by bees. This food would still be available even though their crops are destroyed. See how this was translated in 7:15
