====== Biblical weights ======

===== Definition: =====

The following terms are the most common units of weight in the Bible.. The term "shekel" meant "weight" and many other weights are described in terms of the shekel. All of these weights became used for money.

  * Gerah (1/20 of a shekel)
  * Bekah<font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>(1/2 shekel)</font>
  * Pim<font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>(2/3 shekel)</font>
  * <font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Shekel (11 grams of gold or silver)</font>
  * <font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Mina (50 shekels)</font>
  * Talent (60 minas,3000 shekels)

There are different ways to translate Biblical units for measuring weights:

  - <font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible.</font> Then give the equivalent value using a unit of measure that is known to the receptor culture. This explanation could be put in the text or in a note.
  - An important reason for using words that closely resemble the Biblical terms for measuring weights is to show that the Bible is an historical document and that real people used these units of measurement during that time period.
  - If it doesn't work to use the Biblical term, then instead, the equivalent distance or length in terms of a unit of measure that is known to the receptor culture can be used.
