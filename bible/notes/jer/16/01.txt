====== Jeremiah 16:1-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message. He said to me,
\v 2 "Do not get married and have children in this land,
\v 3 because this is what I, Yahweh, say about the children who are born in this city, and about their mothers and fathers:
\v 4 Many of them will die from terrible diseases. And no one will mourn for them. No one will even bury their corpses; the corpses will lie on the ground, scattered like manure. Others will die in wars or from hunger, and then their corpses will become food for vultures and wild animals."

\c 16
\p
\v 1 The word of Jehovah came also to me, saying,
\v 2 You shall not take you a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters, in this place.
\v 3 For thus says Jehovah concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their
mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that became the father of them in this land:
\v 4 They shall die grievous deaths: they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the
face of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds
of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.
