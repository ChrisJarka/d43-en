\v 3 Knowing that Yahweh God \add who created\add* the heavens and the earth is listening, promise that you will not get a wife for my son, Isaac, from the daughters of the Canaan people-group among whom I am now living.

\v 2  Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, that was in charge of all that he had, "Put your hand
under my thigh:
\v 3 and I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.
\v 4 But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
