\v 17 When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will you that I release to you? Barabbas, or
Jesus who is called Christ?
\v 18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.
\v 19 And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have you nothing to do with that
righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
