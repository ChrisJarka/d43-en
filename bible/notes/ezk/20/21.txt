<usfm> \v 21 But the children rebelled against me. They did not walk in my statues or keep my judgements by doing them that if a man does them he will live by them. They profaned my Sabbaths, so I determined to pour out my fury upon them to fulfill my wrath against them in the wilderness. \v 22 But I turned my hand away and acted for my nameâ€™s sake so it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I brought them out. </usfm>
