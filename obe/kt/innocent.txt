====== innocent ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "innocent" means to not be guilty of a crime or other wrongdoing that a person is accused of.

  * A person accused of doing something wrong is innocent if he has not committed that wrong.
  * Jesus is the only human being who was completely innocent, because he never did anything wrong. He was sinless.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "innocent" could also be translated as "not guilty (of the crime)" or "having done nothing wrong (to deserve being punished)."
  * If possible, it is best to translate "sinless" and "innocent" differently. The term "innocent" is usually used in the context of not being guilty of something that one is accused of. The term "sinless" means to have never sinned (which is only true of Jesus).
  * The frequently occurring idiom, "innocent blood" could be translated as, "people who did nothing wrong to deserve being killed."
  * Depending on the context, other ways to translate "innocent" could include, "pure" or "unsuspecting of evil" or "not mixed up in evil."
