<usfm>
\v 26 Then Yahweh of Hosts will wield a whip against them, like when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb. He will raise his rod over the sea and lift it up as he did in Egypt.
\v 27 In that day,
\q1 his burden is lifted from your shoulder and his yoke from off your
neck, 
\q1 and the yoke will be destroyed because your neck will be too fat for it.
