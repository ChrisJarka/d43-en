**[[:en:obe:kt:jesus|Jesus]]** answered, “**You have said so**, but **my [[:en:obe:other:kingdom-of-god|kingdom]] is not an earthly [[:en:obe:other:kingdom|kingdom]]**. If it were, **my [[:en:obe:other:servant|servants]] would fight for me**. I have come to earth to tell the **[[:en:obe:kt:true|truth]]** about **[[:en:obe:kt:god|God]]**. Everyone who **[[:en:obe:kt:love|loves]]** the truth **listens to me**.” **[[:en:obe:other:pilate|Pilate]]** said, “**What is truth?**”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You have said so** - That is, “You have spoken correctly."
  * **my kingdom is not an earthly kingdom** - That is, “my kingdom is not like earthly kingdoms.” 
  * **my servants would fight for me** - That is, “my disciples would fight to protect me” so that I could establish my kingdom. 
  * **listens to me** – This could be translated as, “hears my teaching and obeys me.” It includes not just hearing Jesus' words, but also doing what he says.
  * **What is truth?** - that is, “Can anyone know what is true?”
