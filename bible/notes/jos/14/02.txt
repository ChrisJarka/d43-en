Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. \add Half of the tribe descended from Manasseh was allotted land on the east side of the Jordan, along with the tribes of Reuben and Gad\add*. The people belonging to the nine and a half other tribes \add on the west side of the Jordan River\add* threw lots\f + \ft Or: stones that had been marked \f* to decide which land each tribe would receive.

\v 2 by the lot of their inheritance, as Jehovah commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
\v 3 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan: but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
\v 4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their cattle and for their substance.
\v 5 As Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land.
