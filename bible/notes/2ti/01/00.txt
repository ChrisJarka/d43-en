====== 2 Timothy 01 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Spiritual children ==

Paul call Timothy his son. Paul was very involved in discipling Timothy in his faith. Therefore he called him his “spiritual” son.


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Persecution ==
It is implicit that both Paul and Timothy are suffering persecution when this letter was written. Paul takes the time to encourage Timothy in the midst of these difficulties. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
