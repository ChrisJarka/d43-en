\v 6 And it came about, when God commanded the man dressed in linen and said, "Take fire from between the wheels that are between
the cherubim;" that the man went in and stood beside a wheel.
\v 7 A cherub reached out his hand between the cherubim to the fire that was among the cherubim, and lifted it up and placed
