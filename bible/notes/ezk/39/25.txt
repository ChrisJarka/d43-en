\v 25 Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house
of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name.
\v 26 And they shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell
securely in their land, and none shall make them afraid;
\v 27 when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemiesâ€™ lands, and am sanctified in them
in the sight of many nations.
