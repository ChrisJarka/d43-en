\v 4 Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray to Jehovah your God according to your
words; and it shall come to pass that whatever thing Jehovah shall answer you, I will declare it to you; I will keep
nothing back from you.
\v 5 Then they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah be a true and faithful witness among us, if we do not according to all the word
wherewith Jehovah your God shall send you to us.
\v 6 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be
well with us, when we obey the voice of Jehovah our God.
