**Patterns in Biblical imagery**

**1. Patterned metaphors and similes**

As in languages everywhere, most metaphors and similes in Biblical Hebrew and Greek fall into broad patterns that are unique to those languages. It is very useful to recognize these patterns, because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will always be ready to meet them anywhere.

The surface manifestations of the Biblical metaphors often obscure their underlying structures from the reader. What follows is a list of some of the prominent underlying structural metaphors in the Old Testament, together with examples of their actual textual manifestations. Note that some expressions combine two or more underlying metaphors.
