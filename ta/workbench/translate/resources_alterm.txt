===== Alternate Meaning(s) =====

Alternate **meanings** refer to 
  * When there are multiple ways to express something
  * When there are different understandings of what the word or phrase means. 
 
The explanation of the ULB text starts with the words "Possible meanings are" and number the translation suggestions with the preferred meaning first. If the meaning is given as an explanation, it is not in quotes. 
  * **You are like a young lion ... like a monster in the seas** - Possible meanings are that 1) he was like a lion and a monster or 2) he thought he was like a lion, but he was really only a monster.

  * **like a monster in the seas** - Possible meanings are that 1) he was powerful or 2) he was not doing anything important.

If the meaning is given in a way that can be used as a translation, it is in quotes. 

  * **fell down at Jesus' knees**  - Possible meanings are 1) "bowed down at Jesus' feet" or 2) "lay down on the ground at Jesus' feet" or 3) "knelt down before Jesus." Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus.
