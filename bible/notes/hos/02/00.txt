=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

This chapter break creates an abrupt change of address.The prophet is now addressing the children directly in the first few verses but the whole chapter is written against Gomer as a type for Israel as an adulteress people. In some fashion, God has set Gomer up as a type to show the people of Israel how they are treat Him as their God.
