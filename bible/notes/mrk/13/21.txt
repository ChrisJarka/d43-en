\v 21-22 At that time people will falsely say that they are myself, Christ. And some will appear claiming to be prophets from God. Then they will perform many kinds of miracles. They will even try to deceive the people whom God has chosen. So at that time if someone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!', or if someone says, 'Look, there he is!', do not believe it!
\v 23 Be alert! Remember that I have warned you about all this before it happens!

<usfm>
\v 21 Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there he is!', do not believe it.
\v 22 For false Christs and false prophets will appear and will give signs and wonders, so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
\v 23 Be on guard! I have told you all these things ahead of time.
