**What is “Genesis”?**

“Genesis” means “in the beginning,” and answers the question: where do we come from? Genesis is the account of how God brought creation into existence out of nothing. The story of creation tells us that God made a perfect home for man where he would reveal himself to human beings. 

**What is Genesis about?**

Much of Genesis is about how human beings were made by God and the purpose of human life.  God relates to us and to all creation through [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenants]] that he has made. Human beings are different from animals because God gave us some of his qualities and abilities (Gen. 1:27).\\

Genesis is a record of God’s mighty acts, the beginning of human life, and how [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] brought [[:en:obe:kt:death|death]] and separation between people and God. Yet Genesis gives us hope and tells us about God’s ultimate promise to [[:en:obe:kt:save|save]] us. (Gen. 3:15ff). 

**Who wrote Genesis?**

The Bible tells us that Moses is the author of Genesis. The writers of both the Old and New Testament confirm his authorship. (See: Matthew 19:4, Matthew 24:37–38 and John 5:45¬–46.) Ultimately, one can say that God is the author of Genesis because he inspired Moses’s writings.

**What are the different parts of Genesis?**\\

Genesis Chapters 1–11 is an account of the early years of creation. It tells about Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the Flood, the Tower of Babel, and the beginnings of the different ethnic groups. It very briefly records significant events occurring over a period of several thousand years.\\

Genesis Chapters 12–50 focuses on the special relationship God began with Abraham and his descendants. God established a covenant that contained certain promises for Abraham and his descendants. It is on the foundation of this covenant that Abraham’s descendants, who would be known as the Hebrews or Israelites, would come to worship Yahweh. The longest section in Genesis is about Joseph, one of Jacob’s sons, who is the key figure in Chapters 38–50.  Genesis ends with Abraham’s descendants enslaved in Egypt. \\

**What does "this is the record about" mean?**


The phrase, “this is the record about…” is used repeatedly by Moses to introduce certain subjects into his narrative. The information in these sections came perhaps from sources much older than Moses himself. This phrase, “this is the record about…,” is found in Gen. 5:1; 10:1; 11:10; 25:12; and 36:1.
