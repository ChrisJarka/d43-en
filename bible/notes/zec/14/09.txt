\v 10 At that time, all the land in Judah will become like the desert plain along the Jordan, from the town of Geba in the north to the town of Rimmon far to the south of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will remain raised up like it has always been. It will extend from the Benjamin Gate and the First Gate northeast to the Tower of Hananel, and to the king's winepresses to the southwest.
\v 11 Many people will live there, and the city will never be destroyed again. It will be a safe city.

\v 9 Yahweh will be king over all the earth! In that day it will be Yahweh alone and his name alone!

\v 10 All the land will be like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem will be lifted up and inhabit her place, from Benjamin’s gate to the place of the first gate, now the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses.
\v 11 The people will live in Jerusalem, and their total destruction will no longer continue; Jerusalem will live in safety!
