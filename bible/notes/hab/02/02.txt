\q1
\v 3 In this vision \add I will be talking about things that will happen\add* in the future.

\v 2 And Jehovah answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.
\v 3 For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hastens toward the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for
it; because it will surely come, it will not delay.
