    * **has not withheld his hand from destroying** - AT: "He has not refrained from destroying" or "He has destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
    * **he has made the ramparts lament and the walls become feeble** - The ramparts (outer, defensive walls) and the inner main walls of Jerusalem are like a person who who weeps and grows weak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
