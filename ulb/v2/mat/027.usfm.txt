\p
\v 1 Now when morning was come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to
death:
\v 2 and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor.
\p
\v 3 Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of
silver to the chief priests and elders,
\v 4 saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see you
to it.
\v 5 And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.
\v 6 And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the
price of blood.
\v 7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.
\v 8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, to this day.
\v 9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver,
the price of him that was priced, whom certain of the children of Israel did price;
\v 10 and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.
\p
\v 11 Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said
to him, You sayest.
\v 12 And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
\v 13 Then says Pilate to him, Hearest you not how many things they witness against thee?
\v 14 And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marveled greatly.
\v 15 Now at the feast the governor was wont to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.
\v 16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
\v 17 When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will you that I release to you? Barabbas, or
Jesus who is called Christ?
\v 18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.
\v 19 And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have you nothing to do with that
righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
\v 20 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
\v 21 But the governor answered and said to them, Which of the two will you that I release to you? And they said, Barabbas.
\v 22 Pilate says to them, What then shall I do to Jesus who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.
\v 23 And he said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.
\v 24 So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands
before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; see you
to it.
\v 25 And all the people answered and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.
\v 26 Then released he to them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.
\p
\v 27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered to him the whole band.
\v 28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
\v 29 And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before
him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
\v 30 And they spat upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.
\v 31 And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify
him.
\p
\v 32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go
with them, that he might bear his cross.
\p
\v 33 And when they were come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull,
\v 34 they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.
\v 35 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots;
\v 36 and they sat and watched him there.
\v 37 And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\v 38 Then are there crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.
\v 39 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,
\v 40 and saying, You that destroy the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if you are the Son of God,
come down from the cross.
\v 41 In like manner also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,
\v 42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will
believe on him.
\v 43 He trusts on God; let him deliver him now, if he desires him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
\v 44 And the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach.
\p
\v 45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
\v 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why
have you forsaken me?
\v 47 And some of them that stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calls Elijah.
\v 48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to
drink.
\v 49 And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.
\v 50 And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
\v 51 And behold, the veil of the temple was tore in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks
were rent;
\v 52 and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised;
\v 53 and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.
\v 54 Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were
done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
\v 55 And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him:
\v 56 among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
\p
\v 57 And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:
\v 58 this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.
\v 59 And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
\v 60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb,
and departed.
\v 61 And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
\p
\v 62 Now on the morrow, which is the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered
together to Pilate,
\v 63 saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.
\v 64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away,
and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.
\v 65 Pilate said to them, You have a guard: go, make it as sure as you can.
\v 66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.
