=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== The death of Jeroboam's son ==
God knows the truth, it is useless to try to fool God's prophet. Jeroboam's son became sick; so he sent his wife disguised as a common woman to the prophet who told him he would become king.  The prophet was blind with age but when Jeroboam's wife arrived he told her "Come in, wife of Jeroboam." He also told her that her son would die and all of Jeroboam's family would be killed because he had caused Israel to sin by worshipping the golden calves.

== Rehoboam's reign ==
When Solomon obeyed God, God  made him very rich. Now when the people of Judah began to worship the fertility goddess, Ashtoreth and to do many evil things they had to give all that wealth to the king of Egypt to persuade him not to attack Jerusalem.
