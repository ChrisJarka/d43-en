\v 16 And they forsook all the commandments of Jehovah their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an
Asherah, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
\v 17 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold
themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
\v 18 Therefore Jehovah was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of
Judah only.
