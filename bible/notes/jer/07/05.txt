<usfm>
\v 5 For if you completely make your ways and practices good; if you completely execute justice between a man and his neighbor—
\v 6 if you do not exploit the one staying in the land, the orphan, or the widow and do not pour out innocent blood in this place, and do not walk after other gods to your own harm— 
\v 7 then I will let you stay in this place, in the land that I gave to your ancestors from ancient times and forever.
