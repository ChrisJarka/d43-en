\c 11
\q
\v 1 A false balance is an abomination to Jehovah;
\q But a just weight is his delight.
\q
\v 2 When pride comes, then comes shame;
\q But with the lowly is wisdom.
\q
\v 3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them;
\q But the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.
\q
\v 4 Riches profit not in the day of wrath;
\q But righteousness delivers from death.
\q
\v 5 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way;
\q But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
\q
\v 6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them;
\q But the treacherous shall be taken in their own iniquity.
\q
\v 7 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish;
\q And the hope of iniquity perisheth.
\q
\v 8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble;
\q And the wicked comes in his stead.
\q
\v 9 With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor;
\q But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered.
\q
\v 10 When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth;
\q And when the wicked perish, there is shouting.
\q
\v 11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted;
\q But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
\q
\v 12 He that despises his neighbor is void of wisdom;
\q But a man of understanding holds his peace.
\q
\v 13 He that goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets;
\q But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter.
\q
\v 14 Where no wise guidance is, the people falleth;
\q But in the multitude of counselors there is safety.
\q
\v 15 He that is surety for a stranger shall hurt for it;
\q But he that hates suretyship is secure.
\q
\v 16 A gracious woman obtains honor;
\q And violent men obtain riches.
\q
\v 17 The merciful man does good to his own soul;
\q But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.
\q
\v 18 The wicked earneth deceitful wages;
\q But he that sows righteousness has a sure reward.
\q
\v 19 He that is stedfast in righteousness shall attain to life;
\q And he that pursueth evil does it to his own death.
\q
\v 20 They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to Jehovah;
\q But such as are perfect in their way are his delight.
\q
\v 21 Though hand join in hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished;
\q But the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
\q
\v 22 As a ring of gold in a swineâ€™s snout,
\q So is a fair woman that is without discretion.
\q
\v 23 The desire of the righteous is only good;
\q But the expectation of the wicked is wrath.
\q
\v 24 There is that scattereth, and increases yet more;
\q And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth
only to want.
\q
\v 25 The liberal soul shall be made fat;
\q And he that watereth shall be watered also himself.
\q
\v 26 He that withholdeth grain, the people shall curse him;
\q But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.
\q
\v 27 He that diligently seeks good seeks favor;
\q But he that searcheth after evil, it shall come to him.
\q
\v 28 He that trusts in his riches shall fall;
\q But the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf.
\q
\v 29 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind;
\q And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.
\q
\v 30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life;
\q And he that is wise winneth souls.
\q
\v 31 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth;
\q How much more the wicked and the sinner!
