\q
\v 16 So everyone who consumes you will be consumed, and all of your adversaries will go into captivity.
\q For the ones who have plundered you will become plunder, and I will make all of the ones despoiling you a spoil.
\q
\v 17 For I will bring healing on you; I will heal you of your wounds—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\q I will do this because they called you: Outcast. No one cares for this Zion.'"
