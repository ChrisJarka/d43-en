\v 1 So, because God has acted so kindly \add toward me\add* enabling \add me to teach\add* this great \add message to people\add*, I never get \add so\add* discouraged \add that I stop teaching it\add*.
\v 2 And I have determined that we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* will be honest \f + \ft litotes \f* in everything that we do. We will not \add do anything that would cause\add* us to be ashamed \add if people found out about it\add*. We never try to deceive \add you with clever arguments, as some other people do\add*. We never \add try to deceive you\add* by changing God's message, \add as those same people do\add*. Instead, we always teach \add people only\add* the truth \add about Christ\add*, and we teach it clearly. Knowing that God is watching what we do, we \add teach his message in an honest way, with the result that\add* no one can \add accuse\add* us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* of being deceitful\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 We have received this ministry in the same way that we received God's mercy, and so we are cannot become discouraged
\v 2 We are careful about how we conduct our ministry: we renounce any methods that shame pushes along or that are questionable in motives that are behind them. We use forthright, honest speech, and do no employ the schemes of craftiness to win people. We are careful how we teach the word of God and we do not deliberately twist its message to fit those we are teaching, instead we proclaim the truth in every situation. We do this because it is God's evaluation of our work that matters the most, we know God sees all we do and we are accountable to him.

\v 1 Therefore, having this ministry just as we have received mercy, we do not become discouraged.
\v 2 But we have renounced the ways that are shameful and hidden. We do not live by craftiness and we do not deliberately mishandle the word of God, but by showing the truth, we commend ourselves to everyoneâ€™s conscience in the sight of God.
