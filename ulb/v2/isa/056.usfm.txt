\c 56
\p
\v 1 Thus says Jehovah, Keep you justice, and do righteousness; for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be
revealed.
\v 2 Blessed is the man that does this, and the son of man that holds it fast; that keeps the sabbath from profaning it,
and keeps his hand from doing any evil.
\v 3 Neither let the foreigner, that has joined himself to Jehovah, speak, saying, Jehovah will surely separate me from his
people; neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.
\v 4 For thus says Jehovah of the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast my
covenant:
\v 5 To them will I give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will
give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
\p
\v 6 Also the foreigners that join themselves to Jehovah, to minister to him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be his
servants, every one that keeps the sabbath from profaning it, and holds fast my covenant;
\v 7 even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their
sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.
\v 8 The Lord Jehovah, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, saith, Yet will I gather
others to him, besides his own that are gathered.
\p
\v 9 All you beasts of the field, come to devour, youa, all you beasts in the forest.
\v 10 His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; dreaming, lying down,
loving to slumber.
\v 11 Yea, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough; and these are shepherds that cannot understand: they have all
turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter.
\v 12 Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to-morrow shall be as
this day, a day great beyond measure.
