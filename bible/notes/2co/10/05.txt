\v 5 \add Specifically\add*, I show that the \add human\add* arguments that they use to deceive \add people are completely wrong\add*. When they \add proudly say things that\add* keep other people from knowing God, \add I show them that they are completely wrong. I also enable people to\add* change their ways of thinking so that they think about everything as Christ \add wants them to think\add*.
\v 6 I am also ready to discipline everyone \add among you\add* who has not obeyed \add the things that Christ taught. I will do this\add* as soon as you \add who truly want to obey Christ show me that\add* you are \add going to\add* obey him completely.

\v 5 With God's power we can destroy the arguments that would accuse us, and we can oppose every impressive opinion that the world holds high and we can put it up against the knowlege that God gives us, and we defeat every thought and bring them captive to Christ,
\v 6 and we are ready to punish every infraction of God's rule, while we labor to bring you obedience to completion.
