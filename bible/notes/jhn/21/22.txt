\v 22 Jesus says to him, If I will that he wait till I come, what
is that to thee? follow you me.
\v 23 This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not to him, that
he should not die; but, If I will that he wait till I come, what
is that to thee?
