\v 29 There were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died childless;
\v 30 and the second:
\v 31 and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.
\v 32 Afterward the woman also died.
\v 33 In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her as wife."
