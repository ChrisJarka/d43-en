\v 24 But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and does according to all the
abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered: in
his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them shall he die.
