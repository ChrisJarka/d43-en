====== with my whole heart, with all my heart ======

===== Description =====

Depending on the context, the Hebrew word often translated as "heart" can refer to either the mind or the seat of emotions. 

In some languages, the meaning of "with my whole heart" and "with all my heart" would not be expressed referring with a body part but with an adverb.

===== Standard Notes =====

(Replace the word "[person's]" with the appropriate pronoun.)

  * **with all [person's] heart**  - This means "sincerely" or "in a deeply felt way." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

  * **with [person's] whole heart** - This means "sincerely" or "in a deeply felt way" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
