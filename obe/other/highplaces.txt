====== high places ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "high places" refers to places on the top of hills or mountains where idol worship altars were built and used.

  *  These altars to idols may have been built on higher ground in order to be closer to where the false gods were thought to live.
  * Israel sinned against God by building altars on high places and worshiping idols on them.
  * When a God-fearing king took office in Israel, a common practice for him was to remove the high places and abolish idol worship.
  * Many kings did not remove the high places and this resulted in Israel being deeply involved in idol worship.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Other ways to translate this term could include, "elevated places for idol worship" or "hilltop idol shrines" or "idol altar mounds."
