\c 3
\p
\v 1 And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ.
\v 2 I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you were not yout able
to bear it: nay, not even now are you able;
\v 3 for you are yout carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are you not carnal, and do you not walk after the
manner of men?
\v 4 For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are you not men?
\v 5 What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.
\v 6 I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
\v 7 So then neither is he that plants anything, neither he that watereth; but God that gives the increase.
\v 8 Now he that plants and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
\v 9 For we are God’s fellow-workers: you are God’s husbandry, God’s building.
\p
\v 10 According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another builds
thereon. But let each man take heed how he builds thereon.
\v 11 For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
\v 12 But if any man builds on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;
\v 13 each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself
shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is.
\v 14 If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.
\v 15 If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.
\p
\v 16 Know you not that you are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God lives in you?
\v 17 If any man destroys the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.
\p
\v 18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he
may become wise.
\v 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that takes the wise in their craftiness:
\v 20 and again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.
\v 21 Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;
\v 22 whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are
yours;
\v 23 and you are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.
