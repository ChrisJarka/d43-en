\v 19 After hearing these words that Jesus had been saying, the Jews were divided in their opinion of him.
\v 20 Many of them said, "A demon is controlling him and has caused him to become crazy. Do not waste time listening to him!"
\v 21 But others said, "What he is saying is not something a man being oppressed and controlled by a demon would ever say. No demon can open the eyes of a blind man!"

\v 20 And many of them said, He has a demon, and is mad; why hear you him?
\v 21 Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
