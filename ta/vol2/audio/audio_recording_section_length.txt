===== How Much to Record =====

//This page answers the question:// //How long should each narrated section be?//

How long of a section should a team record before stopping to listen and review the recorded section? The answer to this question depends on the experience and skill level of the team. Generally speaking, it is a good idea to try a paragraph, or 2 or 3 sentences, as the length of a section. It is easy to attempt recording long sections, assuming it saves time. This often is not true, unless the narrator has an exceptional level of skill and makes very few errors. Most recording teams will find that keeping sections shorter will help them work steadily through a project making the most efficient use of time and maintaining the best level of attentiveness toward the task, without causing early fatigue for the narrator's voice.

A recording team should begin to develop a good rhythm to their recording process and the ideal length of a recordable section should become obvious.

Here are some clues to watch for that indicate if the sections you are attempting are too long:

  * The narrator is not reading in a relaxed, natural style. Instead they are reading as if straining and hoping to reach a finish line without tripping.
  * The narrator makes many errors pronouncing words.
  * You have multiple errors to fix within that section but you do not discovered that until after spending time fixing the first error. Realizing how many total errors there are, you discover time would have been much better spent simply re-recording. (See module Editing/Decisions: Edit or Re-record).
  * The narrator's throat or voice is becoming fatigued too early in the session.
  * The recordist, narrator or checker becomes lost because the reference points are too far apart between sections.

Here are some clues to watch for that indicate if the sections you are attempting are too short:

  * The narrator is not reading in a relaxed, natural style. Instead they are reading faster or ending sentences and phrases too abruptly.
  * The recordist spends too much time handling the start/stop controls for such small portions. Meanwhile, the narrator and checker begin to lose their focus because progress feels slow and so much time is spent waiting for the recordist. The team loses their sense of being fully engaged together in the process.
