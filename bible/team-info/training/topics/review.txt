====== Review of the Materials ======

When using a "crowd-sourced" approach to the development of content, it is necessary to understand the strengths and the limitations of that process. The strengths include:

  * a large number of people can participate
  * the crowd can work anytime and anywhere at their disgression
  * a large volume of content can be produced very quickly 

Weaknesses of the crowd approach include

  * it is messy to administer
  * the crowd may not be able to reach consensus on all points
  * the content may not be completely accurate, depending on "who had it last"
