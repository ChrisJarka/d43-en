\v 17 And there shall cleave nothing of the devoted thing to your hand; that Jehovah may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show you mercy, and have compassion upon you, and multiply you, as he has sworn to your fathers;
\v 18 when you shall listen to the voice of Jehovah your God, to keep all his commandments which I command you this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah your God.
