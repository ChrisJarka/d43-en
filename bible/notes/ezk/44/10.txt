====== Ezekiel 44:10-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 10 Many of the descendants of Levi deserted me along with most of the Israelite people, and started to worship idols. They must be punished for their sin. \v 11 They are permitted to work in my temple and to be in charge of the gates of the temple, and they are permitted to slaughter the animals that will be completely burned on the altar, and to burn other sacrifices for the people, and they will be able to help the people. \v 12 But because they helped the people to worship idols and caused many of the people of Israel to sin \add by worshiping idols\add*, I have lifted up my arm and solemnly declared that they must be punished for their sin. </usfm>

<usfm> \v 10 Yet the Levites who went far from me when Israel wandered away, who wandered away from me after their idols, now they will lift up their iniquity \v 11 and they will be ministers in my sanctuary, watching the gates of the house and ministering in the house. They will slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice of the people and they will stand before them to minister to them. \v 12 Because they ministered to them before their idols and they became stumbling blocks of iniquity for the house of Israel, therefore I will lift up my hand against them—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—so they will lift up their iniquity! </usfm>
