===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 The \add Jewish\add* high priest enters the very holy place once every year, taking blood that is not his own, \add to offer it as a sacrifice\add*. But when Christ entered heaven, it was not in order to offer himself repeatedly like that.
\v 26 \add If that were so\add*, he would have needed to suffer \add and shed his blood\add* repeatedly since \add the time when God\add* created the world. But instead, in this final age, \add Christ\add* has appeared once in order that by sacrificing himself he could cause \add that people\add* no longer will be \add punished for their\add* sins.

\v 26 If that were so, he would have needed to suffer and shed his blood repeatedly since the time when God created the world. But instead, in this final age, Christ has appeared once so that by sacrificing himself all our sins can be forgiven and the condemnation we deserve for our sin is removed.

\v 25 Not that he should offer himself often, as the high priest did who enters into the very holy place year by year with another's blood. 
\v 26 Because then it would have been necessary for him to have suffered frequently since the beginning of the world. But now once at the end of the ages has he been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
