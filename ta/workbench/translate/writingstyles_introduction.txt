===== Examples from the Bible =====


===== Translation Strategies =====
  - In most languages new participants are introduced with a clause telling something about them.
  - After that in many languages the participant is referred to with a pronoun where it is clear who is being referred to.
  - In languages where the subject is marked in the verb, many languages do not mark old participants.  

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====\\

 1. In most languages new participants are introduced with a clause telling something about them.\\
  * **Esther 2:6 //There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai.**\\
 2. After that in many languages the participant is referred to with a pronoun where it is clear who is being referred to.\\
  * **__He__ had been taken away from Jerusalem with the exiles** Since Mordecai had already been mentioned, he is referred to here with the pronoun "he". 
 3. In languages where the subject is marked in the verb, many languages do not mark old participants.\\
  * This can not be illustrated with English because English does not mark the subject in the verb.
==== Description: =====
Phrases like “One day” or “It came about that” or “This is how it happened” or “Sometime after that” signal to the reader that a new event is about to be related.

To introduce a new participant into the story, the text might say, “There once was a man who....” or “A certain man was traveling...” Every language has specific ways to communicate these introductions.
