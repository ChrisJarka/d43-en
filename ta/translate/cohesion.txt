Cohesion organizes a text.</font>

Material that is written cohesively helps the reader understand the text. Cohesion helps a reader understand how sentences relate to one another and how they relate to the topic.

Each language has its own patterns to show the different relationships and create cohesion. Specific words and phrases that join sentences together are common tools for increasing cohesion. The use of sequencing or time order is another method to build cohesion. Cause and effect, compare and contrast, and conclusion are other typical techniques for building cohesion.
