\c 61
\d For the Chief Musician; on a stringed instrument. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Hear my cry, O God;
\q Attend to my prayer.
\q
\v 2 From the end of the earth will I call to thee, when my heart is overwhelmed:
\q Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
\q
\v 3 For you have been a refuge for me,
\q A strong tower from the enemy.
\q
\v 4 I will dwell in your tabernacle for ever:
\q I will take refuge in the covert of your wings. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 For thou, O God, have heard my vows:
\q You have given me the heritage of those that fear your name.
\q
\v 6 You will prolong the kingâ€™s life;
\q His years shall be as many generations.
\q
\v 7 He shall abide before God for ever:
\q Oh prepare lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
\q
\v 8 So will I sing praise to your name for ever,
\q That I may daily perform my vows.
