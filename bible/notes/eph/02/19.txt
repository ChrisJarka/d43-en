\v 19 So \add God no longer treats\add* you \add non-Jews\add* as \add people treat\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* foreigners and strangers \add who live among them\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Instead, along with all God's people, \add it is as though\add* you have become citizens of a country that he rules over, and \add as though you have become\add* members of the family\add of which he is the father\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 20 \add Just like\add* a building is built \f + \ft Or:\add as someone\add* builds a building \f* on a foundation, \add God has joined you into one group that originated, Or: began\add* from what the apostles and prophets \add taught\add*. Christ Jesus is the \add most important one in that group, just like a\add* cornerstone \add is the most important part of a building\add*. And
\v 21 just like \add a builder might\add* join together all the parts of a building to make it a temple that \add people will\add* dedicate to the Lord \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add Christ is continually causing all of\add* you who have a relationship with \add him to be united, in order that you will become one holy group\add*.
\v 22 And because of your relationship with Christ, \add God\add* is joining you \add non-Jews\add* together with \add Jewish believers\add* to be \add like\add* one building \f + \ft metaphor \f* in which his Spirit lives.

\v 19 Therefore now you non-Jews are no longer strangers and foreigners to God's people, but instead you are fellow members with those set apart for God, and you belong to God's family for whom God is the Father.
\v 20 God's family, his assembly of all believers in the world, is built upon the foundation of the lives and teachings of the apostles and prophets, like a stone building is built upon a solid stone foundation. And Christ Jesus is the most important cornerstone in the foundation of God's family.
\v 21 Jesus is building his family of believers and fitting them together like a temple of stones is built and fit together, increasing as new believers set apart for the Lord are added, as when stones are added to construct a temple.
\v 22 Jesus is building you up together, both Jews and non-Jews, into one family in which his Spirit lives, because God's Spirit lives inside each believer.

\v 19 So then now you Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners, but instead you are fellow-citizens with those set apart for God, those who are members of God's family.
\v 20 These are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.
\v 21 By the power of Jesus the whole building of his family fits together and increases as a temple set apart for the Lord,
\v 22 in whom you also  are being built together into a dwelling place for God in the Spirit.
