\v 14 \add But they did not have the opportunity that you have, so when God punishes people, he will punish the wicked people who lived in\add* Tyre and Sidon, but he will punish you more severely \add because you did not pay attention to my message\add*!
\v 15 \add I also have something to say to\add* you\add people who live in\add* Capernaum \add city\add*.

\v 13 Beware Chorazin![There will be terrible punishment for you people who live in the cities of Chorazin and] Beware Bethsaida! cities! For if the miracles that I performed in your cities had been done in [the cities of ]Tyre and Sidon cities, [the wicked] people who lived there would have long ago shown that they were sorry for their sins by sitting on the ground wearing coarse cloth and putting ashes on their heads.
\v 14 But they did not have the opportunity that you have, so when God judges/punishes people, he will judge/punish the [wicked] people who lived in Tyre and Sidon more tolerably than for you![, but he will punish you more severely because you did not pay attention to my message!]
\v 15 I also have something to say to you people who live in the city of Capernaum city. Some are singing your praises to heaven![Do not you think that you will be honored? [That will not happen!] On the contrary, God will lower you to the place of the dead! [after you die, God will send you to Hades!"]

\v 13 Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
\v 15 And you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you? No, you will be brought down to Hades.
