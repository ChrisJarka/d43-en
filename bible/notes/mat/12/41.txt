\v 41 When \add God\add* judges \add all people\add*, the people who lived in Nineveh will stand \add in front of him\add* with \add you\add* people who \add have seen me perform miracles\add*. The \add people of Nineveh turned from their sinful ways as a result of hearing what\add* Jonah preached. \add Jonah was important, but I\add*, who am more important than Jonah, \add have come and preached to you, but you have not turned from your sinful ways. So\add* when \add God\add* judges \add all people, he\add* will condemn you.

<usfm>
\v 41 When God judges everyone, the people who lived in the city of Nineveh will stand in front of him beside you people. But they stopped sinning when Jonah warned them. Now I have come to you, and I am far more important than Jonah was, but you have not stopped sinning. So God will judge you.
