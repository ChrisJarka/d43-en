<usfm> \v 30 God makes the wild plants very beautiful, but they grow in the field for only a short time. One day they grow, and the next day people will throw them into an oven to bake bread. But you are more important to God than wild plants are, and you live much longer. So trust in God, you who have so little faith! \v 31 So do not worry and say, 'Will we have anything to eat?' or 'Will we have anything to drink?' or 'Will we have clothes to wear?' </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 30 If God so clothes the grass in the fields, which exists today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith? \v 31 Therefore do not be anxious and say, 'What will we eat?' or, 'What will we drink?' or, 'What will we clothe ourselves in?' </usfm>
