\v 8 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of
the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of
the God of Israel thither.
\v 9 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of Jehovah was against the city with a very great
discomfiture: and he struck the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors brake out upon them.
