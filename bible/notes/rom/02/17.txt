\v 17  Now I have something to say to anyone of you Jews to whom I am writing: You trust that God will save you because you know the laws that he gave to Moses. You boast that you belong to God.
\v 18 You know what God desires. Because you have been taught God's laws, you are able to know which things are right and to choose to do them.
\v 19 You are certain that you are able to show  God's truth to non-Jews, and that you can instruct those who know nothing about God.
\v 20  You are certain that by what you say you can show God's way to the non-Jews who do not understand it. You are certain that you can instruct those who believe foolish things about God and those who are like children because they know nothing about him at all. You are certain about all this because you have in the Law what teaches you truly about God.

\p
\v 17 If you call yourself a Jew, rest upon the Law, rejoice proudly in God,
\v 18 know his will, and test the things that differ from it, having been instructed by the Law—
\v 19 if you are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
\v 20 a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, and that you have in the Law the form of knowledge and of the truth—

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * This section should be broken down into individual sentences.
  * **If you call yourself a Jew**  – Paul uses a conditional sentence in order to show the Jews that Paul’s point applies to them. “If you wish to reject what I am saying by pointing to the fact that you are Jewish.” (See: Conditional sentence)
  * **guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness**  – When the Jews taught the ignorant, it was like helping people who could not see so that they would know the way the Jews believed that God wants them to go. (See: Metaphor; also see: Doublet)
  * **a teacher of babies**  - <font 10.5pt line-height: 107% color: rgb(51, 51, 51)/inherit;;rgb(51, 51, 51);;inherit>Jewish teachers complained that they had to teach adults who were completely ignorant of the Law, thus, these learners were like little children. This word for "babies" refers to children of ages 1-4, approximately, not infants. (See: Metaphor)</font>
  * <font 10.5pt line-height: 107% color: rgb(51, 51, 51)/inherit;;rgb(51, 51, 51);;inherit>** the form of knowledge and the truth  ** - "the true knowledge, written in a clear form" (See: Doublet)</font>
