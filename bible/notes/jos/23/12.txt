\v 12 If you turn away from doing what Yahweh desires and you associate with the people who are not Israelites, and if you marry them,
\v 13 then you can be sure that Yahweh our God will not help you to expel those people-groups from your land. They will be \add like\add* traps \f + \ft doublet, metaphor \f* \add that will catch you\add*. They will be like whips \add that strike\add* your backs, and like thorns \add that will scratch\add* your eyes. As a result, none of you will be left in this good land that Yahweh our God is giving to you.

\v 12 Else if you do at all go back, and cleave to the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and make
marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you;
\v 13 know for a certainty that Jehovah your God will no more drive these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a
snare and a trap to you, and a scourge in your sides, and thorns in your eyous, until you perish from off this good land which
Jehovah your God has given you.
