This module answers the question: What is an idiom?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

==== Definition ====

An idiom is a group of words that has a meaning that is different from what one would understand from the meanings of the individual words.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

  * Use the original idiom if it would be clearly understood in your language.
  * Use a different idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.
  * Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>"But I have __a baptism to be baptized with__, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!" -Luke 12:50 (WEB) 

A "baptism to be baptized with" is an idiom for suffering. Jesus meant that he would soon suffer greatly.

>"Moses came near to the camp, and saw the calf and the dancing, and __Moses' nose burned__," -Exo 32:19

"His nose burned" is a Hebrew idiom that means, "He became angry."

>"You are all __sons of__  light, and __sons of__  the day." -1 Thes 5:5a (WEB) 

The phrase “sons of” is a Hebrew idiom used to refer to people who have certain characteristics. Jews used this idiom even when speaking Greek. "Sons of light" refers to people who live according to the truth.

==== Examples from English ====

>"He saw the light."

means "He finally understood."

>"It cost an arm and a leg."

means "It was very expensive."

>"Let's play it by ear."

means "Let's improvise" or "Let's see what happens and make decisions based on that."

>"She had butterflies in her stomach."

means "She was nervous."
