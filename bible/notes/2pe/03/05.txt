\v 5 For this they wilfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the word of God;
\v 6 by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
\v 7 but the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
