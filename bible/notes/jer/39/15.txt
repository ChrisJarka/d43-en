\v 16 "Say this to Ebed-Melech, the official from Ethiopia: 'This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says: I will do to this city everything that I said that I would do.

\v 15 Now the word of Yahweh had come to Jeremiah while he was arrested in the court of the guard, and said,

For this will come before you on this day!
