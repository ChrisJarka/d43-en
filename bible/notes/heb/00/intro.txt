=== What is the Book of Hebrews about? ===

The book of Hebrews is an encouraging letter which shows how Jesus fulfilled several Old Testament prophecies.  It was written like a sermon.  There are over 60 references to the Old Testament in Hebrews which clearly show how Jesus fulfilled prophecy and the duties of the Jewish High Priest.  For this reason the book was meant to be encouraging to Jewish Christians.  Hebrews shows how Jesus completed the Law so that priests won't have to offer sacrifices ever again.  Jesus was the sacrifice for all sins, once and for all time. Christians in our time can also find encouragement in the letter to the Hebrews to keep following Jesus Christ as the one who makes it possible for us to trust in God, and also to keep on trusting in him (12:2).

===Who wrote the Book of Hebrews? ===

No one knows who wrote Hebrews, but scholars have made suggestions such as the Apostle Paul, Luke, or Barnabas.  The date of writing is also not known but most believe it was written before 70 years after the birth of Christ.  Jerusalem was destroyed in 70, but the writer of this letter talks about Jerusalem like it was not yet destroyed.  Hebrews was written in the city of Rome (13:24) and was probably circulated among several churches.
