\v 5 For if you completely make your ways and your practices good; if you completely execute justice between a man and his neighbor--
\v 6 do not exploit the sojourner, the orphan, or the widow and do not pour out innocent blood in this place, and do not walk after other gods to your harm-- 
\v 7 Then I will let you abide in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers from ancient times unto perpetuity!
