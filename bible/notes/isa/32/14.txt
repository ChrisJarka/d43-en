\v 14 The king's palace will be empty;

\q2 in the empty forts and watchtowers.
\q1
\v 15 It will be like that until God pours his Spirit out on us from heaven.
\q2 When that happens, the deserts will become fertile fields,
\q2 and abundant crops will grow in those fertile fields.

<usfm>
\v 14 For the palace will be forsaken, the crowded city will be deserted; the hill and the watch-tower will become dens for
ever, a joy of wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks;
\v 15 until the Spirit be poured on us from on high, and the wilderness become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be
considered  as a forest.
