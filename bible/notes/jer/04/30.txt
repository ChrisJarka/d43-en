<usfm>
\v 30 Now you who are devastated, what will you do? For though you have dressed in scarlet, you have adorned yourself with gold jewelry, you have opened the makeup of your eyes to beautify yourself in vanity; the ones who had lusted for you refuse you. They seek your life!
\v 31 So I hear the sound of anguish, distress as in the birth of a firstborn child, the sound of the daughter of Zion! She gasps for breath! She spreads out her hands, ‘Woe to me! For my soul is tired of the slaughterers!’”
