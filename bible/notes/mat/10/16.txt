===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 16 "Take note: When I send you out, you will be as defenseless as sheep, among people who are as dangerous as wolves. And you must no more harm them than doves would. You should wisely stay away from such people, as snakes stay away from people. \v 17 Also, be on guard against people, because they will arrest you and take you to the members of the religious councils to put you on trial; they will punish you because you are my disciples. They will whip you in their synagogues. \v 18 And because you belong to me, they will take you before governors and kings in order that they may put you on trial and punish you. But you will testify to those rulers and to other non-Jews about me. </usfm>
