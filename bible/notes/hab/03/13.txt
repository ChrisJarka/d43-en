===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Habakkuk continues to describe his vision of Yahweh. The last sentence in this verse is difficult to translate. Read each of the translationNotes on that sentence below to see different ways to translate it.

  * **You went out for the salvation of your people** - The word "salvation" can be translated with a verb. AT: "You went out to save your people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **your anointed one** - "the one whom you have anointed." Here this phrase refers to one whom Yahweh has chosen. Possible meanings are 1) "the people you have chosen" or "the nation you have chosen" or 2) "the king you have chosen."
  * **You shatter the head of the house of the wicked to lay bare from the base up to the neck** - This is the first way to translate this sentence. See the next note for another option. The phrase "the house of the wicked" is a metaphor in which the wicked nation is spoken of as if it were a house. The leader of the wicked nation is spoken of as if he were the head of a house, with the head of a house being a metaphor for the roof of the house. Finally, "the base" refers to the bottom part of a building and "the neck" refers to the top part of the building just below the roof. Shattering the head would then mean to kill the leader of the nation, and laying bare from the base up to the neck would mean to destroy the building, or nation, that he leads. AT: "You destroy the roof of the wicked house and demolish the rest of the building" or "You kill the leader of the wicked nation and completely destroy the nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You shatter the head of the house of the wicked to lay bare from the base up to the neck** - This is the second way to translate this sentence. See the previous note for another option. The word "house" is a metonym for the "family" that lives in the house and here represents a people group. This family is spoken of as if it were a body with the leader being the head of the body. Finally, "the base" refers to the bottom part of the body and "the neck" refers to the part of the body just below the head. Shattering the head would then mean to kill the leader of the wicked people, and laying bare from the base up to the neck would mean to strip the body of clothing, or to completely remove any power or honor from the people whom he leads. AT: "The wicked people and their leader are like a man whose head you crush and whose body you strip naked from foot to neck" or "You kill the leader of the wicked people and completely remove all of the people's power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
