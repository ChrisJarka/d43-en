\v 12 Then the woman said, "Your Majesty, please allow me to say one more thing to you." He replied, "Speak!"
\p
\v 13 The woman said, "Why have you done this bad thing to God's people? You have not allowed your son Absalom to return home. By saying what you have just said, you have certainly declared \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that what you have done is wrong.
\v 14 We all die; we are like \f + \ft simile \f* water that cannot be picked up after it is spilled on the ground. \add After we die, we cannot become alive again\add*. Even God does not cause people who have died to become alive again. \add So Amnon cannot become alive again\add*. But God creates ways for those who have been exiled to be able to return to their homes.

\p
\v 12 Then the woman said, Let your handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
\v 13 And the woman said, Wherefore then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word
the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king does not fetch home again his banished one.
\v 14 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God take
away life, but devises means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him.
