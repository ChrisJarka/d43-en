\q
\v 8 'They will bring the silver and gold to me!'--this is Yahweh of Host's declaration. 
[[I changed this from "pure" possession to the idea of implied transfer TO YHWH by the nations on the basis of v. 7. But I'm open to the more traditional possessive statements.]]
\q
\v 9 'The glory of this house will be greater in the future than at the beginning,' says Yahweh of Hosts, 
\q 'and in this place will I give peace!'--this is Yahweh of Host's declaration."
