<usfm>
\v 6 Yahweh said to Moses, "Put your hand in your robe." Moses put his hand in his robe. When he brought his hand out, it had a disease that made the skin look white as snow.
\v 7 Then Yahweh said, "Put your hand in your robe again." Moses put his hand back inside his robe. This time when he brought it out, the disease was healed, and it looked like his other hand.

\v 6 Yahweh also said  to him, "Put now your hand into your robe." So he put his hand into his robe and when he brought it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.
\v 7 Yahweh said, "Put your hand into your robe again." So he put his hand into his robe again; and when he brought it out of his robe, he saw it was restored again like his other skin.

  * [[:en:obe:kt:restore]]

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **behold, his hand was leprous**  - or "and look, his hand became leprous" or "and instantly, his hand was full of leprosy" 
    * **as white as snow** - This is a [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro]].  Snow is water that comes from very cold rain.   Because the snow is very cold, its consistency is like powdery flakes and is white in color (similar in color to talcum powder that ladies often use to powder their noses).    Sometimes snow is present on the top of very tall mountains even in countries where it never is present in most places.    This verse could easily be translated "as white as talcum powder".   The color white also symbolizes purity and being free from sin and disease.    The "as white as snow" implies the purity of being free from the disease.
