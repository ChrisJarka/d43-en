\v 15 And you were now turned, and had done that which is right in mine eyous, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor;
and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
\v 16 but you turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free
at their pleasure, to return; and you brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.
