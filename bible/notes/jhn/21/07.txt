\v 7 But I knew that it was Jesus, so I said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" Peter had taken off his cloak while he was working, but as soon as he heard me say "It is the Lord!" he wrapped his cloak around himself and jumped into the water and swam to shore.
\v 8 The rest of us came to the shore in the boat, pulling the net full of fish. We were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards.
\v 9 When we got to the shore, we saw that there was a fire of burning coals there, with a large fish on the fire, and some buns.

\v 7 That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
he wrapped his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.
\v 8 But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off),
dragging the net full of fishes.
\v 9 So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
