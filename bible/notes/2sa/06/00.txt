=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem ==
David organized a procession with many musical instruments to bring the Ark to Jerusalem. They put it on a cart; but when the oxen stumbled, Uzzah reached out to steady it so it would not fall. God killed him for touching the Ark. David was angry at God for killing Uzzah and afraid to bring the Ark any further. They put it in house of Obed Edom. God greatly blessed Obed so David decided to bring the Ark the rest of the way to Jerusalem. This time they had Levis carrying the Ark as the Law of Moses had said should be done. David danced for joy in front of the Ark. His wife, Michal, criticized David for uncovering himself as he danced but David did not care.  


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Irony ==
Michal criticized David using biting [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]]: "How honored the king of Israel was today, who undressed himself today before the eyes of the slave girls among his servants, like one of the crude fellows who shamelessly undresses himself!"
