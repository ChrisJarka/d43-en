\q
\v 12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers,
\q In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
\q
\v 13 He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through;
\q And he made the waters to stand as a heap.
\q
\v 14 In the day-time also he led them with a cloud,
\q And all the night with a light of fire.
