\v 1 Thus said Jehovah, Go, and buy a potterâ€™s earthen bottle, and
take of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests;
\v 2 and go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words
that I shall tell thee;
\v 3 and say, Hear you the word of Jehovah, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God
