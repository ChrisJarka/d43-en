\v 3 I looked up and saw a ram that was standing alongside the canal. It had two long horns, but the one that grew last was longer than the one that grew first.
\v 4 The ram butted\f + \ft Or: knocked \f* away \add with its horns\add* everything that was west and everything that was north and everything that was south of it. There were no other animals that were able to oppose it, and none that could rescue\f + \ft Or: save \f* other animals from its power. The ram did whatever it wanted to do and became very powerful.

\v 3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two
horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
\v 4 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any
that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.
