\v 14 But \add they cannot do that, because\add* they are like \f + \ft simile \f* straw that is burning in a fire;
\q2 they cannot save themselves from being burned up in the flames.
\q1 Those men are unable to help you \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 they are as useless as stubble \add that burns quickly and produces no heat\add* for you.
\q1
\v 15 The people whom you have associated with and worked with since you were young
\q2 \add will not help you\add*,
\q1 because they will just continue doing their own foolish things,
\q1 and they will not pay any attention to you
\q2 \add when you cry out for help\add*."

\v 15 /q1 They will disappoint you with whom you have done business with since your childhood:  
         /q2 theywander their separate ways, leaving  no one  to save you.
