\v 3 My defense to them that examine me is this,
\v 4 have we no right to eat and to drink?
\v 5 Have we no right to take with us a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?
\v 6 Or is it only Barnabas and I that are denied the right to not work?
