\c 24
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 The earth is Jehovahâ€™s, and the fulness thereof;
\q The world, and they that dwell therein.
\q
\v 2 For he has founded it upon the seas,
\q And established it upon the floods.
\q
\v 3 Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah?
\q And who shall stand in his holy place?
\q
\v 4 He that has clean hands, and a pure heart;
\q Who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood,
\q And has not sworn deceitfully.
\q
\v 5 He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah,
\q And righteousness from the God of his salvation.
\q
\v 6 This is the generation of them that seek after him,
\q That seek your face, even Jacob. \qs [Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 7 Lift up your heads, O you gates;
\q And be you lifted up, you everlasting doors:
\q And the King of glory will come in.
\q
\v 8 Who is the King of glory?
\q Jehovah strong and mighty,
\q Jehovah mighty in battle.
\q
\v 9 Lift up your heads, O you gates;
\q Yea, lift them up, you everlasting doors:
\q And the King of glory will come in.
\q
\v 10 Who is this King of glory?
\q Jehovah of hosts,
\q He is the King of glory. \qs [Selah\qs*
