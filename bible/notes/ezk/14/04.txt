\v 4 Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that takes
his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I Jehovah
will answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols;
\v 5 that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
