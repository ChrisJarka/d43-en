\v 27 But God, will you really live on the earth among people? There is not enough space in heaven for you to have enough space to live there. So this temple that I have commanded my workers to build is certainly too small for you to live in.
\v 28 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to me while I am praying to you this day.

\v 27 But will God actually live on the earth? Look, the entire universe and heaven itself cannot contain you—how much less can this temple that I have built!
\v 28 Yet please respect this prayer of your servant and his request, Yahweh my God; listen to the cry and prayer that your servant prays before you today.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But will God actually live on the earth?** - Solomon asks a question to show that he understands that God does not live on the earth. He speaks of God as if he were speaking of someone else. 1) He may do this to show that he respects God. AT: "But I know that you do not actually live on earth!" 2) Or he is asking a general question. AT: "But it surely cannot be that God will actually live on the earth!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Look** - "What I am about to say is important" or "The truth is that"
  * **you—how much less can this temple that I have built** - "you, so this temple that I have built certainly cannot"
  * **this prayer of your servant and his request** - The words "prayer" and "request" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that he is sincere as he makes his request. Solomon speaks of himself as if he were another person to show that he respects Yahweh. AT: "me, your servant, as I make this request" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]]) 
  * **the cry and prayer that your servant prays** - The words "cry" and "prayer" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that he is sincere as he asks Yahweh to help him. Solomon speaks of himself as if he were another person to show that he respects Yahweh. AT: "me, your servant, as I call for you to help me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
