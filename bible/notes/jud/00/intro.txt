=== What is the Book of Jude about? ===

His purpose in writing the letter to all Christians is to warn them against being led astray by false teachers (Jude 4).  He references Old Testament events and accounts to give strength to his arguments.  This letter shares many ideas with 2 Peter including the warning against false teachers (Jude 4, 2 Peter 2:1) as well as references to angels and Sodom and Gomorrah.

=== Who wrote the Book of Jude? ===

The letter called Jude is named after its author.  Jude identifies himself as the brother of James, Jesus' brother.  So he is also believed to be one of Jesus' brothers (1).  We do not know if this letter was intended for a specific church and due to the references to the Old Testament, Jude's original readers were likely made up of Jews.  However, he addresses his letter to "all who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ" (1).  The letter was likely written around 60 after the birth of Christ.
