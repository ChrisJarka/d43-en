In some parts of the Bible, the words "men," "brothers" and "sons" refer specifically to men. In other parts of the Bible, those words include both men and women. When the writer meant both men and women, translators need to translate it in a way that does not limit the meaning to men.

==== Description ====

In some languages a word that normally refers to men can be used to refer to both men and women. For example, the Bible sometimes says 'brothers' when it refers to both brothers and sisters. 

Also in some languages, the masculine pronouns "he" and "him" can be used for any person if it is not import whether the person is a man or women. In the example below, the pronoun "he" but it is not limited to males.

>A wise child makes __his__ father rejoice \\ 
>but a foolish child brings grief to __his__ mother. (Proverbs 10:1 ULB)

In some parts of the Bible, the words "men," "brothers" and "sons" refer specifically to men. In other parts of the Bible, those words include both men and women. When the writer meant both men and women, translators need to translate it in a way that does not limit the meaning to men.



Also in some languages "he" can be used for any person if the gender of the person is not important,  but in other languages, "he" could only refer to a male. 
  *A wise child makes __his__ father rejoice, but a foolish child brings grief to __his__ mother. (Proverbs 10:1 ULB)
In some languages, if the pronoun "he" is used, people would think that this only refers to males. 

=== Reason this is a translation issue ===

  * In some cultures words like "man," "brother," and "son" can only be used to refer to men. If those words are used, people will think that what is being said does not apply to women.
  * In some cultures, the masculine pronouns "he" and "him" can only refer to males. If only masculine pronouns are used, people will think that what is said does not apply to women.

=== Translation Principles === 

When a statement applies to both men and women, translate it in such a way that people will be able to understand that.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

> __The wise man__ dies just like the fool dies. (Ecclesiastes 2:16 ULB)
This verse does not contrast men and women. What it says is true of both. In some languages, if the word "man" is used, people would think that this is only true about men, and not about women too.  

>He said to them all, "If anyone wants to come after me, __he__ must deny __himself__, take up __his__ cross daily, and follow me. Whoever would try to save __his__ life will lose it, but whoever loses __his__ life for my sake, __he__ will save it. What does it benefit a __man__, if __he__ gains the whole world, but loses or forfeits __his__ own self? (Matthew 16:24-26 ULB)

Jesus was not talking about only men. He wanted men and women to follow him.
===== Translation Strategies =====
If people would understand that in certain sentences, the nouns "man" and "brother" and the pronouns "he" and "him" can include females, then consider using them. Otherwise, here are some ways for dealing with those words when they include females. 

  - Use nouns that can be used for both men and women.
  - Use pronouns that can be used for both men and women.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. Use nouns that can be used for both men and women.
  * **__The wise man__ dies just like the fool dies.** (Ecclesiastes 2:16 ULB)
    * "The wise person dies just like the fool dies." 
    * "Wise people die just like fools die."

2. Use pronouns that can be used for both men and women.
  * **He said to them all, "If anyone wants to come after me, __he__ must deny __himself__, take up __his__ cross daily, and follow me. Whoever would try to save __his__ life will lose it, but whoever loses __his__ life for my sake, __he__ will save it. What does it benefit a __man__, if __he__ gains the whole world, but loses or forfeits __his__ own self?"** (Matthew 16:24-26 ULB) - English speakers can change the singular pronouns "he," "himself" and his" to plural pronouns "they,"'themselves" and "their" in order to show that it applies to all people, not just men.
    * He said to them all, "People who want to come after me must deny __themselves__, take up __their__ cross daily, and follow me. People who try to save __their__ life will lose it, but __those__ who lose __their__ life for my sake will save it. What does it benefit __people__, if __they__ gain the whole world, but lose or forfeit __their__ own self?"
