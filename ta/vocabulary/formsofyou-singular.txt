The word ‘singular’ means ‘one of’ or ‘single’. The word ‘dual’ means ‘two’. The word ‘plural’ means ‘many of’ or ‘multiple’.

**Languages Differ on the Use of the Forms of You**

Some languages, like English, have only one word for ‘you’ regardless of how many people are being spoken to. English speakers can refer to one person as ‘you’ or to many people as ‘you’. Often the context will make it clear as to whether the word ‘you’ refers to one person or more than one.  Looking at the other pronouns in the sentence will help you distinguish the audience.

Some languages have more than one word for ‘you’ depending on how many people are being spoken to. If they are speaking to one person, they use the ‘singular’ form of ‘you’. If they are speaking to more than one person, they use the ‘plural’ form of ‘you.’

Some languages have a ‘dual’ form for speaking to two people and some have other forms for speaking to three or four people.

  * Note that for many languages, the decision about what form of the pronoun to use will also affect the form of the verb associated with it, even in cases where the word “you” is not expressed (for example when a command is given).

The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. These languages both have a singular form of you and a plural form of you. When reading the Bible in a language that does not have distinct singular and plural forms of ‘you’, the context will often make it clear whether the word “you” is intended to refer to one person, to two people, or to more than two people.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Here are some examples of ‘you’ in the **Singular**  form from the Bible. When these verses were first written in the Greek language, the singular form of ‘you’ was used because it was only referring to one person.

  * Luke 18:21, 22 //He said, “I have observed all these things from my youth up.” When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”//

Note that even though English does not have singular and plural forms of ‘you’, the context indicates that this word ‘you’ here only refers to one person. The man had just told Jesus “I have observed these things” and Jesus responded with “you”, referring only to that one man.

  * Acts 12:8 //Then the angel said to him, “Put on your clothes and sandals.” And Peter did so. “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me,” the angel told him.//

The context makes it clear that the angel is addressing one person, so the singular form of “you” would be used here in languages that make that distinction. The verbs “put on“ and “wrap,” would also need the singular form of ‘you’.
