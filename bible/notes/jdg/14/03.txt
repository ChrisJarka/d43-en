\v 3 Then his father and his mother said to him, “Is there not at all a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all our people, so that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?”  Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for
she pleases me well.”
\v 4 But his father and his mother did not know that this matter came from Yahweh, for he was seeking an occasion to fight against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.
