===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **man** - The word "man" refers to a person in general, not just an adult male.
    * **unclean** - Another possible translation could be "dirty." This refers to a ceremonial uncleanness rather than a state of muddiness.
    * **cried out with a loud voice**  - That is, "he shouted with a big sound." In colloquial English we might say, "he shouted at the top of his lungs."
    * **to destroy** - That is, "to immediately destroy completely" so that no repair is possible. The demons knew Jesus could send them into the lake of fire in an instant.
    * **know** - For languages with separate words for "to know," other possible words include "see," "understand," "perceive" or "know by intuition."
