======  Matthew 23 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Hypocrisy ==
This is to say one thing and then doing the opposite. The hypocrisy of the Pharisees is a major teaching in this chapter.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
There are many metaphors in this chapter to describe the actions of the Pharisees. Most of these metaphors explain that, while the Pharisees appear to be [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteous]] to other people, they are not. Their hearts are very [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sinful]].

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Name calling ==
In most cultures, it is wrong to "call someone a bad name" or to insult them. Many of the words in this chapter directed at the Pharisees can be taken as insults. They are called "hypocrites," "blind guides," "fools," and "serpents." They are used here to describe and condemn their behavior. It would not be wrong for Jesus to speak in this way.

== Paradox ==

This is a statement that  seems absurd or appears to contradict itself. For example, "he who is greatest among you will be your servant" ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:23:11|23:11-12]])
