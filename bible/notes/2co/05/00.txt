====== 2 Corinthians 05 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== New bodies in heaven ==
Paul knows, when he dies, he will receive a much better body. Because of this, he is not afraid of being killed for preaching the [[:en:obe:kt:goodnews|Good News]]. So he tells others that they too can be [[:en:obe:kt:reconcile|reconciled]] to God. Christ will take away their [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] and give them his [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]]. 

== New creation ==

The new creation and the old is probably a reference to Paul's illustrations of the old and new self. These concepts are also equivalent to the old and new man. The term “old” probably not a reference to the sinful nature that a person is born with, but is a reference to the old way of living or the Christian's former bondage to sin. The “new creation” is the new nature or new life that is given to a person after they come to [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]] in Christ.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Home ==
The Christian's home is no longer in the world. A Christian's home is in [[:en:obe:kt:heaven|heaven]]. This is a common [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]] used in Scripture. The use of this imagery in this chapter emphasizes the temporariness of the Christian's circumstances. It gives [[:en:obe:kt:hope|hope]] to those who are suffering.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "The message of reconciliation" ==
This is a reference to the gospel. It is a call for those who are hostile to God, to [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repent]] and be [[:en:obe:kt:reconcile|reconciled]] to him.
