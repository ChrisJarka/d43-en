\v 15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then
said I in my heart, that this also is vanity.
\v 16 For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have
been long forgotten. And how does the wise man die even as the fool!
