===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **synagogue of the Freedmen**: Probably ex-slaves.
This can be understood various ways: This may have been one synagogue with people from all four of these places. Or it may have been two synagogues: one composed of Cyrenians and Alexandrians (cities from north Africa), and a second synagogue composed of people from the Roman provinces of Cilicia and Asia, north of the Mediterranean Sea. Or it may have been one synagogue composed of Cyrenians and Alexandrians, with other people from Cilicia and Asia simply joining in the debate. It could even have been five synagogues, or some other combination.
