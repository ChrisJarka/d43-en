<usfm>
\v 14 Now listen to me! It is time for me to come to you for a third \add visit. When I come\add*, I \add still\add* will not insist that you \add pay me for my work\add*, because I do not want \add any of\add* your \add money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*! What I want is for you \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to love and appreciate me\add*. It is not \add normally the duty of\add* children to save \add money to provide for the needs of\add* their parents. Instead, it \add is the duty of\add* parents to \add provide\add* for their children \f + \ft metaphor \f*. In the same way, \add it is not your duty to provide for me. Instead, it is my duty to provide spiritual help for you because you are my spiritual children\add*.
\v 15 So, on my part, \add as a good parent would do\add*, I will be very happy to use everything that I have, and do everything that I possibly can, \add in order to help you\add*. And because I love you very much, I will be very disappointed if \add you\add* do not love me a little bit, too.\f + \ft Or: will \add you\add* not love me a little bit, too? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 14 Look at this! I am now ready to visit you for a third time, and on this trip, as on all the others, I will not make you give me any money. I do not want anything you have. What I want is you! You know the principle that we all follow in our families: the children should not pay the expenses of their parents, but the parents save up to pay the expenses of the children. This is what I am doing for you. I am the parent, and you are the children. I am paying to help you.
\v 15  I am glad to spend money on you, and to have my life emptied out for you. I want to love you more and more, but does this mean that you love me less and less?

\v 14 See! I am ready to come to you a third time, and I will not be a burden, for I do not want what is yoursâ€”I want you. For children should not save up for the parents, but the parents should save up for the children.
\v 15 I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?
