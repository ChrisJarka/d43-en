====== Jeremiah 19:4-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 \add That will happen\add* because you Israelite people have stopped worshiping me, and have caused this place to be a place where \add you worship\add* foreign gods. You burn sacrifices to gods that neither you nor your ancestors nor even the kings of Judah ever heard about. And you have filled this place with the blood of innocent people \add whom you have killed\add*.
\v 5 You have built shrines to honor your god Baal, and at those shrines you have \add killed\add* your own children and offered them to be sacrifices to Baal. I never commanded you to do that, I never spoke about doing that, I never even thought about anyone doing that.
\v 6 So, beware, because I, Yahweh, say that there will be a time when this garbage dump will no longer be called Topheth or Hinnom Valley; it will be called Slaughter Valley.

\v 4 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it to other gods, that they
knew not, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
\v 5 and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal; which I commanded
not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:
\v 6 therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the
son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter.
