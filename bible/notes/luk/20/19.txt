\v 19 And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they understood that he spoke this parable against them.
\v 20 And they watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might find fault with his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.
