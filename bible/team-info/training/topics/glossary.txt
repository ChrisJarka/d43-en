=== Terms ===

**Door43**  - This is the name of the online site where we are developing our translation resources. The name refers to Colossians 4:3 "//And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message//."

**dynamic translation** - This contrasts with a "literal" translation. A "dynamic" translation favors readability over adherence to the form of the original language. Dynamic translations should still be accurate, but more freely adjust sentence order and length, and also more willing replace difficult words and phrases with more easily-understood equivalents.

**Etherpad** - This is an online editor outside of Door43 where the text team is editing the ULB and UDB versions.

**gateway language** - Also called "trade" languages. These languages are major languages that are widely-spoken by people of many different people groups or sub-languages. They can serve as "intermediate" languages in which we can provide translation resources to speakers of smaller languages.

**importantWords** - This is the official repository for the "Important Terms" content. It is divided into two sectionsâ€“ Key Terms, and Other terms. "Key terms" have greater theological significance and tend to be more abstract than the "Other terms" and therefore include more guidance about how to translate them accurately.

**literal translation** - This contrasts with a "dynamic" translation. A "literal" translation tries to remain as close as possible to the form and grammar of the original language. A literal translation should still be readable, but avoids using equivalents when possible.

**namespace** - This is the term used, instead of folders, for the organization of the Door43 pages. For example the Door43 page with the URL of [[https://door43.org/en/obs|https://door43.org/en/obs]] is the namespace of //obs //  in the namespace of //en//.

**Quick Reference** - The Quick Reference Guide is short explanations and examples of the format for translation notes.

**translationAcademy** - This is the name of the area that the pages and modules will be developed for training the national translators.

**translationDatabase** - translationDatabase is an unfoldingWord project [[http://td.unfoldingword.org/]] that lists all languages by language name, region or country.

**translationQuestions** - Translators should use the translationQuestions during the level checking process to check that the translation is accurate, natural and clear. The translation can be approved for level 2 when the questions have been answered correctly. 

**translationStudio** - This is the app that will enable people to translate the Bible on a phone or tablet.

**unfoldingWord** - This is the name of the app that will display all of the Bible translations that are completed in TranslationStudio.
