\v 15 Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name.
\v 16 But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
\v 17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit to them: for they watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this were unprofitable for you.
