\v 17 On the first day of the week-long Festival of Bread with no Yeast, the disciples went to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the meal for the Passover celebration so that we can eat it with you?"
\v 18 Jesus instructed two of the disciples about what they should do. He said to them, "Go into the city to a man with whom I have previously arranged this. Tell him this: 'The Teacher says, "The time that I told you about is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover meal with my disciples at your house, and I have sent these two to prepare the meal."'"
\v 19 So the two disciples did as Jesus told them. They went and prepared the Passover meal in that man's house.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Unleavened Bread **- This refers to a Jewish festival that was celebrated for more than one day (see UDB).
  * **eat the Passover**  - If required for clarity, this can be expanded to "eat the Passover meal" (see UDB).
  * **He said, "Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'"**  - This is a complex set of direct quotations where Jesus is saying to his disciples to tell a certain man what he ("The Teacher") says to tell that man. Depending on how the receptor language handles direct and indirect discourse, all or part of this may need to be expressed indirectly. One example would be as follows: "He told his disciples to go into the city to a certain man and say to him that the Teacher says: 'My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.' "
  * **My time**  - This has the meaning of "The time God has set for me" or "My appointed time" or "The time that I told you about" (UDB).
  * **is at hand **- This is an idiom that can mean either "is near" (UDB) or "has come." (See: Idiom)
  * **keep the Passover**  - "keep the Passover meal" or "celebrate the Passover meal" (UDB)
