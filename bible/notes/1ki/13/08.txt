\v 8 And the man of God said to the king, If you will give me half your house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat
bread nor drink water in this place;
\v 9 for so was it charged me by the word of Jehovah, saying, You shall eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the
way that you camest.
\v 10 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.
