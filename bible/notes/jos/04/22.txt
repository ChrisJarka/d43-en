\v 22 Tell your children, 'This is where Israel crossed over the Jordan on dry ground.'
\v 23 Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you had crossed over, just as Yahweh your God did to the Sea of Reeds, which he dried up for us until we passed over,  24 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of Yahweh is mighty, and that you may honor Yahweh your God forever."
