===== Translation Notes: =====

The arrival of Jesus' mother and brothers becomes an opportunity for him to describe his spiritual family.

  * **him who told** - "the person who had told Jesus his mother and brothers were waiting to see him"
  * **Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?** - AT: "I will tell you who is really my mother and brothers." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **whoever** - "anyone"
  * **the will of my Father...is my brother...sister, and mother.** - God the Father and Son and Spirit are the infinitely close, loving God. When we trust our lives to Jesus Christ and his forgiveness, we are accepted into God's own family and loved by the persons of God, forever. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
