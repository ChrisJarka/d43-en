\v 8 So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together
to Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper
of the women.
\v 9 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with
her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king’s house: and he removed her and her maidens
to the best place of the house of the women.
