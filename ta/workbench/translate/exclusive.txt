Examples(s)

=== Reason this could be a translation issue (recommended) ===

The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. Like English, these languages do not have separate exclusive pronouns. This is not a problem for translators whose language also does not have exclusive pronouns. When a translator sees the word “we,” they can use the word for “we” in their own language. But translators whose language has separate exclusive pronouns will always have to be careful whenever they read words like “we” “us” and “ours.” in English, Hebrew, or Greek. They will always have to figure out whether they should use the pronoun that includes the person being spoken to or the pronoun that excludes the person being spoken to. 

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Forgive us our sins** (Luke 11:4) \\ 
God has no sins to forgive; so languages that have exclusive forms of “we” and “us” would use the exclusive forms in this verse.\\ 

** we have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us** (1 John 1:2) \\ 
John is telling what he and the other apostles have seen to those who have not seen Jesus. So languages that have exclusive forms of “we” and “us” would use the exclusive forms in this verse.\\
