====== John 15:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 You are already \add like\add* the branches \add that a gardener\add* trims because \add you have believed\add* the message that I have told you.
\v 4 Remain having a close relationship with me. \add If you do that\add*, I will remain having a close relationship with you. A branch \add of a vine\add* cannot bear fruit \add if it is cut off and left\add* by itself. To bear fruit, it must remain attached to the vine. Similarly, you cannot \add live the way that God wants you to\add* if you do not remain united to me \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 You are already pure because of the message I spoke to you.
\v 4 Remain in me, and I will remain in you. As the branch cannot bear any fruit on its own, neither can you, unless you stay close to me and you are dependent upon me for everything.

<usfm>
\v 3 Already you are clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
\v 4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye,
except you abide in me.
