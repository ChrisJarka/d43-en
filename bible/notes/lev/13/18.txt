\v 18 When the body has a boil on  the skin and it has healed,
\v 19 and in the place where the boil was there is white swelling or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it must be shown to the priest. 
\v 20 The priest will examine it to see if it appears deeper under the skin, and if the hair there has turned white, then the priest must pronounce him unclean. It is an infectious disease, perhaps leprosy, if it has broken out where the boil was.
