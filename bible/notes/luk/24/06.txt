===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (The angels continue talking to the women.)
  * **remember how**  - "remember what"
  * **he spoke to you** - Jesus had said this at least a week earlier. 
  * **to you** The word "you" is plural. It refers to the women and the other disciples. (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:formsofyou]]) 
  * **that the Son of Man** - This is the beginning of an indirect quote. It can also be translated with a direct quote as in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:quotation]])
  * **the Son of Man must be**  - "it was necessary for the Son of Man to be." This is something that would certainly happen because God had already decided that it would.
  * **delivered up into the hands of**  - "handed over to" or "given over to." It can also be translated with an active verb: "They will have to handâ€¦over" (UDB). (See:[[en:ta:vocabulary:active]])
