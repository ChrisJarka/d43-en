===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 1 Think about how much our Father loves us! He allows us to say that we are his children! And this is indeed true! But people who are unbelievers have not understood who God is. So they do not understand who we are, that we are God's children. \v 2 Dear friends, even though at present we are God's children, he has not yet shown us what we will be like in the future. However, we know that when Christ comes back again, we will become like him, because we will see him face to face. \v 3 So all those who confidently expect to see Christ as he actually is must keep themselves in every way from sinning, just like Christ, who never sins in any way. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \c 3 \p \v 1 See what kind of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God, and this is what we are! For this reason, the world does not know us, because it did not know him. \v 2 Beloved, now are we children of God, and it has not yet been revealed what we will be. We know that when Christ appears, we will be like him, for we will see him just as he is. \v 3 And every one that has this hope set on him purifies himself, just as he is pure. </usfm>
