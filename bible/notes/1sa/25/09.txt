\v 9 And when David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
\v 10 And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants
now-a-days that break away every man from his master.
\v 11 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men of whom I
know not whence they are?
