===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He built up siege works against me** - Siege works are ramps that an army builds around a city to enable them to climb over the city walls and invade the city. 
  * **He built up siege works against me** - Possible meanings are 1) the author speaks of God causing bad things to happen to him as if he were a city and God was an enemy that built up siege works against him. AT: "God attacked me like an enemy army that sets up siege works around a city" or 2) the author speaks of God causing the enemy army to attack Jerusalem as if God were the enemy. AT: "God caused the enemy army to build up siege works against me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **surrounded me with bitterness and hardship** - This represents God causing him to experience much bitterness and hardship. AT: "caused me to experience much bitterness and hardship" or "caused me to suffer and have many problems" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **bitterness** - Here "bitterness" represents suffering. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He made me live in dark places, like those who died long ago** - Here "dark places" is a metaphor for suffering. The author compares the intensity of his suffering to the intensity of the darkness that those who died long ago experience. AT: "The suffering that he causes me is intense like the darkness of the grave" or "He makes me suffer terribly, as if I were in the darkness of those who died long ago" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **He built a wall around me and I cannot escape. He made my chains heavy** - This represents the continuing suffering. Like a person who cannot escape from prison, the author cannot make his suffering stop. AT: "My suffering continues. It is as though he has built a wall around me and put heavy chains on me, and I cannot escape" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he shut out my prayer** - The author speaks about God refusing to listen to his prayers as though God was shutting his ears so that the author's prayers could not go into them. AT: "he refuses to hear my prayer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
