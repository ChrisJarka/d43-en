\v 9 So it will be that every living soul that swarms in every place where rivers go will live, and there will be a great multitude of fish since these waters are coming here, and they will be healed and everything will live wherever the river goes.
\v 10 Then it will be the fishermen of En-Gedi will stand by it and there will be a place to dry out the fishing nets by En-Eglaim. Their fish will be after their own kind like the fish of the great sea in a great abundance.
