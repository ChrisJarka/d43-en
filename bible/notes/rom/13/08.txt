\v 8 Owe no one anything, unless to love one another. For he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the Law.
\v 9 For it is this, "You shall not commit adultery. You shall not kill. You shall not steal. You shall not covet." If there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, that is, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
\v 10 Love does not harm his neighbor. Love therefore is the fulfilment of the Law.
