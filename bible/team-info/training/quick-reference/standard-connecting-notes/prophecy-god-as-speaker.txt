====== Prophecy: Identifying God as the Speaker ======

===== Description =====

In prophetic material there are often several layers of embedded quotes. For example Isaiah 7:1-2 says: \\ 
  * The word of Yahweh came to me and said, "You, Son of man--thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel: 'An end! An end has come to the four borders of the land!

The following chunk starts with: \\ 
  * Now the end is upon you, for I am sending out my wrath on you,

Instead of writing notes saying who the words "I" and "you" refer to, we can write a connecting note like the following: "These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel." It's true that Yahweh was speaking to Ezekiel, but in his message he was addressing the people of Israel.

When writing the notes, replace "[the audience]" with the identity of the intended audience, such as "the people of Israel" or "the people of Babylon." \\


===== Standard Notes =====

These are Yahweh's words to [his audience].
