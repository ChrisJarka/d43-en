======  Matthew 18 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Church Discipline ==

This chapter has a concentrated teaching on the subject of church discipline. When two people get into a disagreement, there is a "biblical" way to resolve this conflict and bring honor to God. Also, when a person is living in a [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sinful]] way, the church a responsibility to call them to [[en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]].

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Little Child ==

This is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]] used this chapter. It is intended to compare the simple, child-like faith of those who believe in Jesus with those who reject Jesus because they are too "grown up" to not need him.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Conditionals ==
There are several conditional statements in this chapter (verses 15-17). These sentences take a statement and add a condition to it. They are typically formed with the words "if" and "then." For example: "if it rains, then we will not have school" means that that there will be no school if it rains but there will be school if it rains. It is also possible to introduce conditional statements with an implicit "when." For example, "if it rains, we will not have school." Matthew omits the word "when" in his conditionals in chapter 18.
