====== Hebrews 04:1-2 ======

<usfm>
\v 1 \add The Israelites did not enter the place where they would rest\add*. But \add God\add* has still promised us that we can enter the place of resting \add in heaven eternally\add*. So we must beware \add of the possibility\add* that \add God\add* may consider that some of you have failed to enter the \add place of\add* resting \add eternally as the Israelites did not enter the place where they would rest\add*.
\v 2 We have heard the message\add about Christ\add*, just like \add the Israelites\add* heard \add what God promised\add*. But \add just like\add* the message did not benefit \add most of\add* those who heard it because they did not believe it as \add Joshua and Caleb did, it\add* will not\add benefit us eternally if we do not keep believing it\add*.

\v 1 God has promised that we would rest, but we must be careful, because we can miss God's place of rest.
\v 2 We have heard the good news about how Jesus gives us God's rest, just as the Israelites heard God promise that they would rest in Canaan. But just as that message did not help many Israelites because they did not trust God as Joshua and Caleb did, the good news about Christ will not help us if we do not trust God.

\p
\v 1 Therefore, let us be very careful so that none of you might seem to have failed to reach the promise left behind for you to enter God's rest.
\v 2 For we were told the good news just as they were. But that message did not benefit those who did not join in faith with those who obeyed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Chapter 4 continues the warning to believers starting in chapter [[:en:bible:notes:heb:03:07|3:7]]. God, through the writer, gives believers a rest of which God's rest in the creation of the world is a picture.

  * **Therefore** - because God will certainly punish those who do not obey ([[:en:bible:notes:heb:03:16|3:19]])
  * **none of you might seem to have failed to reach the promise left behind to enter God's rest** - This double negative means that the author hopes that they will enter into God's rest. AT: "God will say of all of you that you may rest where he is." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the promise left behind** - the promise that God gave
  * **we must be** - This includes the writer and the readers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **to us** - to the writer and the readers
  * **those who did not join in faith with those who obeyed** - The author is talking about two groups of people, those who received God's covenant with faith, and those who heard it but did not believe.
