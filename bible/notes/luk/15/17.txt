\v 18 So I will leave here and go back to my father. I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God \f + \ft metonymy, euphemism \f* and against you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add*.

\v 17 Finally he began to think clearly about how foolish he had been and he said to himself: 'All of my father's hired servants have more than enough food to eat but here I am dying because I do not have anything to eat!
\v 18 So I will leave here and go back to my father. I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God and against you.
\v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; please just employ me to work for you as one of your hired servants."'

\v 17 But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough food, and I am here, dying from hunger!
\v 18 I will leave here and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.
\v 19 I am no more worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired servants."'
