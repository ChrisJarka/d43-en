\v 12 I am writing this to you whom I love as though you were my own children. God has forgiven your sins because of what Christ has done for you.
\v 13 I am writing to you believers who are older than the others. You have know Christ, who has always lived. I am also writing to you young men; you have defeated Satan, the evil one. And I am writing to you little children, because you know God the Father.
\v 14 I will say it again: I am writing this to you older men because you have come to know Christ, the one who has always existed. And I am writing to you young men, because you are strong and you continue to obey what God commands, and because you have defeated Satan, the evil one.
