\p
\v 15 Then Amnon hated Tamar with extreme hatred. He hated her with a greater hate than the lust with which he "loved" her.. Amnon said to her, "Get up and get out."
\v 16 But conversely she responded to him, "No! Because this great evil of making me leave is worse than raping me!" But Amnon would not listen to her.
\v 17 Then he called his personal servant and said, "Take this woman away from me, and bolt the door after
her."
