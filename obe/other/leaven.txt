====== leaven, yeast ======

===== Definition: =====

Leaven is a substance that makes bread dough rise. It is sometimes called leavening.

  * The leaven used in the Bible was yeast, which fills the bread dough with gas bubbles, making the dough rise, or expand before baking it
  * Yeast is kneaded into the dough until it has been spread throughout the entire lump of dough.
  * Leaven, or yeast, is used metaphorically in the Bible as a picture of how sin spreads through a person's life or how sin can influence other people.
  * When the Israelites escaped from Egypt, they didn't have time to wait for bread dough to rise so they made bread without leaven to take with them on their journey. As a reminder of this, every year the Jewish people celebrate Passover by only eating bread that is made without leaven.
  * This could be translated as "yeast" or "substance that causes expanding."
