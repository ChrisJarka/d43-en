\v 13 Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath; and there shall be an
overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.

mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, and you
shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
