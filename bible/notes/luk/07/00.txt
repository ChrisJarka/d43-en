=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Centurion ==
This situation would have been very unusual in ancient Israel. It would not have been common for a Roman soldier to go to an Israelite for anything. They would have been insignificant to the Romans and they would not have sought healing from a Jew. It would also have been unusual for a wealthy man to be so concerned for his slave. It is a great display of faith.
