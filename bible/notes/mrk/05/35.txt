===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the teacher any more?- **  Because Jarius' daughter already died his servants did not believe that Jesus would be able to do anything to heal her.  The thought that Jesus could or would raise her from the dead did not occur to them.
