===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **Where are you?**  - This can also be translated as "Why are you trying to hide from me?" (UDB). God knew where the man was. When the man answered, he did not say where he was but why he was hiding. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|]])
  * **you**  - God was speaking to the man. Languages that have a singular form of 'you' would use that one. (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:formsofyou|Forms of 'You']])
  * **I heard you**  - This could be translated "I heard your sound." "I heard your voice"
  * **not to eat from**  - This could be translated "not to eat from it."
  * **"How did you find out â€¦" (UDB) - **  First question from God**: Where**  are you? Second question,** Who **  told you?
  * **bold words**  - explanation
