<usfm>
\v 1 Soon after Jehoiakim became the king of Judah, Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 2 "This is what I, Yahweh, am telling you: Stand in the courtyard \add in front\add* of my temple, and speak to all the people from the various towns in Judah who come there to worship me. Tell them everything that I tell you; do not omit anything.
\v 3 If you do tell them everything, perhaps they will pay attention, and each one of them will turn away from his evil behavior. Then I will change my mind, and not bring on them the disaster that I was planning to bring on them because of the evil things that they have done.

\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came from Yahweh and said,
\v 2 â€œThus says Yahweh: Stand in the court of the house of Yahweh and declare concerning all the cities of Judah who come to worship at the house of Yahweh all the words that I commanded 
you to declare to them. Do not limit the word!
\v 3 It may be they will hear and each man may turn from his wicked way so I may relent concerning the calamity that I am planning to do to them because of the wickedness of their practices.
