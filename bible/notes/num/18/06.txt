===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I myself have chosen the descendants of Levi from the other Israelites in order that they may be your special helpers. They are like a gift that I have given you to work at the Sacred Tent.
\v 7 But it is you and your sons, who are the priests, who must perform all the rituals concerning the altar and with what happens inside the Very Holy Place. I am giving to you this work of serving as priests. So anyone else who tries to do that work must be executed."

\v 6 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given to Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting.
\v 7 And you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and you shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.
