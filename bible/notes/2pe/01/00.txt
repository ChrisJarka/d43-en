== Knowing God ==
Christian spiritual growth is often described as knowing God more or knowing God better. This is because a growing Christian understands the things of God better as they grow.

== Forgetting what God has done ==
Peter believes  Christian who are not leading [[:en:obe:kt:godly|godly]] lives have forgotten the cost of their salvation. He reasons that if the remembered their former life and what Jesus has done, they would be sufficiently motivated to live godly lives.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Divine revelation ==
Peter describes Christianity as a religions that has been revealed and prove by God and it is implied that it is therefore not a creation of man, like so all other religions (except Judaism). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
