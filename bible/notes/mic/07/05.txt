\v 5 Trust you not in a neighbor; put you not confidence in a friend; keep the doors of your mouth from her that lies in your
bosom.
\v 6 For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law; a manâ€™s enemies are the men of his own house.
