===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Yahweh, what is man that you take notice of him or the son of man that you think about him?** - Both of these phrases mean the same thing. The writer uses a question to emphasize his surprise that God pays attention to humans since they are not very important. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **like a breath...like a passing shadow** - The writer compares humans to these thing to emphasize how quick their lives are. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
