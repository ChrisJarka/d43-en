===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of Romans ===

  - Paul begins his letter normally by introducing himself and saying who he was writing to (1:115)

=== What is Romans about? ===

The occasion for this letter was that Paul was preparing to leave Corinth so he could take a gift of money back to Jerusalem, to help the church in Jerusalem that was suffering. After going back to Jerusalem, Paul planned to travel to Rome to encourage the church there, and soon after that, he hoped to travel on to Spain to start new churches there.  Paul writes this letter to prepare for this journey to Rome.  He stated his purpose was to "bring about the obedience of faith" (16:26).
 
Most scholars would agree that Romans is the most profound and theologically rich letter in the New Testament. More has been written about the book of Romans than any other book of the Bible.
 
In Romans, Paul describes Jesus Christ with these titles and descriptions: Jesus Christ (1:1), The Seed of David (1:3), The Son of God (1:4), The Lord Jesus Christ (1:7), Christ Jesus (3:24), Propitiation (3:25), Jesus (3:26), Jesus our Lord (4:24), Lord of Hosts  (9:29), A Stumbling Stone and Rock of Offence (9:33), The End of the Law (10:4), The Deliverer (11:26), Lord of the Dead and the Living (14:9),and the Root of Jesse  (15:12).
 
Here is a list of some important theological terms:  Righteousness (1:17), Sin (3:20), Justification (5:1), Grace (1:7), Reconciliation (5:7), Gospel (1:16), Salvation (1:16), Propitiation (3:23-25), Imputation (4:6-8), Sanctification (6:1-13), Preservation (8:35-39), Supplication (8:26, 27), Transformation (12:1, 2) and Glorification (8:16-23).
 
=== Who wrote the Book of Romans? ===

The book of Romans was written around AD 57, during the Third Missionary Journey of Paul (Acts 18:22-21:17). Paul of Tarsus was the author. He wrote to the Roman Christians while he was staying in Corinth.
 
Paul had been known as "Saul" when he was a Pharisee and a persecutor of the church before his conversion to faith in Christ. He had been a scholar in the Jewish law. But he became a Christian and an apostle of Jesus Christ. See the account of his conversion to Christ in Acts 9:1-22.
