**What is Ruth about?**\\

The book of Ruth is a biography of the principle character, Ruth, the daughter-in-law of Naomi. One of the purposes of the book is to show Ruth’s connection to King David. It also shows the blessings that came when God’s people faithfully followed the covenant, blessings that God often brought through the ordinary events of life. The story of Ruth has many lessons about faith, fidelity, self-sacrifice, and integrity.  

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
While these titles often describe the author or audience of the biblical book, “Ruth” is a reference to the book's main character. Many title choose to summarize the contents of the book. Translators should use a self-explanatory title such as, "The Book about Ruther," or that they imitate the way the title appears in regional or national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]). 

**Who wrote Ruth?**\\
The author of the book of Ruth is not stated. While many suggestions have been made, it is best to see the book as anonymous.

**When did the events of Ruth occur?**\\
The story of Ruth is set during the time when there were "judges" in Israel. These were certain men and women who became leaders over Israel or parts of Israel both in time of war and in time of peace.

**What type of writing is Ruth?**\\
This book does not place great importance on its historical aspects. Instead, it is written as a short story. The translator should attempt to preserve the narrative quality of the book. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
**Why does Scripture include a book about a woman from Moab, one of Israel's enemies?**\\
In a period when Israel is continually [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful|unfaithful]] to Yahweh, he finds a woman from Moab who displays great faith in Him. Their lack of faith in Yahweh is contrasted with the faith of one their enemies. While it is an Israelite, Boaz, who redeems Ruth, the Messiah is one of Ruth's descendants who will redeem Israel.

**What are the important cultural traditions in Ruth?**\\
There was a practice called Levirate marriage. In ancient Israel, it was a custom for the closest male relative to provide for a related widow by marrying her. This was due to the fact that women did not normally inherit any land or property. If the closest relative did not want to marry the woman, another relative could.

There was a practice instituted in the Law of Moses called gleaning. The Law provided a way for the very poor to get food.

There was a practice instituted in the Law of Moses called a kinsman-redeemer. As part of the Law of Moses, it was important for a male to provide for a relative in need. This was especially true for the family of a man who died. 
 
===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**What is the concept of [[:en:obe:kt:covenantfaith|covenant faith]] or covenant loyalty?**\\
This concept play a significant role in Ruth. A very difficult concept to translate. Some english translations have created a word from two existing concepts (loving and kindness). Love, mercy, loyalty faithfulness in relationship to the covenant God made with Moses are part of the concept of covenant faith.  In Ruth, the provide a framework with which to understand the actions of Boaz, Ruth and Naomi which distinguish them from Israel as a whole.
