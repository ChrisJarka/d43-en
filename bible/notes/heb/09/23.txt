\v 23 Therefore, it was necessary that the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these animal sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves must be cleansed with much better sacrifices than these.
\v 24 For Christ did not enter into the most holy place made with hands, which is a copy of the true one, but instead  he entered heaven itself, where he now appears in the presence of God for us.
