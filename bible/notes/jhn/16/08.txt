\v 8 When he comes, he will prove that those who do not belong to God \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add are wrong about what is\add* sinful and about who is really righteous and about whom \add God will\add* judge \add and condemn for their sin\add*.
\v 9 \add He will tell people that their greatest\add* sin is that they do not believe in me.
\v 10 \add He will tell people that\add* because I am going \add back\add* to my Father, and you will no longer see me, \add you will know that I am the one who was truly\add* righteous.
\v 11 \add He will tell people that the fact\add* that \add God\add* has already determined that \add he\add* will punish \add Satan\add*, the one who rules this world, shows that \add some day God\add* will also punish \add those who do not belong to him\add*.

\v 8 When he comes, he will make it clear that those who do not belong to God are guilty of sin. He will show that they do not measure up to God's standard of righteousness and that they are sure to be punished. For what they have done God has forbidden.
\v 9 Their guilt from sin comes because they could not put their trust in me.
\v 10 Their failure to measure up to God's standard of goodness is confirmed because I am going back to my Father, and you will no longer see me.
\v 11 Their final accounting when God brings his punishment against them for their sin will surely come against them. This is shown by the certainty that even  Satan, the ruler of this world, will be punished for his war against God. His punishment is a promise to all who have been disobedient to God.

\v 8 And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
\v 9 of sin, because they believe not on me;
\v 10 of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you behold me no more;
\v 11 of judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.
