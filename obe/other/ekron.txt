====== Ekron ======

===== Facts: =====

Ekron was a major city of the Philistines, located nine miles inland from the Mediterranean Sea.

  * A temple of the false god Beelzebub was located at Ekron.
  * One time, the Philistines captured the ark of the covenant and took it to Ekron.
  * Because of this, God caused many people in the city of Ekron to become sick and die, so the Philistines sent the ark back to Israel.
