\v 15 For seventy years, which is as long as kings usually live, people will forget about Tyre. \add But then it will be rebuilt\add*. What will happen there will be like what happened to a prostitute in this song:
\q1
\v 16 You harlot, whom people had forgotten,
\q2 play your harp well,
\q1 and sing many songs,
\q2 in order that people will remember you again.

\v 15 In that day, Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, like to the days of a king.
After the end of seventy years it will be in Tyre as in the song of the prostitute.
\v 16 Take a harp, go about the city, you forgotten prostitute; play it well, sing many songs, that you
may be remembered.
