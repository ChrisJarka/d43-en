===== Translation Notes: =====
Nahum speaking about Yahweh's power

    * **Who can stand before his wrath? Who can resist the fierceness of his anger** - These phrases have the same meaning using different words.  They are questions that do not need to be answered because the answer is easy to understand.  The question is stated twice because of how easy the answer is to understand.  Alternate translation: "No one can remain strong when Yahweh acts against him in anger" (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]], [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
    * **stand before**  - This phrase uses a person having the strength to stand to refer to someone having the strength to fight against an enemy. "remain strong" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
    * **fierceness of his anger** - "intensity of his anger" or "amount of his anger"
    * **His wrath is poured out like fire and the rocks are broken apart**  - Yahweh's anger is compared to a volcano.  A volcano is made when melted rock is pushed to the surface of the earth.  The melted rock is called lava and could been seen as liquid fire pouring out of a mountain that just had its top explode.  The phrase "rocks are broken apart" refers to the exploding mountain and "poured out like fire" refers to the lava. (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
