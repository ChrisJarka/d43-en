<usfm>
\v 16 Aaron and his sons may eat the remaining part of the grain offering. But they must eat it in a holy place, in the courtyard of the Sacred Tent.
\v 17 It must not have yeast mixed with it. Like the offerings for sin and the offerings to cause people to no longer be guilty of sin, that offering is very holy.
\v 18 Any male descendants of Aaron are permitted to eat it, because it is forever their regular share of the offerings given to Yahweh and burned in the fire \add on the altar\add*. Anyone else who touches those offerings made from grain will be punished by God."

\v 16 And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
\v 17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering.
\v 18 Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as his portion for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: whoever touches them shall be holy.
