\v 13 Also, the other Jewish \add believers who were in Antioch\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* acted insincerely\f + \ft Or: in a way that they knew was not right \f* along with \add Peter\add*. The result was that they convinced even Barnabas to \add stop associating with the non-Jewish believers!\add*
\v 14 But when I realized that they were not acting according to the truth of the message about Christ, \add when\add* all \add the fellow believers there\add* were present, I told Peter \add the following\add*: "Although you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are a Jew, \add you often conduct yourself\add* like non-Jews \add do by disregarding Jewish laws about food. When you are among non-Jews\add*, you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* do not customarily conduct yourself at all like Jews \add do\add*. So, now it is wrong that you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are causing non-Jews \add to think that they must obey all\add* the Jewish rituals and customs!\f + \ft Or: why are you\add ( singular )\add* causing non-Jews \add to think that they must obey all\add* the Jewish rituals and customs? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

\v 13 Also, the other Jewish believers who were in Antioch acted insincerely along with Peter. The result was that they convinced even Barnabas to stop associating with the non-Jewish believers!
\v 14 But when I realized that they were not acting according to the truth of the message about Christ, when all the fellow believers there were present, I told Peter the following: "Although you are a Jew, you often conduct yourself like non-Jews do by  disregarding Jewish laws about food. When you are among non-Jews, you do not customarily conduct yourself at all like Jews do. So, now it is wrong that you are causing non-Jews to think that they must obey all the Jewish rituals and customs!"

\v 13 Also the rest of the Jews joined in this hypocrisy with him so that even Barnabas participated in their hypocrisy.
\v 14 But, when I saw that they did not follow the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of all of them, "You are Jewiish  but living like a Gentile, not a Jew (when you ate with the Gentiles). Why are you now influencing the Gentiles to live like Jews?" (by segregating themselves)
