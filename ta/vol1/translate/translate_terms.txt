**Source Text**- the text //from// which the translation is being made

**Target Language** - the language //into// which a translation is being made.

**Target Text**- the text being made by the translator.

**Original Language** - the language in which a Bible text was initially written. The Original Language of the New Testament is Greek. The Original Language of most of the Old Testament is Hebrew. However, the Original Language of some parts of Daniel and Ezra is Aramaic. The Original Language is always the most accurate language from which to translate a passage.

**Literal Translation** - a translation that focuses on keeping the form of the original text unchanged, even if the meaning changes as a result.

**Meaning-based Translation** - a translation that focuses on keeping the meaning of the original text unchanged, even if the form changes as a result.
