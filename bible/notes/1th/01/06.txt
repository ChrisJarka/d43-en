\v 6 We have now heard that you have endured your troubles when people caused you to suffer because you believed in Christ. You endured just as the Lord Jesus Christ endured, and just as we also did. At that time the Holy Spirit made you very joyful.
\v 7 Because you endured suffering, all the believers who live in the provinces of Macedonia and Achaia have learned how they also should trust God while enduring suffering.
