\v 27 Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at
the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
\v 28 Take you again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king
of Judah has burned.
\v 29 And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, Thus says Jehovah: You have burned this roll, saying, Why have
you written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from
thence man and beast?
