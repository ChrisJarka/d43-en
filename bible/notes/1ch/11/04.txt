\v 4 David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). Now the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.
\v 5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You will not come in here." But David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
\v 6 David had said, "Whoever attacks the Jebusites first will become a commander." So Joab son of Zeruiah attacked first, so he was made a commander.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **David and all Israel** - Here the phrase "all Israel" represents the entire Israelite army. AT: "David and all the Israelite army" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Now the Jebusites ... were there** - The word "now" is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the narrator tells background information about Jerusalem. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **David took the stronghold of Zion** - Here the word "took" is an idiom that means "captured" or "conquered." Since David lead the army, his name here is a synecdoche for the whole army who attacked the city. AT: "David captured the stronghold of Zion" or "David and the Israelite army captured the stronghold of Zion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the stronghold of Zion ... the city of David** - Both of these names refer to Jerusalem.
  * **so he was made a commander** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "so David made Joab a commander" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
