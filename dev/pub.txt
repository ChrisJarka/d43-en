====== unfoldingWord OBS Publishing ======

==== Goal: Functional OBS text publishing by August 3rd* ====

* Note: the system works now, but we need it to work without Jesse's involvement ;)

==== Current State ====

We are about 75% complete.

The black indicates parts of the process that are deployed and functional.

The red indicates parts of the process that are not deployed or that need work to become fully functional.
