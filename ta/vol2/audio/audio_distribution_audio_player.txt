===== Audio Players =====

//This answers the question:// //How suitable are audio players for offline use?//

There are many audio players being produced today by electronics manufacturers and ministry organizations. The ministry organizations have taken into consideration the many challenging contexts across the world in which people want to be able to listen to Biblical content and have designed players to meet that criteria. An example of a device designed for an incredible level of versatility, durability and utility is the MegaVoice Envoy S player. The Envoy S is approximately the size and shape of a basic mobile phone and has many features highly tuned to the needs of recording teams, ministry leaders and end-users. Some of these features include:

  * Field programmable via miniUSB 
  * Tamper proof onboard memory
  * Intuitive, tactile touch navigation buttons make navigation around any audio content such as Scripture, stories or lessons very easy (especially the book, chapter verse structure of Biblical content)
  * End-user can bookmark their location at the end of a listening session
  * Extremely durable (proven to withstand being crushed by heavy vehicles)
  * Can withstand hot, cold, wet and dry climate conditions
  * Includes built-in speaker for individual or small group listening
  * Headphone jack for private listening
  * Built-in solar panel for recharging long-life, lithium-ion battery
  * MiniUSB port for additional recharging options including power adapter, laptop USB port or other recharging technology
  * Can play continuously for hours on a single charge

A feature set such as this on an audio player can provide a tremendous degree of needed flexibility, intuitiveness and self-sufficiency valued by ministry leaders, families and communities alike.

Dedicated audio players offer many advantages over options like mobile phones or radios, but they also have disadvantages that should also be considered. Typically, these audio players:

  * are not readily available in many local areas, making the hardware more difficult to obtain and service locally (typically serviced through regional distributors)
  * require a financial investment upfront, typically by a mission-minded church or organization that is able to absorb costs that would otherwise be too expensive for many end-users

It is important to mention that organizations creating audio players are not doing so in order to "sell hardware" as a lucrative money making idea. On the contrary, the task of designing, testing and manufacturing field-worthy devices is an incredibly difficult and expensive. These devices are optimized for the needs of end-users and are more durable than cheap, consumer-grade electronics. To accomplish all of this and make them available at a mission-minded price point requires great vision and commitment to the goal of enabling people to hear God's message in their own language. Without these kinds of audio players, many people would not be listening to Biblical content.
