\v 32 Joseph's bones, which the Israelite people had brought up there from Egypt, were buried at Shechem. The people buried them in the piece of land that Jacob had bought long ago for a hundred pieces of silver from Hamor, the father of Shechem. That piece of land was in the area that was given to the people who were descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh, Joseph's sons.
\v 33 Eleazar, the supreme priest, the son of Aaron, also died. They buried his body at Gibeah, in the area that had been given to Eleazar's son Phinehas, in the hilly area that belonged to the people who were descendants of Ephraim.
