\v 17 These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved.
\v 18 For, uttering great swelling words of vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from them that live in error;
\v 19 promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage.
