===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Live reverently because you know that it was not with things like gold and silver—things that will not last forever—that God bought you, so you could stop behaving foolishly, as you learned to do from your ancestors.
\v 19 Instead, it was with the precious blood of Christ that flowed from his body when he died that God bought you. Christ was a like the lambs that the Jewish priests sacrificed: perfect, without any blemishes or spots.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 You know that it was not with silver or gold—perishable things, that you have been redeemed from the foolish behavior that you learned from your fathers,
\v 19 but with the honored blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.
