=== Who wrote the Book of 2 John? ===

The letter of 1 John was written by the Apostle John between 50 and 100 years after the birth of Christ.  John does not identify himself as the author, instead he calls himself the elder.  The content of 2 John closely resembles the content found in The Gospel according to John. This is especially apparent in the way he emphasizes Jesus’ command to love one another and in the way he equates loving Jesus with following his commands (1:5-6, John 15:9-10).  It is believed that John wrote The Gospel according to John and the three letters 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John while living in Ephesus.
