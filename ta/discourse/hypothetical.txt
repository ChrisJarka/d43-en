====== Hypothetical Situations ======
A hypothetical situation is a possible scenario which can happen in the past, present or future.  This situation may or may not actually be true.  It could possibly happen or it may never happen.
A hypothetical situation might mean asking a “what if” question.  It might be a “suppose” or “if only” statement. 
Hypothetical situations are good teaching tools. Jesus often used them in his teaching.

===== Examples from English =====

===== Examples from the Bible =====
Consider a hypothetical situation that **would never happen**:

In Luke chapter 18 verse 25 Jesus was teaching his disciples about how being rich can make it hard to enter God’s kingdom. To emphasize this, he said that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to submit to God’s rule in their life. 

The hypothetical part of this is that a large camel could never squeeze through a very small sewing needle!  Jesus used this hypothetical scenario to emphasize his teaching point.

----
Consider a “suppose” scenario that **could possibly happen**.  

In Matthew chapter 12 verse 11, Jesus was pointing out to the religious leaders that they were not being honest when they judged people for working on the Sabbath day. He told them, “Suppose, one of you has a sheep and it falls into a deep hole on the Sabbath day. Certainly you would work to pull it out of the hole!”
 
Jesus wasn’t talking about a specific person who did this. Rather he was talking about a true and possible situation which could and often did happen.    

----
An example of a future hypothetical situation is in found in Luke 17:34, Jesus says that //when he returns, two women will be working beside each other and one will be taken while the other one will be left behind.//

This is a hypothetical scenario because Jesus isn’t talking about specific women who will do this, but rather, he is talking about a general situation that **could possibly happen in the future**.  

----
The following is an example of a hypothetical scenario **in the past**:

In Matthew 11:21, Jesus said that //if the people living in the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon had been able to see the miracles that he – Jesus – performed, they would have repented long ago.//

This is a hypothetical situation that we know did not happen.  Jesus was making the spiritual teaching point of “what if” these people had seen the miracles?  If they had seen the miracles, then they would have repented.  

----
Sometimes a hypothetical situation **expresses an emotion, such as regret**.  For example, consider this sentence:

“//If only I had fed the dog, then he would not have chewed my shoes and ruined them//.”  

It is true that the dog chewed and consequently ruined the shoes. It is implied that the person is feeling the emotion of regret. The hypothetical part of this scenario is the assumption that since the dog did not get fed, that is the reason for his chewing on the shoes.   

===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * How would your language would express a situation that could never happen?
  * How you would communicate a “suppose” scenario that could happen right now?
  * Does your language have a special way of indicating a hypothetical situation in the past?
  * How does your language expresses an “if only” or “I wish” scenario which also implies some emotion. 

It is important in translation to be able to recognize a hypothetical situation in the text and use appropriate words or phrases.  You may need to show that the situation is in the past, present or future.  The possible scenario might be true or not likely to be true.  The situation could possibly happen, or would never happen.

Hypothetical situations may or may not imply emotions or reasons.  Some hypothetical statements may use expressions such as “what if”, “suppose” or “if only” to help the reader understand the spiritual teachings.  
 
Perhaps your language uses special wording or specific language structures to communicate each of these things.
