\v 15 And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.
\v 16 And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the
earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them.
\v 17 When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature
was in them.
