\v 18 And as the children of your people speak to you and say, ‘Will you not report to up what these things of yours are?’
\v 19 Declare to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold! I am taking the branch of Joseph that is in the hand of Ephraim and the tribes of Israel his companions and setting it upon the branch of Judah and they will form one branch, and they will be one within my hand!’
\v 20 So the two branches that you wrote upon them will be in your hand before their eyes.
