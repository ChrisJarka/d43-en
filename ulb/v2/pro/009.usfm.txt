\c 9
\q
\v 1 Wisdom has builded her house;
\q She has hewn out her seven pillars:
\q
\v 2 She has killed her beasts; she has mingled her wine;
\q She has also furnished her table:
\q
\v 3 She has sent forth her maidens;
\q She cries upon the highest places of the city:
\q
\v 4 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither:
\q As for him that is void of understanding, she says to him,
\q
\v 5 Come, eat you of my bread,
\q And drink of the wine which I have mingled.
\q
\v 6 Leave off, you simple ones, and live;
\q And walk in the way of understanding.
\b
\q
\v 7 He that correcteth a scoffer gets to himself reviling;
\q And he that reproves a wicked man gets himself a blot.
\q
\v 8 Reprove not a scoffer, lest he hate thee:
\q Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.
\q
\v 9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:
\q Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
\q
\v 10 The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom;
\q And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
\q
\v 11 For by me your days shall be multiplied,
\q And the years of your life shall be increased.
\q
\v 12 If you are wise, you are wise for thyself;
\q And if you scoffest, you alone shall bear it.
\b
\q
\v 13 The foolish woman is clamorous;
\q She is simple, and knows nothing.
\q
\v 14 And she sits at the door of her house,
\q On a seat in the high places of the city,
\q
\v 15 To call to them that pass by,
\q Who go right on their ways:
\q
\v 16 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither;
\q And as for him that is void of understanding, she says to him,
\q
\v 17 Stolen waters are sweet,
\q And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
\q
\v 18 But he knows not that the dead are there;
\q That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
