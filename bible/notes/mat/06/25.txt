\v 25 "Because\add you should be concerned about what God thinks is important and not about material goods, I\add* tell you that you should not worry about \add things that you need in order to\add* live. \add Do not worry\add* about whether you will have \add enough food\add* to eat, and \add things\add* to drink, or \add enough\add* clothes to wear. It is important to have \add sufficient\add* food \add and drink\add* and clothing, but the way you conduct your lives is much more important \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\v 26 Look at the birds. They do not plant \add seeds, and they do not\add* harvest \add crops\add* and gather \add produce\add* into barns. \add They always have food to eat because God\add*, your Father who is in heaven, provides food for them. And you are certainly worth a lot more than birds \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! \add So you can be assured that God will supply what you need!\add*

\v 25 Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yout for your body,
what you shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment?
\v 26 Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father
feedeth them. Are not you of much more value than they?
