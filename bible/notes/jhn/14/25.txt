\v 25 I have spoken these to you while I am still with you.
\v 26 But the Helper, the one who comes alongside to be with you, my Father will send him in my name. He will teach you all you need to know. He will also cause you to remember all the things that I have told you.
\v 27 As I leave you with peace, my peace I give to you. I give you peace that is not from this world. So, do not be upset or anxious, and do not be afraid.

\v 25 These things have I spoken to you, while yet living with you.
\v 26 But the Comforter, even the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things,
and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.
\v 27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you: not as the world giveth, give I to you. Let not your heart be
troubled, neither let it be fearful.
