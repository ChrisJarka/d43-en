\v 6 That same day the king commanded the Egyptian slave bosses and the \add Israelite\add* men supervising the slaves,
\v 7 "Do not continue to give the \add Israelite\add* people straw for making bricks, as you have done previously. Make them go \add into the fields\add* and gather straw for themselves.
\v 8 But require them to make the same number of bricks that they did before. Do not decrease the number at all. They are lazy\f + \ft Or: do not have enough work to do \f*. That is the reason they are asking me to let them go \add into the desert\add* to offer sacrifices to their god.
\v 9 Force the men to work harder, so that they will not \add have time\add* to listen to lies \add from their leaders\add*!"

\v 6 That same day the king commanded the Egyptian slave bosses and the Israelite assistants who directed the slaves,
\v 7 "Do not give the Israelite people straw for making bricks, unlike what you have done before. Make them go into the fields and gather straw for themselves.
\v 8 But still force them to make the same number of bricks that they did before. Do not lower the number at all. They do not want to work. That is the reason they are asking me to let them go into the wilderness to worship their god.
\v 9 Make the men work harder, so that they will not have time to listen to lies from their leaders!"

\v 6 That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen, saying,
\v 7 "You will no longer give the people straw to make brick, unlike before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
\v 8 But the  same number of the bricks which they made before, you will still require from them. Do not reduce anything required, for they are lazy. That is why they cry, saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'"
\v 9 Increase the work for the men, so that they keep at it and pay no attention to lying words."
