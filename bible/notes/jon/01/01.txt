<usfm> \v 1 One day Yahweh said to the prophet Jonah, the son of Amittai, \v 2 "I have seen how wicked the people are who live in the great city of Nineveh.

He went down to the city of Joppa. There he bought a ticket to travel on a ship that was going to the city of Tarshish.

<usfm> \c 1 \p \v 1 Now the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, \v 2 "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and speak out against it, because their wickedness has risen up before me." \v 3 But Jonah rose up to run away from the presence of Yahweh and go to Tarshish. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and boarded the ship to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of Yahweh. </usfm>
