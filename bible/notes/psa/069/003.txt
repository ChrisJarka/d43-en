====== Psalms 069:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 I am exhausted from calling out \add for help\add*;
\q2 my throat is very dry.
\q1 Because I have cried so much as I have waited for God \add to help me\add*,
\q2 my eyes are swollen.
\q1
\v 4 Those who hate me when there is no reason to hate me
\q2 are more than the number of hairs on my head \f + \ft hyperbole \f*!
\q1 Those who want to get rid of me are strong,
\q2 and they tell lies about me.
\q1 They demand that I return to them things that I did not steal!
\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried:
\q Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
\q
\v 4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head:
\q They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty:
\q That which I took not away I have to restore.
</usfm>
