\c 9
\p
\v 1 Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?
\v 2 If to others I am not an apostle, yout at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are you in the Lord.
\v 3 My defence to them that examine me is this.
\v 4 Have we no right to eat and to drink?
\v 5 Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord,
and Cephas?
\v 6 Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?
\v 7 What soldier ever serves at his own charges? who plants a vineyard, and eats not the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a
flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?
\v 8 Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or says not the law also the same?
\v 9 For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that
God careth,
\v 10 or says he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that plows ought to plow in hope,
and he that thresheth, to thresh in hope of partaking.
\v 11 If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?
\v 12 If others partake of this right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we
bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
\v 13 Know you not that they that minister about sacred things eat
of the things of the temple, and they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?
\v 14 Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.
\v 15 But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for
it were good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
\v 16 For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is to me, if I preach
not the gospel.
\v 17 For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me.
\v 18 What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the
full my right in the gospel.
\v 19 For though I was free from all men, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.
\v 20 And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being
myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
\v 21 to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain
them that are without law.
\v 22 To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save
some.
\v 23 And I do all things for the gospelâ€™s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.
\v 24 Know you not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that you may attain.
\v 25 And every man that strives in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they
do it to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
\v 26 I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air:
\v 27 but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should
be rejected.
