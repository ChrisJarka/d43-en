**The battle against the Philistines**

Jonathan took his armor bearer to where the Philistines were on the top of the hill. He said that God could use a few just as much as many people to win his battles. He and his armor bearer started killing the Philistines and suddenly they began fighting each other and running away. The rest of the Israeli who had hidden came and chased the Philistines. Saul told everyone that they must not eat before sundown, Jonathan was not there so did not hear what his father said. He found some honey on the ground and ate some. Saul was going to kill him but the people would not allow him to harm Jonathan.
