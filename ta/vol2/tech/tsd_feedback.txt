===== Using the Feedback Option in translationStudio =====

//This answers the question:// //How do I make a comment or report a problem?//

//In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read://

The Feedback option can be used for three major reasons:
    * Reporting errors
    * Asking questions about the program
    * Making suggestions about the program

NOTE: This will require an Internet connection.

=== Reporting Errors ===

Sometimes translationStudio may not work as expected.

At times the program may restart, also called a 'crash'. This is most likely not because of what the translator did. When this happens, the **Feedback** window will automatically open. The user will be asked to type in an explanation of what was being done just before the program stopped. Click the 'Submit' button when the information has been typed in. 

=== Asking Questions or Making Suggestions ===

At other times, the translator may have a question or they may want to make a suggestion about the program or content. The people that have worked on the program are very interested in what you, the user, think. **Please feel free to share any questions or comments.**

To ask a question or make a comment:
  - Click on the 3-dot menu found at the bottom left of the window. 
  - Choose **Feedback** from the list. 
  - Use the keyboard to type in your suggestion.
  - Click on **Confirm** at the bottom right of the Feedback window. Thank you!
