\v 30 Then Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 31 "Send this message to all the people \add from Judah\add* who are there \add in Babylon\add*: Say that this is what Yahweh says about Shemaiah, the man from Nehelam: 'I did not appoint him, but he has deceived you and caused you to believe the lies that he prophesied.
\v 32 So, I will punish him and his family. He has incited you to rebel against me. Because of that, all of his descendants will soon die. I will do many good things for you, my people, but he and his descendants will not see those things, \add because they will be dead\add*. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!'~"

\v 30 Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah, saying,
\v 31 Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus says Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah
has prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he has caused you to trust in a lie;
\v 32 therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to
dwell among this people, neither shall he behold the good that I will do to my people, says Jehovah, because he has spoken
rebellion against Jehovah.
