\v 6 And I heard one speaking to me out of the house; and a man stood by me.
\v 7 And he said to me, Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I
will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither
they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, and by the dead bodies of their kings
in their high places;
