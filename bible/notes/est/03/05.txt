\v 5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
\v 6 But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: wherefore
Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
