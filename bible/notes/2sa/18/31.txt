\v 31 And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Tidings for my lord the king; for Jehovah has avenged you this day
of all them that rose up against thee.
\v 32 And the king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my
lord the king, and all that rise up against you to do you hurt, be as that young man is.
\v 33 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son
Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
