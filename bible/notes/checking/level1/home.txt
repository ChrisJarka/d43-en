====== Level 1 Checking (Translator) ======

Level 1 checking will be done by the translator or translation group. It is assumed that they will be native speakers of or fluent in the language. The purpose of this level is for the translator(s) to verify the following about themselves and the translation:

  * The translator is a capable local language speaker.
  * The translator has adequate national language skills to use the translation helps.
  * The translator is respected in their community as a follower of Christ.

  * The translation was done according to the translation notes and resources provided.

  * The translator tested the translation with other local speakers of the language using the comprehension questions for each chapter and any other method that proves helpful.

==== Translator's Use of Notes ====

The translators should verify that their translation was done according to the translation notes and resources provided.

The notes consist of:

  * Introductory materials for each book
  * Translation Notes for each chunk of verses
  * Important Terms pages for significant words or phrases
  * Translation Academy links to explain translation principles

The notes contain a wealth of information about every verse in the book. In order to achieve a Level 1, translators must verify that they read the notes and, to the best of their ability, used the notes to guide the way they translated the book.

==== Translation Checking with Comprehension Questions ====

The translators should verify that they have used the comprehension questions that have been developed for each chapter of a book. The translators should use these questions to test whether the translation is clear and that it accurately conveys the meaning of the verses.

When each portion of the translation is ready, it should be presented to local speakers of the language for them to hear or read. Next, the translators should ask the audience the comprehension questions for that portion of the book. This will allow the translators to determine if the meaning of the translation was correctly understood. It is important that the audience __not __ have any other translation of the Bible in front of them when they are answering these questions.

A number of [[:en:bible:notes:checking:level1:other|other checking methods]] should also be used to ensure that the translation is easy to read and sounds natural to the listeners. For example, a translator can read a few verses and ask someone else to retell them in order to check their clarity and naturalness. Someone can also be asked to read a portion of the translation to show how easy or how difficult it is to read.
