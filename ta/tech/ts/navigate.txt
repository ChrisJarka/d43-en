===== Navigate in translationStudio =====

The first time you use translationStudio, the app will prompt you to set your languages and then return you to the **Edit Screen**. Otherwise you will begin at the **Edit Screen**.

The video {{:en:ta:tech:translating_in_ts_-_obs_v2.mp4|Translating in translationStudio}}  shows how to navigate in the app.  You can watch the video or complete these steps to find the text you wish to translate:

  - Above the left side of the **Edit Screen**  select from **Projects**, **Chapters**  or **Frames**  to navigate between books, chapters, or specific sections of text.
      - Select **Projects**  to navigate between Open Bible Stories, The Old Testament, or the New Testament.
      - Select **Chapters **  to navigate between stories if you are in Open Bible Stories, or between books of the Bible if you are in the Old or New Testament.
      - Select **Frames **  to navigate between story paragraphs if you are in Open Bible Stories or verses in the Bible.
  - When you locate the frame where you want to work, you can swipe back and forth to move between frames of text.
