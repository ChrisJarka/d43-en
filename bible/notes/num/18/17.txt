\v 17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy: you shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor to Jehovah.
\v 18 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.
