====== stronghold, fortress, fortified ======

===== Definition: =====

The terms "stronghold" and "fortress" both refer to a safe place that is well protected against an attack by enemy soldiers. The term "fortified" describes a city or other place that has been made safe from attack.

  * Strongholds and fortresses can be manmade structures with defensive walls or they can be a place that has natural protective barriers such as rocky cliffs or high mountains.
  * People fortify strongholds by building thick walls or other structures that make it difficult for an enemy to break through.
  * This term is also used figuratively to refer to God as a stronghold or fortress for those who trust in him.
  * "Stronghold" or "fortress" could be translated as "securely strong place" or "strongly protected place."
  *  The term "fortified city" could be translated as "securely protected city" or "strongly built city."
  *  A figurative meaning for the term "stronghold" refers to something that someone wrongly trusts in for security, such as a false god. If possible, it is best to keep this metaphor and translate the term literally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
