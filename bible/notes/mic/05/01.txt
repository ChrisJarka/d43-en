\m
\q
\v 1 Now come together in battle ranks,
\q daughter of soldiers;
\q the soldiers have set up a siege around city,
\q with a rod they will strike the judge of Israel
\q on the cheek.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa come together in battle ranks \fqa* , some interpreters translate \fqa cut yourselves \fqa* , referring to the pagan practice of cutting oneself while praying to idols. Also, some modern versions follow an ancient version that reads \fqa build up your fortifications  \fqa* . \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **daughter of soldiers** - The people of a city are spoken of as if they were a woman. The soldiers are attacking the city. AT: "people of the city, whom soldiers are attacking" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and with a rod they will strike the judge of Israel on the cheek** - The rod is a metonym for a greater man punishing a lesser man with a rod. To strike a man on the cheek was to insult him more than to harm him. AT: "and Yahweh will punish the judge of Israel by having the invaders insult the judge of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the judge of Israel** - This irony describes the king as having lost so much of his power and authority that he is really only a judge. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
