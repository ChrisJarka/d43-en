\v 28 Everyone who rejected the laws \add that God gave\add* Moses was mercilessly killed when \add at least\add* two or three people testified that they had done that.
\v 29 \add That was severe punishment\add*. But \add Christ\add* is God's Son\f + \ft Or: the man who is also God \f*. His blood, by means of which \add he put into effect\add* the new covenant, is sacred. Because of \add Christ's\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* blood \add flowing for us when he died\add*, \add God\add* freed us from our guilt. So, you can be sure \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that anyone who shows contempt for \add those truths\add* and who insults the Spirit of God, the one who acts with kindness toward us in a way we do not deserve, deserves to be punished even worse than that \f + \ft metaphor \f*!

\v 28 Everyone who rejected the laws that God gave Moses was mercilessly killed when at least two or three people testified against the person who has rejected God's Law.
\v 29 That was severe punishment. But Christ is God's Son who is also God. His blood, by means of which he put into effect the new covenant, is sacred. Because of Christ's blood flowing for us when he died, God freed us from our guilt. So, you can be sure that anyone who shows contempt for those truths and who insults the Spirit of God, the one who acts with kindness toward us in a way we do not deserve, deserves to be punished even worse than that!

\v 28 A man who has rejected the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the word of two or three witnesses.
\v 29 How much more punishment, do you think a person is worthy to receive who has trampled over the Son of God and has treated the blood of the covenant as something unholy, the blood by which he was sanctified and the Spirit of grace he has insulted?
