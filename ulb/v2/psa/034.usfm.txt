\c 34
\d A Psalm of David; when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.
\q
\v 1 I will bless Jehovah at all times:
\q His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
\q
\v 2 My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah:
\q The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad.
\q
\v 3 Oh magnify Jehovah with me,
\q And let us exalt his name together.
\q
\v 4 I sought Jehovah, and he answered me,
\q And delivered me from all my fears.
\q
\v 5 They looked to him, and were radiant;
\q And their faces shall never be confounded.
\q
\v 6 This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard him,
\q And saved him out of all his troubles.
\q
\v 7 The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him,
\q And delivers them.
\q
\v 8 Oh taste and see that Jehovah is good:
\q Blessed is the man that takes refuge in him.
\q
\v 9 Oh fear Jehovah, you his saints;
\q For there is no lack to them that fear him.
\q
\v 10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger;
\q But they that seek Jehovah shall not lack any good thing.
\q
\v 11 Come, you children, listen to me:
\q I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.
\q
\v 12 What man is he that desires life,
\q And loves many days, that he may see good?
\q
\v 13 Keep your tongue from evil,
\q And your lips from speaking guile.
\q
\v 14 Depart from evil, and do good;
\q Seek peace, and pursue it.
\q
\v 15 The eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous,
\q And his ears are open to their cry.
\q
\v 16 The face of Jehovah is against them that do evil,
\q To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
\q
\v 17 The righteous cried, and Jehovah heard,
\q And delivered them out of all their troubles.
\q
\v 18 Jehovah is near to them that are of a broken heart,
\q And saves such as are of a contrite spirit.
\q
\v 19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous;
\q But Jehovah delivers him out of them all.
\q
\v 20 He keeps all his bones:
\q Not one of them is broken.
\q
\v 21 Evil shall kill the wicked;
\q And they that hate the righteous shall be condemned.
\q
\v 22 Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his servants;
\q And none of them that take refuge in him shall be condemned.
