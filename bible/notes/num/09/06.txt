\v 6 There were certain men who became unclean by the body of a dead man. They could not keep the Passover on that day. They came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.
\v 7 Those men said to him, "We are unclean because of a dead man. Why do you keep us away that we may not offer the sacrifice to Yahweh in the appointed season among the descendants of Israel?"
\v 8 And Moses said to them, "Wait for me to hear what Yahweh will command concerning you."
