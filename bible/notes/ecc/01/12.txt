===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 I, the Religious Teacher, have been the king of Israel \add for many years, ruling\add* in Jerusalem.
\v 13 By using my wisdom, I concentrated on understanding everything that was being done on the earth \f + \ft metonymy \f*. But I found out that God causes all of us to experience things that cause us to be unhappy\f + \ft Or: miserable \f*.
\v 14 It seems that nothing that happens on the earth really enables us to do anything useful. It is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* chasing the wind.
\b
\q1
\v 15 \add Many things\add* that are crooked cannot be caused to become straight;
\q2 we cannot count things that do not exist.

<usfm>
\v 12 I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
\v 13 I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven; it is a burdensome task  that God has given to the sons of men to be busy with.
\v 14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and, behold, all is vapor and a striving after wind.
\v 15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is lacking cannot be numbered.
