\v 30 We must conclude this: Although the non-Jews were not trying to be holy, they discovered that God would put them right with himself if they trusted in Christ.
\v 31 But the people of Israel did indeed try to be holy by obeying God's law, but they were not able to.

\v 30 What will we say then? That the Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness, obtained righteousness, the righteousness by faith.
\v 31 But Israel, who did pursue a law of righteousness, did not arrive at it.
