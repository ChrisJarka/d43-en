<usfm>
\v 9 So God honored him very much,
\q2 honored him more than anyone else who has ever lived, 
\q1
\v 10 so that when everyone hears the name "Jesus" 
\q2 they will bow down to honor him,
\q2 everyone in heaven, on earth, and under the earth;
\q1
\v 11 so that everyone will acknowledge
\q2 that Jesus Christ is Lord,
\q2 and they will praise God the Father because of him.

<usfm>
\q 
\v 9 Therefore God also highly exalted him. 
\q2 He gave him the name that is above every name.
\q 
\v 10 He did this so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend, 
\q2 the knees of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
\q 
\v 11 And he did this so that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, 
\q2 to the glory of God the Father.
