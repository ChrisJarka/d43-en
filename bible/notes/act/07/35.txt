\v 35 This Moses is the one who had tried to help our Israelite people, but whom they rejected by saying, 'No one appointed you ruler and judge!' Moses is the one whom God himself sent to rule them and to free them from being slaves. He is the one whom an angel in the bush commanded to do that.
\v 36 Moses is the one who led our ancestors out from Egypt. He did many kinds of miracles in Egypt in order to show that God was with him, at the Red Sea, and during the forty years that the Israelite people lived in the wilderness.
\v 37 This Moses is the one who said to the Israelite people, 'God will cause another man from among your own people to be a prophet like me for you.'

\v 35 This Moses whom they rejected, when they said, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'--he was the one whom God sent by the power of the angel who appeared to Moses in the bush--he sent  him to be both a ruler and a rescuer.

\v 36 Moses led them out of Egypt, after doing miracles and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness during forty
years.
\v 37 It is the same Moses who said to the people of Israelites, 'God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, a prophet like me.'

  * **he was the one ... to Moses in the bush** - This part of a complex sentence with passives. It can be translated as, "God sent Moses to rule them and to free them from being slaves.
