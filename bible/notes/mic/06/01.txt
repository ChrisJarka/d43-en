===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Arise and state your case before the mountains; let the hills hear your voice** - Micah is using the mountains and hills as an eternal witness against his peoples Idolatry. AT: The mountains and hills have seen all, please state your case before them. (see:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
    * **Listen to Yahweh’s lawsuit** - Micah again turns to a lawsuit, as he did in the first chapter. God is not pleased with his people, but he does not act impetuously by calling the mountains and hills as a witness, he is trying expose the root of his peoples failure.
