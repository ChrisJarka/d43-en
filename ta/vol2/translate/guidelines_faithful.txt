==== Faithful Translations ====

To make a translation that is faithful to the Bible, you must avoid any political, denominational, ideological, social, cultural, or theological bias in your translation. Your goal as a Bible translator is to communicate the same message that the original writer of the Bible intended to communicate. This means that you should not try to communicate your own message, or the message that you think the Bible should say, or that your church thinks that the Bible should say. For any Bible passage, you must communicate what it says, all of what it says, and only what it says. You must resist the temptation to put any of your own interpretations or messages into the Bible or add any meaning to the message that is not there in the Bible passage.

Use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. 

Always translating faithfully can be difficult for several reasons.

  - You might be used to the way that your church interprets some Bible passages, and not know that there are other interpretations.
  Example: Baptism
  - You might assume that a Bible passage means one thing because that makes sense in your culture, but in the culture of the Bible it meant something else.
  Example: divorce in America
  - You might not like something that the Bible says, and be tempted to change it.
  Example: 
  - You might be afraid of what others in your village will think or do if they read a faithful translation of what the Bible says.
  Example: Son of God

In order to avoid these biases, especially the ones that you might not be aware of, you must study the translationNotes, translationWords, and the UDB, as well as any other translation helps that you have. That way you will know what the message of the different Bible passages is, and you will be less likely to translate in a biased, unfaithful way.


To create a **FAITHFUL** translation of the Bible means that the translator, to the best of his ability, makes sure that each Bible passage he translates has the meaning that the writer of that Bible passage intended it to communicate. In order to do this, he will need to study translation helps prepared by Bible scholars, such as translationNotes and the UDB. The translator also needs to identify the translationWords and the unknown ideas in the text that are ambiguous or difficult to understand, and translate these parts consistently and faithfully.
  * Identify the translationWords of the original text. Translate these words or phrases consistently and faithfully for both the Bible stories and Bible.
  * When you come to unknown ideas or places that are ambiguous or difficult to understand, use the unfoldingWord biblical resources to see how others suggest you can translate these. 

=== translationWords ===
To translate translationWords, follow these four steps:
  - Study the meaning of the original word.
  - Compare the word with other words of similar meaning.
  - Think of possible ways to translate the term. Choose one to try.
  - Test the term you have chosen to see if others understand the meaning.
The goal of faithful translations is to translate the meaning of the original message clearly, accurately and naturally, keeping the author’s main focus in mind.

**Remember**: translationWords should be translated consistently.
=== Unknown Ideas ===
Sometimes a thing or custom is unknown in the target language. Possible solutions are to use a descriptive phrase, substitute something similar, use a foreign word from another language, use a more general word or use more specific words. See the lesson on [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] for more information.

One kind of ‘unknown idea’ are words that refer to Jewish and Christian religious customs and beliefs. Some common unknown ideas are:

**Names of places** such as:
  * Temple (a building where the Israelites offered sacrifices to God)
  * Synagogue (a building where Jewish people assemble to worship God)
  * Sacrificial alter (a raised structure on which sacrifices were burned as gifts, or offerings, to God.)
**Titles of people who hold an office** such as:
  * Priest (someone who is chosen to relate to God on behalf of his people)
  * Pharisee (important group of Israel’s religious leaders in Jesus’ time)
  * Prophet (person who speaks God’s messages to people)
  * Son of Man
  * Son of God
  * King (ruler of an independent city, state or country).
**Key Biblical Concepts** such as:
  * Forgiveness (to not resent that person and not be angry at him for doing something hurtful)
  * Salvation (being saved or rescued from evil, enemies, or from danger)
  * Redemption (the act of buying back something that was previously owned or that was held captive)
  * Mercy (helping people who are in need)
  * Grace (help or regard that is given to someone who has not earned it).

Use terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Terms addressing the relationship between God the Father and God the Son should be retained in translated content and clarified, if needed.
