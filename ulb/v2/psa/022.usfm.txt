\c 22
\d For the Chief Musician; set to Aijaleth hash-Shahar. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
\q Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?
\q
\v 2 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you answerest not;
\q And in the night season, and am not silent.
\q
\v 3 But you are holy,
\q O you that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
\q
\v 4 Our fathers trusted in thee:
\q They trusted, and you did deliver them.
\q
\v 5 They cried to thee, and were delivered:
\q They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame.
\q
\v 6 But I am a worm, and no man;
\q A reproach of men, and despised of the people.
\q
\v 7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn:
\q They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
\q
\v 8 Commit yourself to Jehovah;
\q let him deliver him:
\q Let him rescue him, seeing he delights in him.
\q
\v 9 But you are he that took me out of the womb;
\q You did make me trust when I was upon my mother’s breasts.
\q
\v 10 I was cast upon you from the womb;
\q You are my God since my mother bare me.
\q
\v 11 Be not far from me; for trouble is near;
\q For there is none to help.
\q
\v 12 Many bulls have compassed me;
\q Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
\q
\v 13 They gape upon me with their mouth,
\q As a ravening and a roaring lion.
\q
\v 14 I am poured out like water,
\q And all my bones are out of joint:
\q My heart is like wax;
\q It is melted within me.
\q
\v 15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd;
\q And my tongue clings to my jaws;
\q And you have brought me into the dust of death.
\q
\v 16 For dogs have compassed me:
\q A company of evil-doers have inclosed me;
\q They pierced my hands and my feet.
\q
\v 17 I may count all my bones.
\q They look and stare upon me;
\q
\v 18 They part my garments among them,
\q And upon my vesture do they cast lots.
\q
\v 19 But be not you far off, O Jehovah:
\q O you my succor, haste you to help me.
\q
\v 20 Deliver my soul from the sword,
\q My darling from the power of the dog.
\q
\v 21 Save me from the lion’s mouth;
\q Yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen you have answered me.
\b
\q
\v 22 I will declare your name to my brethren:
\q In the midst of the assembly will I praise thee.
\q
\v 23 You that fear Jehovah, praise him;
\q All you the seed of Jacob, glorify him;
\q And stand in awe of him, all you the seed of Israel.
\q
\v 24 For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted;
\q Neither has he hid his face from him;
\q But when he cried to him, he heard.
\q
\v 25 Of you comes my praise in the great assembly:
\q I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
\q
\v 26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied;
\q They shall praise Jehovah that seek after him:
\q Let your heart live for ever.
\q
\v 27 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Jehovah;
\q And all the kindred of the nations shall worship before thee.
\q
\v 28 For the kingdom is Jehovah’s;
\q And he is the ruler over the nations.
\q
\v 29 All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship:
\q All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him,
\q Even he that cannot keep his soul alive.
\q
\v 30 A seed shall serve him;
\q It shall be told of the Lord to the next generation.
\q
\v 31 They shall come and shall declare his righteousness
\q To a people that shall be born, that he has done it.
