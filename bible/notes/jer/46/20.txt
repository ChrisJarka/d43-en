\q2 but a powerful king from the northeast is surely coming to attack it
\q2 like a horsefly bites a cow.
\q1
\v 21 The mercenaries that Egypt has hired are like fat calves because of the Egyptians' money;
\q2 but they also will turn around and run away;
\q1 they will not stand there and fight,
\q2 because it will be a day when there will be a great disaster for Egypt,
\q2 a day when their people will be greatly punished.
\q1
\v 22 The soldiers of Egypt will run away,
\q2 as silently as a snake slithers away.

\q
\v 20 Egypt is a very beautiful young cow, but a stinging insect is coming from the north. It is coming.
\q
\v 21 The hired soldiers in her midst are like a fattened bull, but they will also turn away and run away.
\q They will not stand together, for the day of their disaster is coming against them, the time of their punishment.
\q
\v 22 Egypt hisses like a snake and crawls away, for her enemies are marching against her.
\q They are going toward her like woodcutters with axes.
