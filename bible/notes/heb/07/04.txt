\v 4 Now consider how great this man was, to whom father Abraham gave a tenth out of the best goods seized in the war of the kings.
\v 5 And indeed those descendants of Levi who receive the priestâ€™s office have a commandment to collect  tithes from the people according to the law of their brothers, though they too are descendants of Abraham.
