\v 11 So this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say to you, Ezekiel: Slap your hands and stamp your feet and cry out to show that you are distressed, and groan about what will happen to the Israelite people  because of all their wicked and detestable behavior. They will be killed by their enemies' swords, they will die from hunger, and they will die from plagues.
\v 12 Those who are far from Jerusalem will die from plagues, those who are close to Jerusalem will be killed by their enemies' swords. Those who are still alive after that will die from hunger. That is how I will punish  them.

\v 11 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Clap your hand and stomp your foot! Say 'Alas!' because of all the evi abominations of the house of Israe!
For they will fall by sword, famine, and plague.
\v 12 The one far away will die by plauge, and the one that is near willl fall by the sword. Those who remain and survive that will die by famine;
and so I will accomplish my fury against them.
