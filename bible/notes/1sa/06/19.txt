===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they had looked into the ark** - The ark was so holy that no one was permitted to look inside it. Only the priests were allowed to even see the ark.
  * **He killed seventy men** - The meaning of the original language is not certain. Some versions of the Bible say "He killed 50,070 men." Some other versions of the Bible say "He killed 70 men out of 50,000 men."
  * **seventy men** - "70 men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God?** - Possible meanings are 1) This is a rhetorical question that expresses the people's fear of Yahweh. AT: "There is no one who can resist Yahweh because he is so holy!" or "Because Yahweh is holy, no one is good enough to stand in his presence!" or 2) this is a question asking for information. The ark represents Yahweh's presence and the people were looking for a priest who Yahweh would permit to handle the ark. AT: "Is there a priest among us who can stand in Yahweh's presence and handle this holy ark?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to whom will he go up from us?** - This is an information question to which the people were seeking an answer. Possible meanings are 1) "to whom will Yahweh go up from us?" or 2) "to whom will the ark go up from us?"
