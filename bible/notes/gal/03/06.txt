====== Galatians 03:6-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 \add What you have experienced is\add* as \add Moses wrote in the Scriptures about\add* Abraham. \add He wrote that Abraham\add* trusted God, and as a result, he was considered as being righteous \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* erased the record of his sins \f*.
\v 7 You must realize, therefore, that it is those who trust \add in what Christ has done who\add* are \add like\add* Abraham's descendants \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add because they trust in God as Abraham did\add*.
\v 8 Furthermore, God planned beforehand that it was \add when\add* non-Jews trusted \add him\add* that he would erase the record of their sins. \add Moses wrote in\add* the Scriptures \f + \ft personification \f* this good message that God told Abraham: "Because of \add what\add* you \add did\add*, I will bless \add people in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* all nations."
\v 9 So, \add we can conclude that\add* it is those who trust \add in what Christ has done\add* whom \add God\add* blesses. That includes \add all non-Jews and Jews who trust him\add*, along with Abraham, the one who trusted him \add long ago\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 What you have experienced is just as Moses had written in the scriptures about Abraham. He wrote that Abraham trusted God, and as a result God declared Abraham  good in his sight.
\v 7 You should realize, therefore, that it is those who trust in Christ to save them whom God has made into descendants of Abraham.
\v 8 Ever before God began to make non-Jews good in his sight when they trusted in him, men wrote in the scriptures that he would do this. God announced this Good News to Abraham, as we read in the scriptures, "Because of what you have done, I will bless all the people-groups in the world."
\v 9 So, we know by this that it is all those who trust in Christ whom God blesses along with Abraham.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 As Abraham "believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness,"
\v 7 understand, therefore, that they who believe are sons of Abraham.
\v 8 The scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith. The gospel was proclaimed  beforehand to Abraham--"In you all the nations will be blessed."
\v 9 So then those who have faith are blessed with Abraham.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **in you**  - "because of what you have done" (UDB) or "because I have blessed you"
  * **it was credited to him as righteousness**  - God saw Abraham's faith in him(God), so then God gave him(Abraham) righteousness.
  * **they who believe**  - "people who believe"
  * **sons of Abraham**  - "like the sons and daughters of Abraham." (See "Metaphor"). They are included in the Abrahamic covenant, which includes favor with God.
  * **foresaw**  - "predicted" or "saw before it happened" (see "Personification")
  * **all nations**  - "all the people-groups in the world" (UDB). God was emphasizing that he was not favoring only the Jewish people, his chosen group. His plan of salvation was for both Jews and non-Jews.
  * **have faith** - believe God
