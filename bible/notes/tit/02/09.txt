===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 About our brothers and their families who are slaves, they should always submit to their masters. As much as possible, they should arrange their lives in order to please their masters in every way, and are not to argue with them.
\v 10 Yes, all of our people who work for other people must not steal little things, but they should show that their hands can be trusted for good so that their behavior fits beautifully with all of our teaching about God our Savior.
