====== Ekron ======

===== Facts: =====

Ekron was a major city of the Philistines, located nine miles inland from the Mediterranean Sea.

  * A temple of the false god Baal-zebub was located at Ekron.
  * When the Philistines captured the ark of the covenant, they took it to Ashdod, then moved it to Gath and Ekron because God kept causing people to get sick and die in whatever city the ark was taken to. Finally the Philistines sent the ark back to Israel.
  * When King Ahaziah fell through the roof of his house and injured himself, messengers were sent to Ekron to ask the false god Baal-zebub if Ahaziah would recover from his injuries. Because Ahaziah went to a false god instead of the one true God, Yahweh said that he would die.
