===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jacob continues to bless Joseph and his descendants.

  * **the ancient mountains** - The meaning of the original language is not certain. Some Bible translations have "my ancestors" instead of "ancient mountains."
  * **They will be on the head of Joseph, blessings that crown the head of the one** - "They" refers to the blessings of his father. Jacob speaks of the blessing he gives Joseph as if it were a crown that a prince wears. This emphasizes that these blessings are a sign of Joseph's honor and that he has authority over his brothers. AT: "These blessings will be like a crown on Joseph's head" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **prince over his brothers** - "set apart from his brothers"
