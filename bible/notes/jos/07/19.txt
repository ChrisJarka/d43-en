\v 19 And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession to him;
and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.
\v 20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have
I done:
\v 21 when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty
shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the
silver under it.
