\v 29 My fellow believers, this is what I mean: There is not much time left \add before Christ returns\add*. So, from now on those men who are married should \add devote themselves to serving the Lord as much\add* as they would if they were not married.
\v 30 Those who are sad should \add devote themselves to serving the Lord as much\add* as they would if they were not sad. Those who are rejoicing \add should devote themselves to serving the Lord as much\add* as they would if they were not joyful.
\v 31 Those who are buying things should \add devote themselves to serving the Lord as much\add* as they would if they did not possess those things. Because this world as it exists now will soon be gone, those who are actively involved in the affairs of this life \add should not devote all their time\add* to be involved in those things.

\v 29 But this I say, brothers, the time is short.. From now on those that have wives may have to be as though they had none.
\v 30 And those that weep, as though they are not weeping; and those that rejoice, as though they are not rejoicing; and those that buy, as though they are not possessing.
\v 31 And those that use the world system, as not using it to the full  because the system of this world passes away.
