  * **farmer - ** alternate: "man of the soil"
  * **became drunk - ** alternate: "drank too much wine" the tone is disapproving, direct, and short
  * **uncovered - ** the text is not specific about what is uncovered as Noah lay in a drunken stupor. Because of the later reactions, it is presumed his genitals were exposed. Your culture may have a different threshold of exposure that is shameful.
