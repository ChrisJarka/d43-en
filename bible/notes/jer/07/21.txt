\v 21 Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat you flesh.
\v 22 For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning
burnt offerings or sacrifices:
\v 23 but this thing I commanded them, saying, Listen to my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and
walk you in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.
