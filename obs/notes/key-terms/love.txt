====== love ======


===== Definition: =====

To love another person is to care for that person and do things that will benefit him. There are different kinds of love, such as love for family and friends, and love for God or from God.

  * In the Old Testament there are several words that are translated as love in English. Other languages also have different words for love which are used in different contexts.
  * In the New Testament, there are two words for love. One word is used for the kind of love that God has. This kind of love is unselfish, sacrificial, and always thinks of what will be best for the person who is loved.
  * Jesus demonstrated this kind of love by sacrificing his life in order to rescue us from sin and death. He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially.
  * When people love others with this kind of love, it involves actions that are selfless and that cause the other person to thrive. This especially includes forgiving others.
  * A different word for love is used in the New Testament which refers to "brotherly love" or "love from a friend." This is natural human love between friends or relatives.
  * This word is also used in such contexts as, "they love to sit in the most important seats at a banquet."
  * Some languages have to express "love" as an action, so for example "Love is patient, love is kind…" would be translated as "When a person loves someone, he is patient with him and kind to him…"
