Possible meanings are 1) the man has dismounted his horse and now stood or 2) the word "stood" is an idiom that means he was located in that position. AT: "the man who was among the myrtle trees ... the angel of Yahweh who was among the myrtle trees" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **These are those ... They answered ... they said** - The words "these" and "they" refer to the red, reddish-brown, and white horses that were behind the man who was among the myrtle trees. Possible meanings are 1) it is implicit that there were other men who were riding the horses, and that these phrases refer to the riders or 2) the horses are personified as being able to speak like people.

  * **to roam throughout the earth** - It is implicit that Yahweh sent these out to walk about in order to patrol the earth. This does not suggest that they were wandering or lost. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **all the earth sits still and is at rest** - There being peace and quiet in the world is spoken of as if the earth were a person who is still and resting.

(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
