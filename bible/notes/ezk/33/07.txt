<usfm> \p \v 7 Now you yourself, son of man! I have established you as a watchman for the house of Israel, so you will hear the word from my mouth and warn them on my behalf. \v 8 When I say to the wicked, ‘Wicked one, you will certainly die!’ and you do not declare aloud to warn the wicked of his way, then he who is wicked will die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood from your hand! \v 9 But You, if you warn the wicked of his way, to repent from it, and he does not repent from his way, then he will die in his iniquity but you yourself will have delivered your life. </usfm>
