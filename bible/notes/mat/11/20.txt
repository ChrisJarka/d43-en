===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 20 The people, who lived in the towns in the area where Jesus was, saw him perform many miracles. But they did not turn away from their sinful behavior. So Jesus began to rebuke them by saying to them, \v 21 "You people who live in the city of Chorazin and you in the city of Bethsaida, how terribly you will suffer! I did great miracles in your cities, but you did not stop sinning. If I had done these things in the cities of Tyre and Sidon of long ago, those wicked people would certainly have stopped sinning; they would have put on rough clothing and sat in the cold ashes of their fires, so sorry they would have been. \v 22 Let me tell you this: God will punish the wicked people who lived in the cities of Tyre and Sidon, but he will punish you even more severely on the final day when he judges all people. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 20 Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his great deeds were done, because they had not repented. \v 21 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to thee, Bethsaida! For if in Tyre and Sidon there had been done the great deeds that were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. \v 22 But I say to you, it shall be easier for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

This starts a new section where Jesus is now talking to the people of the cities where He previously did miracles.

  * **rebuke the cities **- Jesus is here using a metonym, accusing the people of these cities of doing wrong. (See: Metonym)
  * **because they had not repented**  - The pronoun "they" refers to the people in the cities that had not repented.
  * **Chorazin, Bethsaida, Tyre, Sidon **- explanation (See: Metonym)
  * **they would have repented long ago **- The pronoun "they" refers here to the people of Tyre and Sidon.
  * **But I say to you**  and **than for you**. - The plural pronoun "you" refers to the people of Chorazin and Bethsaida.
  * **it shall be easier for Tyre and Sidon **- If necessary, this passive phrase can be translated "God will show more mercy to Tyre and Sidon" or as in the UDB. (See: Active or Passive)
