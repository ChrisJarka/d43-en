\v 3 We praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christâ€”he is the Father and source of every mercy he gave us, when all we deserve was his fierce anger. And he is the God from whom we receive every comfort from his hand.
\v 4 God comforts us in every affliction we go through. He show us his comfort and applies it to our hurts and sorrows, so that when we meet someone who is suffering an affliction of their own, we can share the comfort God gave to us and give it to them.
