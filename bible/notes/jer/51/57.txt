\q
\v 57 For I will make her princes, her sages, her officals, and her warriors drunk,
\q And they will sleep an unending sleep and never awaken!

\q
\v 58 Yahweh of Hosts says this: the thick walls of Babylon will be completely demolished,
\q And her high gates will be burned by fire!
\q Then people will labor for nothing, and nations for fire until they grow weary.
