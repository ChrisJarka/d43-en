===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 Many of the descendants of Levi deserted me along with most of the Israelite people, and started to worship idols. They must be punished for their sin.
\v 11 They are permitted to work in my temple and to be in charge of the gates of the temple, and they are permitted to slaughter the animals that will be completely burned on the altar, and to burn other sacrifices for the people, and they will be able to help the people.
\v 12 But because they helped the people to worship idols and caused many of the people of Israel to sin \add by worshiping idols\add*, I have lifted up my arm and solemnly declared that they must be punished for their sin.

\v 10 But the Levites that went far from me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.
\v 11 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
\v 12 Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, says the Lord Jehovah, and they shall bear their iniquity.
