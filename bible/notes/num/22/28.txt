\v 28 Then Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you that you have struck me these three times?"
\v 29 So Balaam replied to the donkey, "Because you acted wrecklessly with me. I wish there were a sword in my hand because by now I would have killed you."
\v 30 The donkey said to Balaam, "Am not I your donkey upon which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Have I ever been in the habit of doing such things to you before?"  Baalam said, "No."
