\c 124
\d A Song of Ascents; of David.
\q
\v 1 If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side,
\q Let Israel now say,
\q
\v 2 If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side,
\q When men rose up against us;
\q
\v 3 Then they had swallowed us up alive,
\q When their wrath was kindled against us:
\q
\v 4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us,
\q The stream had gone over our soul;
\q
\v 5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
\q
\v 6 Blessed be Jehovah,
\q Who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
\q
\v 7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
\q The snare is broken, and we are escaped.
\q
\v 8 Our help is in the name of Jehovah,
\q Who made heaven and earth.
