\v 24 When people run in a race, they all run, but only one of them wins the race and as a result gets a prize. You certainly know that.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So, \add just like\add* runners \add exert themselves fully to win a race\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add you should exert yourselves fully to do the things that God wants you to do\add*, in order that you may receive the reward \add that God wants to give you\add*.
\v 25 All athletes exercise their bodies strenuously in many ways. They do that in order to receive a wreath \add as a reward to wear on their heads\add*. Those wreaths fade, but we will receive a reward that will last forever \f + \ft litotes \f*.
\v 26 For that reason, I \add try hard to please God\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like a\add* runner who runs toward the goal \f + \ft litotes \f*. I \add try hard to accomplish what God wants me to accomplish, like\add* a boxer tries hard to hit his opponent, not to miss hitting him.
\v 27 I beat my body \add to make it do what I want it to do\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add as\add* slaves \add obey their masters\add*, in order that, after I have proclaimed \add God's message\add* to others, he will not \add say that I do\add* not deserve to receive a reward.

\v 24 You know when people run in a race, they all run, but only one of them wins the prize. So you should run the race with the purpose of winning the prize, not just to say you ran in a race, but that you finished the race.
\v 25 Every athlete exercises diligence in the way he trains. He is careful in every aspect of preparation. They are careful in every aspect of their preparation for the race because they want to win it. They are running for an wreath that is placed on the head. That wreath is the sign of winning; but that wreath quickly perishes and fades away. But we are running so we might receive an imperishable wreath that will last forever.
\v 26 Therefore, in everything I do, I have purpose, just like the runner in training. I do not waste my effort or exhaust myself by striking the air like a boxer who has no opponent.
\v 27 I make my body do what I want it to do. I make my body obey me and follow my commands, I treat it like my slave, so my focus is on finishing my race and not being disqualified because I wasn't discipled or was not able to do what God called me to do.

\v 24 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run the race,  but only one receives the prize? So run to win the prize.
\v 25 An athlete exercises self-control in all his training. They do it to receive a wreath that is perishable, but we run so that we might receive an imperishable wreath.
\v 26 Therefore I do not run without purpose or box by beating the air.
\v 27 But I subdue my body and make it a slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself may not be disqualified.
