\v 27 Our father replied, 'You know that my wife Rachel gave birth to two sons for me.
\v 28 One of them disappeared, and I said, "A wild animal has surely torn him to pieces." And I have not seen him since then.
\v 29 If you take this other one from me, too, and something harms him, you would cause me, an old gray-haired man, to die because of my sorrow.'
