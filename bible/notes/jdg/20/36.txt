\v 36-38 The main group of Israelite men arranged with the men who would be hiding that they should send up a smoke signal to enable the main group of soldiers to know when they should attack. Then the main group of Israelite men retreated for a short distance, because they knew that the other Israelite men \add who had been hiding on the other side\add* of Gibeah would attack the people of the tribe of Benjamin by surprise. So \add after the main group of Israelite men retreated a little distance\add*, the men who had been hiding rushed out and ran into Gibeah and used their swords to kill everyone in the city. \add Then they started to burn the buildings\add*.

\v 36-38 This is how it happened: The main group of Israelite men arranged with the men who would be hiding that they should set part of the city on fire, in order to send a thick plume of smoke into the air. This smoke would signal the main group of soldiers to attack. Then the main group of Israelite men retreated for a short distance, because they trusted that the other Israelite men who had been hiding on the other side of Gibeah would attack the people of the tribe of Benjamin by surprise. So after the main group of Israelite men retreated a little distance, the men who had been hiding rushed out and ran into Gibeah and used their swords to kill everyone in the city. Then they started to burn the buildings.

\v 36 So the people of Benjamin saw that they were defeated; the men of Israel had given ground to Benjamin, because they were counting on the men whom they had placed in ambush against Gibeah.
\v 37 Then the men in ambush hurried and rushed into Gibeah; they hurried in and struck down all the cityâ€™s inhabitants with the edge of the sword.
\v 38 Now the arranged signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush had been that they should make a large column of smoke rise up out of the city.
