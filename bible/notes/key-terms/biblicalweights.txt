There are different ways units of measure can be translated:

  - Use a term similar in spelling to the Bible term for that measure, followed by the equivalent value using a unit of measure that is known to the receptor culture.
  - Directly use the equivalent amount in terms of the unit of measure that is known to the receptor culture, without using the Bible name.
