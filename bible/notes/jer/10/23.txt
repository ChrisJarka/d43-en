\v 23 O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that walks to direct his steps.
\v 24 O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.
\v 25 Pour out your wrath upon the nations that know you not, and upon the families that call not on your name; for they have
devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.
