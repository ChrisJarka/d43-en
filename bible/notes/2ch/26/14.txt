\v 14 Uzziah prepared for them—for all the army—shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging.
\v 15 In Jerusalem he built machines that were designed by skillful men to be on the towers and on the battlements to shoot arrows and large stones. His fame spread to distant lands, for he was greatly helped and so he became very powerful.
