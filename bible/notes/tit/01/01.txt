\v 1 Dear Titus,
\p This is Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I work to build up the faith of God’s people. God chose people for himself, and I work to bring to them the true knowledge that leads them to live in a way that pleases God.
\v 2 While I work, I keep inside of me the hope of everlasting life. God is without lies and he promised everlasting life before the world began.
\v 3 Then, at the right time, he made his word plain for all to see and understand through the message that he entrusted to me to preach, in agreement with the command of God our Savior.
