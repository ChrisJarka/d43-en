\v 7 God may discipline you by requiring you to endure difficult things that happen to you. When God disciplines you, he is treating you as a father treats his children. All fathers discipline their children.
\v 8 So if you have not experienced God disciplining you like he disciplines all his children, you are not true children of God. You are like illegitimate children who have no father to correct them.

\v 7 Endure trials as discipline. God deals with you as with sons, for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?  
\v 8 But if you are without discipline, which we are all  to share in, then you are illegitimate children and not his.
