\v 9 So the commanders of hundreds obeyed everything Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each one took his men, those who were to come in to serve on the Sabbath, and those who were to stop serving on that Sabbath; and they came to Jehoiada the priest.
\v 10 Then Jehoiada the priest gave the commanders of hundreds the spears and shields that belonged to King David and that were in the house of Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the commanders of hundreds** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:11:04|11:4]]. The phrase "commander of hundreds" is probably an official title for a military officer. Possible meanings are 1) the word "hundreds" represents the exact amount of soldiers that each of these commanders led. AT: "the commanders of 100 soldiers" or 2) the word translated as "hundreds" does not represent an exact number, but is the name of a military division. AT: "the commanders of military divisions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **Each one** - "Each commander"
  * **were in the house of Yahweh** - "were stored in the temple"
