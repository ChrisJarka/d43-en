===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Oholah acted like a prostitute while she was still my wife. She desired to have sex with those she loved—soldiers from Assyria.
\v 6 Some of them were army officers and commanders. They wore beautiful blue uniforms. They were all handsome young men. Some of them rode horses.
\v 7 She acted like a prostitute toward all the important Assyrian officials, and became unacceptable to me by worshiping all the idols of the men she wanted to have sex with.

\v 5 And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians
her neighbors,
\v 6 who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
\v 7 And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whoever she doted, with all
their idols she defiled herself.
