\v 6 Therefore be you very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that you turn not
aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;
\v 7 that you come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor
cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves to them;
\v 8 but cleave to Jehovah your God, as you have done to this day.
