\p He woke up and thought, "I will do as I did before. I will shake these ropes off myself and be free!" But he did not realize that Yahweh had left him.
\p
\v 21 So the Philistine men seized him and gouged out his eyes. Then they took him to Gaza. There they put him in prison and bound him with bronze chains. They made him \add turn a millstone to\add* grind grain \add every day\add*.

\v 20 And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other
times, and shake myself free. But he knew not that Jehovah was departed from him.
\v 21 And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters
of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.
\v 22 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
