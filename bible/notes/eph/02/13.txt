\v 13 But now because of what Christ Jesus has done, you who previously did not know God have been able to trust in him because Christ gave his blood and his life on the cross to forgive you forever.

\p
\v 14 Christ has brouight peace and unity between Jews and non-Jews by destroying the barrier between us, as if he destroyed a wall of hate that separated our peoples from one another. He did this by giving his life when his body was crucified, which forgives all who believe in him.
\v 15 Jesus abolished the need to obey all the Jewish laws and commandments. He made Jews and non-Jews into one people instead of two by the love he showed when he gave himself for us on the cross. The new people of God are better because we have peace with God and others.
\v 16 Jesus caused Jews and non-Jews to both become friends with God in one new body of believers.Through the cross Jesus ended the hatred by providing friendship with God to everyone who believes.

\v 14 Christ is our peace because he made both Jews and Gentiles one people. He destroyed the wall of hostility that divided us by his body on the cross.
\v 15 Christ abolished the the law of commandments and regulations so that he might create by his forgiveness one new people out of two peoples, one new people who are peaceful.
\v 16 Jesus has reconciled both peoples into one body to God through the cross, as if he put to death the hostility between them.
