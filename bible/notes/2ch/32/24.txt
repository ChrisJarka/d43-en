\v 24 In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death: and he prayed to Jehovah; and he spoke to him, and gave him a sign.
\v 25 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was
wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
\v 26 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that
the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
