\q
\v 1 Praise you Jehovah.
\q Praise you Jehovah from the heavens:
\q Praise him in the heights.
\q
\v 2 Praise you him, all his angels:
\q Praise you him, all his host.
\q
\v 3 Praise you him, sun and moon:
\q Praise him, all you stars of light.
\q
\v 4 Praise him, you heavens of heavens,
\q And you waters that are above the heavens.
\q
\v 5 Let them praise the name of Jehovah;
\q For he commanded, and they were created.
\q
\v 6 He has also established them for ever and ever:
\q He has made a decree which shall not pass away.
\q
\v 7 Praise Jehovah from the earth,
\q You sea-monsters, and all deeps;
\q
\v 8 Fire and hail, snow and vapor;
\q Stormy wind, fulfilling his word;
\q
\v 9 Mountains and all hills;
\q Fruitful trees and all cedars;
\q
\v 10 Beasts and all cattle;
\q Creeping things and flying birds;
\q
\v 11 Kings of the earth and all peoples;
\q Princes and all judges of the earth;
\q
\v 12 Both young men and virgins;
\q Old men and children:
\q
\v 13 Let them praise the name of Jehovah;
\q For his name alone is exalted;
\q His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
\q
\v 14 And he has lifted up the horn of his people,
\q The praise of all his saints;
\q Even of the children of Israel, a people near to him.
\q Praise you Jehovah.
