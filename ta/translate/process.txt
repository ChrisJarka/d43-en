===== The Translation Process =====

There are two things to do in translation:
  - Discover the meaning in the source language text (See: [[en:ta:translate:discover]])
  - Re-tell the meaning in the target language translation (See: [[en:ta:translate:retell]])

Instructions for translation sometimes divide these two things into smaller steps. The graphic below shows how these two fit into the translation process.
