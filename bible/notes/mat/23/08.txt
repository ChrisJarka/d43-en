\v 9 Do not \add honor anyone\add* on earth \add by\add* addressing him as 'Father', because God, your Father in heaven, is the only \add spiritual\add* father of all of you.
\v 10 Do not \add allow people to\add* call you 'Instructors', because I, the Messiah, am the one instructor who\add teaches all of\add* you.

\v 9 Do not honor anyone on earth by addressing him as 'Father,' because God, your Father in heaven, is your only true father.
\v 10 Do not allow people to call you 'teacher,' because I, the Christ, am your only teacher.
