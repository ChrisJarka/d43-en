  * **when the almond tree blossoms **- This refers to the flower of the almond flower that turns from pink to white as it ages, just as men's hair turns white in old age. 
  * **grasshoppers force themselves along **- An old man might limp and walk slowly, thus he walks like a grasshopper. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **natural desires fail **- At the end of life, sexual desire fades away.
  * **Then man goes to his eternal home**  - This refers to death. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
