\c 30
\d A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I will extol thee, O Jehovah; for you have raised me up,
\q And have not made my foes to rejoice over me.
\q
\v 2 O Jehovah my God,
\q I cried to thee, and you have healed me.
\q
\v 3 O Jehovah, you have brought up my soul from Sheol;
\q You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
\q
\v 4 Sing praise to Jehovah, O you saints of his,
\q And give thanks to his holy memorial name.
\q
\v 5 For his anger is but for a moment;
\q His favor is for a life-time:
\q Weeping may wait for the night,
\q But joy comes in the morning.
\q
\v 6 As for me, I said in my prosperity,
\q I shall never be moved.
\q
\v 7 Thou, Jehovah, of your favor had made my mountain to stand strong:
\q You did hide your face; I was troubled.
\q
\v 8 I cried to thee, O Jehovah;
\q And to Jehovah I made supplication:
\q
\v 9 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
\q Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare your truth?
\q
\v 10 Hear, O Jehovah, and have mercy upon me:
\q Jehovah, be you my helper.
\q
\v 11 You have turned for me my mourning into dancing;
\q You have loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
\q
\v 12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent.
\q O Jehovah my God, I will give thanks to you for ever.
