\v 11 The message that you heard when you first  believed in Christ is that we should love each other.
\v 12 We should not hate others as did Adam's son, Cain, who belonged to Satan, the evil one. Because Cain hated his younger brother, he murdered him. I will tell you about why he murdered his brother. It was because Cain habitually conducted his life in an evil way, and he hated his younger brother because his younger brother conducted his life righteously.
