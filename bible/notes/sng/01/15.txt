===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Listen ... listen** - "Listen carefully" or "What I am about to say is important." You could use a word in your language that tells the hearer to listen carefully.
  * **my love** - "you whom I love." Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:09|1:9]]
  * **your eyes are like doves** - The Israelites considered doves to be gentle and soft birds. The man considers the woman's eyes beautiful because the way the woman looks at him makes him think she is gentle. AT: "you are very gentle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
