===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues describing his promises to King David through the prophet Nathan.

  * **It will come about** - "It will happen"
  * **when your days are fulfilled for you to go to your fathers** - The two phrases "when your days are fulfilled" and "go to your fathers" have similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. They both are polite ways to refer to death and dying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **I will raise up your descendant after you** - God appointing David's descendant is spoken of as if Yahweh would raise or lift him up. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will establish his throne forever** - The right to rule as king is described by the place where a king sits. AT: "I will make his rule over Israel to last forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
