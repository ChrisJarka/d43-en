<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, when I came to you, I proclaimed to you the message that God had revealed to me. But I did not proclaim it using eloquent words that would make people think highly of me, nor did I argue in a way that unbelievers would think was very wise.
\v 2 I did that because I decided that I would speak only about Jesus Christ. Specifically, I told you  \add what he accomplished for us when\add* he was killed by being nailed \f + \ft Or:\add when they\add* killed him by nailing him \f* to a cross.

\v 1 And I, brothers, when I came to you, I did not come with excellency of speech or of wisdom. I came to you preaching the testimony of God. 
\v 2 For I determined to know nothing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
