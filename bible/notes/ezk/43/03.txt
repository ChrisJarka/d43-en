\v 3 And it was like the appearance of the vision that I saw—like the appearance of the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city and like the appearance of the vision that I saw at the river Chebar—and I fell to my face!
\v 4 So the Glory of Yahweh came to the house by the way of the gate that opened to the eastern way.
\v 5 And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the inner court, and behold! The Glory of Yahweh filled the house!
