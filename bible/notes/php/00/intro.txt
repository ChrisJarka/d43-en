=== What is the Book of Philippians about? ===

The founding of the Philippian church is recorded in Acts 16. This area of Asia Minor was predominately Gentile (Paul mentions several people with Greek names). Philippi was founded by Philip, who was the father of Alexander the Great. The city was given honor and special privileges of citizenship within the Roman Empire (compare this with Phil. 1:27 and 3:20).
 
The Philippians had sent Epaphroditus, one of their beloved church members, to help Paul in Rome and bring him a gift from the Philippian church. Epaphroditus planned to stay in Rome with Paul and help him while he was in prison (see 1:7, 13, and 16). But Epaphroditus became very ill (2:26 and 4:18).
 
The Philippians had written Paul to ask about how Epaphroditus was doing (2:25), and this letter to the Philippians may have been Paul's reply, telling them about the illness of their friend, his recovery, and his desire to return home to Philippi. This also gave Paul the opportunity to write the Philippian church a letter about matters of importance to the apostle, and to send it to them by means of Epaphroditus, their beloved friend, as he returned home to Philippi.


=== Who wrote the Book of Philippians? ===

Philippians was written by the Apostle Paul from Rome, about AD 61-62.  Most scholars agree that Paul was in prison in Rome when he wrote this letter (see terms specific to Rome as “Praetorium,” 1:13, and “Caesar's household,” 4:22).
