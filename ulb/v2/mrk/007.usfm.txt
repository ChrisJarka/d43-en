\c 7

\v 1 And there are gathered together to him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,
\v 2 and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands.
\v 3 (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the
elders;
\v 4 and when they come from the marketplace, except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things there
are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels.)
\v 5 And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not your disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat
their bread with defiled hands?
\v 6 And he said to them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,
\q This people honoreth me with their lips,
\q But their heart is far from me.
\q
\v 7 But in vain do they worship me,
\q Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.
\m
\v 8 You leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.
\v 9 And he said to them, Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.
\v 10 For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, He that speaks evil of father or mother, let him die the death:
\v 11 but you say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith you might have been profited by me is
Corban, that is to say, Given to God;
\v 12 you no longer suffer him to do anything for his father or his mother;
\v 13 making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have delivered: and many such like things you do.
\v 14 And he called to him the multitude again, and said to them, Hear me all of you, and understand:
\v 15 there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man
are those that defile the man.
\v 16 \f + Many ancient authorities insert v. 16. \fqa If any man has ears to hear, let him
hear.\f*
\v 17 And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.
\v 18 And he says to them, Are you so without understanding also? Perceive you not, that whatever from without goes into
the man, it cannot defile him;
\v 19 because it goes not into his heart, but into his belly, and goes out into the draught?
This he said, making all meats clean.
\v 20 And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defiles the man.
\v 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,
\v 22 covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:
\v 23 all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.
\p
\v 24 And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have
no man know it; and he could not be hid.
\v 25 But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his
feet.
\v 26 Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she implored him that he would cast forth the demon out of her
daughter.
\v 27 And he said to her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to
the dogs.
\v 28 But she answered and says to him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
\v 29 And he said to her, For this saying go your way; the demon is gone out of your daughter.
\v 30 And she went away to her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.
\p
\v 31 And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the
borders of Decapolis.
\v 32 And they bring to him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon
him.
\v 33 And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his
tongue;
\v 34 and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
\v 35 And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain.
\v 36 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they
published it.
\v 37 And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He has done all things well; he makes even the deaf to hear, and the
dumb to speak.
