=== What is the Book of 2 Thessalonians about? ===

This letter was probably written because of new information about events affecting the church in Thessalonica since Paul's first letter. It implies that there was a false letter written in the name of Paul, received by the church in Thessalonica, and that its false teaching led to some confusion. 
 
There are several major issues addressed in 2 Thessalonians. The first matter is the confusion that arose about the second coming of Jesus Christ. The second matter Paul addresses is the issue of idleness. Thirdly, Paul also encourages Christians who are suffering from persecution.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Thessalonians” or "Second Thessalonians." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul's Second Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The Second Letter to the Christians in Thessalonica.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is the "second coming" of Jesus? ===

The Book of 2 Thessalonians focuses on Jesus' eventual return to Earth. At this time, mankind will be judged, Christ's kingdom will begin, and peace will reign. This letter also explains that the [[:en:obe:kt:antichrist|antichrist]], the most powerful enemy of Christ, will appear before the return of Christ.

=== What are eternal rewards and punishment? ===

Those who do not believe in Jesus will suffer eternal punishment after they die. Christians are [[:en:obe:kt:save|saved]] from this punishment, but they will be [[:en:obe:kt:reward|rewarded]] based on the [[:en:obe:kt:faithful|faithfulness]] of the life they live as Christians.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Thessalonians? ===

  * "and the man of lawlessness is revealed" (2:3). The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. Some older versions have, "and the man of sin is revealed."
  * "because God chose you as the first fruits for salvation" (2:13)

  * Some manuscripts say "first fruits" (ULB) while others say "first people" or "from the beginning" (2:13)

Translators are advised to translate this passage following the ULB. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region using other words, it is not wrong to translate them using these other terms.
