\c 28
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 To thee, O Jehovah, will I call:
\q My rock, be not you deaf to me;
\q Lest, if you be silent to me,
\q I become like them that go down into the pit.
\q
\v 2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry to thee,
\q When I lift up my hands toward your holy oracle.
\q
\v 3 Draw me not away with the wicked,
\q And with the workers of iniquity;
\q That speak peace with their neighbors,
\q But mischief is in their hearts.
\q
\v 4 Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings:
\q Give them after the operation of their hands;
\q Render to them their desert.
\q
\v 5 Because they regard not the works of Jehovah,
\q Nor the operation of his hands,
\q He will break them down and not build them up.
\b
\q
\v 6 Blessed be Jehovah,
\q Because he has heard the voice of my supplications.
\q
\v 7 Jehovah is my strength and my shield;
\q My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped:
\q Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
\q And with my song will I praise him.
\q
\v 8 Jehovah is their strength,
\q And he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.
\q
\v 9 Save your people, and bless your inheritance:
\q Be their shepherd also, and bear them up for ever.
