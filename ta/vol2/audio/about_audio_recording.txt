===== About Audio Recording =====

This module answers the question: //What is some background context about recording and the relevance of this manual?//\\
===  ===

Having nearly a 140 year history, audio recording is far from being a new invention and field of expertise. Over the many years of development and experimentation, certain things have been discovered that have come to be considered “principles” of sound, which relate much to the physics of sound. As principles were learned, inventors have steadily created technology designed to capture and reproduce in varying degrees of fidelity and character as compared to the live sound source. 

As scientific and technical as the principles and equipment are, real audio recording is not something that happens in the laboratory conditions of science experiments or the equipment design room. Instead, it happens in a dynamic, diverse real-world environment with each scenario a unique condition, each recording a human-created expression. 

Real audio recording cannot be reduced to a technical or mechanical process. In truth, real audio recording is the craft of a creative artist applying wisdom, skills, proven principles, careful technique, to the unique ingredients of the environment, available tools and characteristics of the people participating.

unfoldingWord Audio Engineering understands this distinction and seeks to encourage and empower the global Church's new and existing audio recordists to become ever wiser and better skilled at their craft. While we hopefully already have some things of value to aid recordists in their endeavors, we are equally students in learning and look forward to what we can continue learning from the global Church and pass along to everyone in a free and open context.
