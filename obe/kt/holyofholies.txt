  * The high priest was the only person allowed into the Most Holy Place. He was permitted to enter it one time every year, on the day of atonement.
  * On the day of atonement, the high priest would offer incense on the altar and sprinkle with blood the cover of the ark of the covenant.
  * The "Most Holy Place" represents the inner access to the presence of God where Jesus' own blood is the only acceptable sacrifice for sin.
