\v 14 Do everything \add God or your leaders ask you to do\add*. Never complain about what they want you to do or argue with them.
\v 15 Behave like that in order that you may be completely faultless \f + \ft doublet \f* and may be perfect children of God \f + \ft doublet \f* while you live in the midst of people who are wicked and do very wicked things \f + \ft doublet \f*. As you live among them, show them clearly \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add the way they ought to behave\add*, just like the sun, moon, and stars \add show an earthly road clearly to us\add* \f + \ft simile \f*.
\v 16 Tell them the message about how \add to\add* have eternal life. I \add ask that you do that\add* in order that on the day Christ \add returns\add* I may be able to rejoice \f + \ft metonymy \f*, that I did not labor \f + \ft doublet \f* so hard among you in vain.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Do everything without complaining or arguing,
\v 15 so that you do or think nothing wrong as you live among unbelievers--for many of these are wicked people who call evil good. Among these wicked people you should be like the stars at night that shine in the midst of darkness.
\v 16 Offer them the message that can make them live forever. If you do this, I will rejoice at the time when Christ returns, because then I will know that did not work among you uselessly.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Do everything without complaining and arguing,
\v 15 so that you may become blameless and harmless children of God without blemish, and shine as lights in the world in the middle of a crooked and depraved generation. 
\v 16 Hold forth the word of life so that I may have reason to glory in the day of Christ, because then I will know that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.
