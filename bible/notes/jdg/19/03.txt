\v 3 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and
a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet
him.
\v 4 And his father-in-law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and
lodged there.
