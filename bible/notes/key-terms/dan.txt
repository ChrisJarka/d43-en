====== Dan ======

===== Facts: =====

Dan was the fifth son of Jacob, born of Bilhah, Rachel's servant, and was one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Dan was the name of the region settled by the tribe of Dan in the northern part of Canaan upon entry into the promised land. The city of Dan was located west of Jerusalem, and existed in the time of Abram.

  * The city of Dan in the location west of Jerusalem probably did not exist during the time the nation of Israel entered the promised land, but had moved to a location about 60 miles north of Jerusalem.
