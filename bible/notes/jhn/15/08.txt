===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **that you be my disciples** - "show you are my disciples" or "demonstrate you are my disciples"
  * **remain in my love** - "continue to be aware of how much I love you"
  * **As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you** - Jesus passes the love of God the Father for him to those who trust in God the Son. The love of God for those who believe in Jesus is illustrated by God in the Scriptures through the words "Father" and "Son." Those words must be maintained in translation to accurately express what God has revealed about the great love God's persons have for each other.
