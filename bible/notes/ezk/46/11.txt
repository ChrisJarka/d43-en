\v 11 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the grain offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and
for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
\v 12 And when the prince shall prepare a free will offering, a burnt offering or peace-offerings as a free will offering to
Jehovah, one shall open for him the gate that looks toward the east; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his
peace-offerings, as he does on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.
