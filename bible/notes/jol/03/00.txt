====== Joel 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The third chapter is the last chapter and continues to use poetic form to communicate the message. You will notice a change in focus in this chapter from the people of Israel to her enemies. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

This chapter contains a variety of figures of speech. But since it is written in poetic form figures of speech will not be uncommon. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

All of the text in the Book of Joel is poetry, as is represented in the ULB. The UDB, however, presents the text as prose, because many translators will choose to use prose in their versions. Translators who wish to translate the book as poetry should read [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]].
