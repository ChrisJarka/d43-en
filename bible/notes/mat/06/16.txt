\v 16 "When you abstain from eating food \add in order to please God\add*, do not look sad as the hypocrites look. They make their faces appear sad in order that people will see that they are abstaining from food \add and will think highly of them\add*. Keep this in mind: \add People will think highly of those people for that\add*, but\add that is the only\add* reward those people will get!
\v 17 Instead, \add each of\add* you, when you abstain from food, should comb your hair and wash your face \add as usual\add*,
\v 18 in order that other people will not notice that you are fasting\add because you will look as you always do\add*. But \add God\add*, your Father, whom no one can see, \add will observe that you are abstaining from food. God\add* your Father sees \add you\add* even though no one else sees \add you\add*, and he will reward you."

\v 16 Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may be
seen of men to fast. Verily I say to you, They have received their reward.
\v 17 But you, when you fastest, anoint your head, and wash your face;
\v 18 that you be not seen of men to fast, but of your Father who is in secret: and your Father, who sees in secret, shall
recompense thee.
