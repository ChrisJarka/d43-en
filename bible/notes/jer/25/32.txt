\q 'See, disaster is going out from nation to nation,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh of hosts says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **See** - "Look" or "Listen." This word adds emphasis to what is said next. AT: "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"
  * **disaster is going out from nation to nation** - Yahweh speaks of great disasters happening in each nation as if "disaster" were a person who goes from nation to nation. AT: "great disasters are going to happen in one nation after another" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **a great storm is beginning from the farthest parts of the earth** - Possible meanings for this metaphor are 1) Yahweh speaks of Babylonian army and the destruction that it will cause as if it were a great storm or 2) Yahweh speaks of his great anger as if it were a great storm that causes much destruction. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those killed by Yahweh** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "those whom Yahweh killed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **will on that day extend from one end of the earth to the other** - By mentioning both ends of the earth, this phrase represents everywhere in between those ends. AT: "will on that day cover the entire earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **they will not be mourned, gathered, or buried** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one will mourn them, gather them, or bury them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **They will be like dung on the ground** - The bodies are compared to dung on the ground to emphasize that they will be disgusting and that no one will bury them. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:16:01|16:4]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
