===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking about what will happen to Edom.

  * **See** - "Look" or "Listen"
  * **he will go up like a lion from the forests of the Jordan to the green pasturelands** - This simile means that when Yahweh punishes the people of Edom, it will be fierce and unexpected like when a lion attacks sheep. This can be stated in first person. AT: "When I punish the people of Edom, it will be fierce and unexpected like when a lion comes out of forest and attacks sheep in the pasture" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **pasturelands** - This is land covered with grass where animals feed on the grass.
  * **Edom run from it** - Here "Edom" represents the people. "It" refers to the land. AT: "the people of Edom will run from their land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **who will be chosen** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "whom I will choose" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For who is like me, and who will summon me?** - Yahweh uses the question to emphasize that no one is like him. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "For no one is like me, no one can summon me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **who will summon me** - "who will challenge me" or "who will call me to account"
  * **What shepherd is able to resist me?** - Yahweh uses the question to show no one can defeat him. Here "shepherd" is a metaphor for "king" or "ruler." This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "No king is able to resist me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
