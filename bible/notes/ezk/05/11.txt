\v 12 One-third of your people will die inside the city because of the plagues they will experience, or by famine\f + \ft Or: lack of food \f*. One-third of your people will be killed by \add your enemies' \add* swords outside the city.

\v 11 Wherefore, as I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable
things, and with all your abominations, therefore will I also diminish
thee; neither shall mine eye spare, and I also will have no pity.
\v 12 A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of you; and a
third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a
sword after them.
