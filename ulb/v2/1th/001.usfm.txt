\c 1
\p
\v 1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace
to you and peace.
\b
\p
\v 2 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you
in our prayers;
\v 3 remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our
God and Father;
\v 4 knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election,
\v 5 how that our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and
in much assurance; even as you know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake.
\v 6 And you became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit;
\v 7 so that you became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
\v 8 For from you has sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to
God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything.
\v 9 For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had to you; and how you turned to God from
idols, to serve a living and true God,
\v 10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,
even Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.
