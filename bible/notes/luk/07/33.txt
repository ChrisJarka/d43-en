\v 33 Similarly, you people are dissatisfied with both John the Baptizer and me! When John came and preached to you, he did not eat ordinary food  or drink wine, like most people do. But you rejected him, saying, 'A demon is controlling him!'
\v 34 Incontrast, I, the one who came from heaven, eat the same food and drink wine as others do. But you reject me, saying, 'Look! This man eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax collectors and other sinners!'
\v 35 But those who are truly God's children  realize that what John and I do is truly wise."

\v 33 For John the Baptist is come* not eating bread nor drinking wine; and you say, He has a demon.
\v 34 The Son of man is come* eating and drinking; and you say, "Behold, a glutton-man , and a winedrinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!"
\v 35 But wisdom is justified from all of her children.
