===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This verse is almost identical to [[:en:bible:notes:jer:49:19|49:14]]. See how you translated that verse. 

  * **Behold!** - The word "Behold" here tells the reader to pay attention to what follows. AT: "Pay attention!"
  * **He goes up like a lion from the heights of the Jordan to the enduring grazing place** - This simile means that when Yahweh punishes the people of Babylon, it will be fierce and unexpected like when a lion attacks sheep. This can be stated in the first person. AT: "When I punish the people of Babylon, it will be fierce and unexpected like when a lion comes out of mountains and attacks sheep in the pasture" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **like a lion** - This is another way of saying that the attack will be fierce and unexpected. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **the enduring grazing place** - This is land covered with grass where animals feed on the grass.
  * **I will quickly cause them to run from it** - Here "them" refers to the Babylonian people; the word "it" refers to the invasion.
  * **who will be chosen** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "whom I will choose" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For who is like me, and who will summon me?** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that no one is like him. AT: "For no one is like me, no one can summon me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **who will summon me** - "who will challenge me" or "who will call me to account"
  * **What shepherd is able to resist me?** - Yahweh uses this question to show no one can defeat him. Here "shepherd" is a metaphor for "king" or "ruler." AT: "No king is able to resist me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
