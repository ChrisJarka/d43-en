===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You who live** - The man is speaking to the woman, so "you" and "live" are feminine singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **listening for your voice** - The voice is a metonym for what the person says. If your language has a word for thinking only of what one is listening for, you could use it here. AT: "waiting to hear you start speaking" or "waiting to hear what you have to say." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **let me hear it** - "let me hear your voice."
