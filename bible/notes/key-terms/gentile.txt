====== Gentile ======


===== Facts: =====


A Gentile is a person who is not a descendant of Jacob or of his twelve sons. Gentiles, then, are people who are not Jews.


    * In Scripture, Gentiles are occasionally referred to as the "uncircumcised" because many of them did not circumcise their male children as the Israelites did.
    * Because God chose the Jews to be his special people, they thought of the Gentiles as outsiders.
    * The Jews were also called Israelites or Hebrews at different times in history. Everyone else was called a Gentile.
    * Gentile could also be translated as "not an Israelite", "not a Jew" or "a person from another nation."
    * Traditionally Jews would not eat with Gentiles.
