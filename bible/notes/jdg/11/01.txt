\v 1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead became the father of Jephthah.
\v 2 And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said to him, You shall
not inherit in our father’s house; for you are the son of another woman.
\v 3 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and lived in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and
they went out with him.
