\v 40 And the King shall answer and say to them, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it to one of these my brethren,
even these least, you did it to me.
\v 41 Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for
the devil and his angels:
\v 42 for I was hungry, and you did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
\v 43 I was a stranger, and you took me not in; naked, and you clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and you visited me not.
