\v 20 \add My\add* Father loves me, and he shows me everything that he is doing. He will show me \add the miracles\add* that \add he wants me to do\add* that will be greater than the ones that \add you have already seen me do\add*, so that you may be amazed.

\v 19 Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what
he sees the Father doing: for what things soever he does, these the Son also does in like manner.
\v 20 For the Father loves the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show
him, that you may marvel.
