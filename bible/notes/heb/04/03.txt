====== Hebrews 04:3-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 We who have believed\add in Christ\add* are able to enter the place of resting \add eternally. We know there is a place where we will rest eternally\add* because God said,
\q Because I was angry with them, I solemnly declared, "They will not enter \add the land where\add* I would let them rest."
\p \add God said that\add* even though he ceased his work\add of creating things\add* after he created the world.
\v 4 What someone wrote somewhere \add in the Scriptures\add* about the seventh day\add after he had spent six days creating the world\add*, supports that,
\q Then, on the seventh day, God rested from his work \add of creating everything\add*.
\p
\v 5 But note again what God said about the Israelites\add in the\add* passage that I quoted previously,
\q They will not enter\add the land where\add* I would let them rest.

\v 3 For we who have believed do enter into that rest; even as he has said,
\q As I sware in my wrath,
\q They shall not enter into my rest:
\p although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
\v 4 For he has said somewhere of the seventh day on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works;
\v 5 and in this place again,
\q They shall not enter into my rest.
