====== holy, holiness ======

===== Definition: =====

To be holy is to be separated from all sin and evil. Only God is absolutely holy. But he can make things and people holy. The state of being holy is "holiness".

  * A holy person or thing is morally perfect, completely without sin.
  * People and things that God sets apart for a special purpose are called holy, such as a priest who must be ceremonially cleansed of sin in order to serve God, or a place where God reveals himself, such as, "holy ground" or his temple.
  * To "make holy" is often translated as "sanctify" in English.
  * Ways to translate "holy" might include, "set apart" or "pure" or "perfectly sinless".
