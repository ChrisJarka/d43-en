How To Do an Important Term Check

  - Make a list of the Important Terms in the story or Bible passage that you translate, along with the term that you choose for it in the target language.
  - Each time the Important Term occurs in the source text, make sure that the word you have chosen for the translation still makes sense in that context. If it does not, discuss the problem with others on the translation team and try to find a solution together. You may need to use a different term, or you may need to use more than one term for the different contexts, or you may need to find another way to communicate the Important Term, such as using a longer phrase.
