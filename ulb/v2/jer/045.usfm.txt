\v 1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth
of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
\v 2 Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, to thee, O Baruch:
\v 3 You did say, Woe is me now! for Jehovah has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.
\v 4 Thus shall you say to him, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have
planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land.
\v 5 And seek you great things for thyself? seek them not; for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, says Jehovah;
but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places whither you goest.
