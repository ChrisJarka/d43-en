\v 21 That water, by means of which eight people were saved when God punished the other people , represents  the water in which we are baptized  to show that God has saved us  from God punishing us. The water in which we are baptized does not remove dirt from our bodies. Instead, it shows that we are requesting  God to assure us that he has removed our guilt  for having sinned. And because Jesus Christ became alive again after he died, we know that God accepted his sacrifice for us and because of that was able to remove our guilt.
\v 22 Christ has gone into heaven and is ruling in the place of highest honor next to God, after God caused all the evil and powerful spirit beings to be made subject to him.

\v 21 This is like baptism that saves you now, not washing away filth from the flesh, but the presentation of a good conscience to God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
\v 22 He is at the right hand of God. He went into heaven. Angels, authorities, and powers must submit to him.
