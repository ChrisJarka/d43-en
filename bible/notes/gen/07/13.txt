===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Domestic Animal**  - Animals kept as livestock i.e. cows, sheep, goats, etc…
  * **…their own kind - **  alternate terms: animals of the same species; "like" animals that could naturally form breeding pairs; the pairs of animals that God brought to the ark.
  * **Shem, Ham, Japheth**
 - Noah's 3 sons are not listed in order of birth (from other verses we know the birth order to be Japheth, Shem, Ham) but in order of importance, as the Israelites were descendants of Shem. This is what it means, here. Sequence may be important or mean other things in your native language or customs.
  * **on that very day - **  this is one of a string of phrases that <font 14px line-height: 19px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>introduce</font>    <font 14px line-height: 19px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>information</font>    <font 14px line-height: 19px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>about</font>    <font 14px line-height: 19px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>what</font>    <font 14px line-height: 19px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>happened on</font>    <font 14px line-height: 19px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>the day that God's promise was</font>    <font 14px line-height: 19px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>fulfilled. Each phrase</font>    builds in intensity (v. 10 "after the seven days"; v. 11 "on that day"; v. 13 "on that very day") It would be a benefit to find native language phrases that also keep building.
