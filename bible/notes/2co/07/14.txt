===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I had told Titus that I was pleased about you. And I did not need to be ashamed \add for having boasted about you like that, because you did what I knew that you would do\add*. Just like everything that I have taught you \add and written to you\add* has been the truth, just as the good things that I told Titus about you were also true.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I told him all about you, and I am proud of you and I boasted to him about you, and you did not put me to shame when he came to you. We boasted about you so much to Titus, and you proved it was all true!
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
In addition to our own comfort, we also rejoiced even more because of the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by all of you.
\v 14 For if I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame. But just as everything we said to you was true, our boasting about you to Titus proved to be true.
</usfm>
