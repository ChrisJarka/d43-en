=== What is the Book of 2 Thessalonians about? ===

This letter was probably written because of new information about events affecting the church in Thessalonica since Paul's first letter. The book implies that there was a false letter written in the name of Paul, received by the church in Thessalonica, and that its false teaching led to some confusion. 
 
There are several major issues addressed in 2 Thessalonians. The first matter is the confusion that arose about the second coming of Jesus Christ. The second matter Paul addresses is the issue of idleness. Paul also encourages Christians who are suffering from persecution.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Thessalonians” or "Second Thessalonians." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul's Second Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The Second Letter to the Christians in Thessalonica.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is the "second coming" of Jesus? ===

The Book of 2 Thessalonians focuses on Jesus' eventual return to Earth. This is talked about as a return or another coming of Christ. At this time, mankind will be judged, Christ's kingdom will begin, and peace will reign. This book also explains that the [[:en:obe:kt:antichrist|antichrist]], the most powerful enemy of Christ, must appear before the return of Christ.

=== What is church discipline? ===

The early church was frequently faced with a question: what to do about Christians who live [[:en:obe:kt:ungodly|ungodly]] lives? This harms their testimony and brings shame to Christ. Paul response involves something known as "church discipline." The church is to challenge and encourage those who are struggling with [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] in a certain way. Failure to do so will result in an unhealthy church. There are several passages in the New Testament that deal with this topic.

=== What are eternal rewards and punishment? ===

Those who do not believe in Jesus, will suffer eternal punishment after they die. Christians are [[:en:obe:kt:save|saved]] from this punishment but they will be [[:en:obe:kt:reward|rewarded]] based on the [[:en:obe:kt:faithful|faithfulness]] of the life they live as Christians. It is possible for Christians to lose out on possible rewards. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the meaning of the phrase "gathering together" with Christ? ===

Paul uses this phrase in reference to the second coming of the Lord (2:1). Because of this many people believe that there will be a time when Christ comes to remove the church from the world. This event has been called the rapture. Not all Christians believe that this is what Paul is describing and further research may be necessary to determine how best to translate this phrase.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Thessalonians? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of manuscripts that many believe are more accurate. The follow are the most significant issues in the Book of 2 Thessalonians:

  * Some manuscripts say "lawlessness" (ULB) while others say "sin very greatly" (UDB) (2:7) 
  * Some manuscripts say "first fruits" (ULB) while others say "first people" or "from the beginning" (2:13)

Translators are advised to translate this passage following the ULB. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region using other words, it is not wrong to translate them using these other terms.
