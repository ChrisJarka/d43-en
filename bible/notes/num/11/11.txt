\v 11 Moses said to Yahweh, "Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why are you not pleased with me? You make me carry the load of all these people.
\v 12 Did I conceive all these people? Have I given them birth so that you should say to me, 'Carry them closely to your chest as a father carries a baby?' Should I carry them to the land that you swore to their ancestors to give them?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses complains to Yahweh using several rhetorical questions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

  * **Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why are you not pleased with me?** - "What have I done wrong that you treat me, your servant, so badly like this?" Moses used questions to complain about the way God was treating him. They can be expressed as a statement. AT: "I have done nothing wrong to deserve this." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **carry the load of all these people** - Moses is complaining that it is too difficult to be responsible for all these people as if they were a heavy load to carry. AT "You make me responsible for all these people, but it's too hard for me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Did I conceive all these people? Have I given them birth so that you should say to me** - These are rhetorical questions that can be expressed as one statement. AT: "I am not the father of all these people. So it is not fair that you should say to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Carry them closely to your chest as a father carries a baby** - This means that Moses is to be responsible for the people who cannot take care of themselves, like a parent must care for an infant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Should I carry them ... to give them?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am not able to carry them ... to give them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
