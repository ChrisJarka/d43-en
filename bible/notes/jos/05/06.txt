\v 6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war that came forth
out of Egypt, were consumed, because they listened not to the voice of Jehovah: to whom Jehovah sware that he would not
let them see the land which Jehovah sware to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 7 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them did Joshua circumcise: for they were uncircumcised, because
they had not circumcised them by the way.
