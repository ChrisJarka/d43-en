\v 4 I, John, am writing to the seven groups of believers  in the province of Asia. May God, who has always existed, who exists, and who will exist, and may the seven spirits who are before him sitting on this throne--may all these act kindly toward you and give you peace.
\v 5 Also may Jesus Christ, who has faithfully explained and shown God to us, act kindly toward you and give you peace. For he is the first one whom God raised from the dead, and he is the one who rules the kings of the earth. He is the one who loves us and who freed us from the guilt of our sins by his blood when he died.
\v 6 He is the one who has caused us to accept God to rulel over us. He has made us people to worship God, his Father. May everyone praise him forever. And so it will be!

\v 4 John to the seven churches, the ones in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him who is and who was and who is to come, from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;
\v 5 and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and released us from our sins by his blood,
\v 6 and who made us a kingdom, priests to God and his Father. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.
