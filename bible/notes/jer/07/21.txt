\v 23 What I told them was, 'Obey me;
\q2 if you do that, I will be your God and you will be my people.

\v 21 Thus says Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat their flesh.
\v 22 For I did not declare to your fathers and did not command them in the day when I brought them out from the land of Egypt concerning matters of burnt offering and sacrifice.
\v 23 For this is the word I commanded them, when I said, ‘Listen to my voice and I will be your God and you will be my people. So walk in all the way that I am commanding you so that it may be well for you.’
