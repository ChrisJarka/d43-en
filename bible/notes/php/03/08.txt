\v 8 More than that, I consider all things to be worthless, compared to how great it is to know Christ Jesus my Lord. Because I \add want to know\add* him \add better\add* \f + \ft Or: In order that I \add may know\add* him \add better\add* \f*, I have rejected all things as worthless. I consider them \add as useless as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* rubbish, in order that I may have \add a close relationship with\add* Christ \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\v 9 and in order that I may completely belong to him. It was not as a result of \add my obeying\add* the laws \add he gave Moses\add* that God erased the record of my sins. Instead, it is because I have trusted in Christ \add that God\add* has declared the guilt for my sins to be ended and he enables me to act righteously. \add It is\add* God \add himself who\add* has erased the record of my sins, and he enables me to act righteously, \add only\add* because I have trusted \add in Christ\add*.
\v 10 I \add want\add* to know Christ \add better and better\add*. Particularly, I \add want\add* to continually experience \add his working\add* powerfully in me\f + \ft Or: my life \f*, \add just like God worked powerfully when he\add* caused Christ to become alive after he died. I \add also want to be continually willing\add* to suffer \add in order that I may obey God\add*, just like Christ suffered \add in order that he might obey God. I also want\add* to be completely willing to die for \add Christ\add*, even as he died for me,
\v 11 \add because I expect that, as a result of God's goodness\add*, he will cause me to live again after I have died.

\v 8 Instead, even more I now consider all things as not only worthless, but as useless garbage to throw away, compared to how great it is to know Christ Jesus my Lord. If I remove from my life what is worthless, that will help me focus on Christ.
\v 9 I want to belong completely to Christ, without trusting any righteousness of my own by keeping the Law. Instead I trust totally in Christ, and God then declares me good in His sight, because I simply rely on Christ to save me from sin.
\v 10 I want to know Christ better and better and experience him powerfully working in me, just like God worked powerfully when he caused Christ to become alive after he died. I also want to be willing to suffer to help me obey God, just like Christ suffered for us and obeyed God throughout his crucifixion. I also want to be completely willing to die for Christ, even as he died for me,
\v 11 because I fully expect that God will cause me to live again after I have died, as he has promised.

\v 8 In fact, now I count all things to be loss because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have discarded all things and I consider them garbage so that I may gain Christ.
\v 9 I now belong to him, but I do not have a righteousness of my own from the law. Rather, instead I have the righteousness from God which is through faith in Christ.
\v 10 Now I know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, and I am transformed by Christ in the likeness of his death,
\v 11 so somehow I may experience the resurrection from the dead.
