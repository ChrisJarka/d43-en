\v 18 For you are not come to a mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
\v 19 and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken to them;
\v 20 for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;
\v 21 and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:
