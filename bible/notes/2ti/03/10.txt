\v 10 Timothy, you followed my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, endurance, love, perseverance,
\v 11 persecutions, and the sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium and in Lystra.  I carried the weight of all these persecutions, yet the Lord rescued me from each one of them.
\v 12 All those who want to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
\v 13 Evil men and impostors will continue to become more evil. They lead people astray and they themselves are led astray.
