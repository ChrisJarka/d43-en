\v 22 And now, look, I go bound in the Holy Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there,
\v 23 except that the Holy Spirit witnesses to me in every city and says that chains and sufferings await me. 
\v 24 But I do not consider that my life is in any way precious to myself, so that I may finish my race and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to bear witness to the gospel of the grace of God.
