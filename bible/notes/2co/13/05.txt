\v 5 Each of you must search your own life, and look for evidence that you trust in God's love and mercy. You must put yourself to this test: Do you see that Jesus Christ lives within you? He lives in every one who trusts in him, unless you fail this test.
\v 6 But my hope for you is that when you take this test you will find that Christ lives in you, and that you have not failed the test.
