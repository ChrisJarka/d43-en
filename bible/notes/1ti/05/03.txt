====== 1 Timothy 05:3-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 \add Make sure that the congregation\add* respects widows who have no one to care for them. \add They should respect them by taking care of them\add*.
\v 4 If a widow has children or grandchildren, these \add children or grandchildren\add* should learn that they are to respect their own family first. By doing that they can repay their parents and grandparents for all that they did for them when they were young, because doing that pleases God.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Respect the widows if they are true widows.
\v 4 But if a widow has a child or grandchildren, these should honor their mother at home and pay her back for everything she has done for them. If they do this, they will please God.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Honor widows, the real widows; 
\v 4 but if a widow has a child or grandchildren, let them first learn to show honor in their own household and repay their parents, because this is pleasing to God.
