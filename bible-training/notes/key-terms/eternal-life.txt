===== Definition: =====


"Eternal" refers to something that never ends. "Eternal life" is used in the Bible to refer to living forever with God.


    * When a person repents of his sin and trusts Jesus to forgive him, that person receives "eternal life." Nothing will ever separate that person from Godâ€“not even death. He will enjoy life in God's presence forever.
    * In the Bible, to receive "eternal life" is to be "saved" from sin and death.
    * Sometimes this is translated as, "everlasting life" or, "living forever."
