===== Writing Styles - Connecting Words =====

===== Description =====

Connecting words are words that link parts of a text to one another. These words help to organize what someone is saying or writing to show how their thoughts are related to each other and to the topic. Connecting words help the reader understand the text by showing how the speaker or writer is connecting his thoughts into a coherent message. 
Each language has its own patterns to show how thoughts are related and connected into a clear meaning. Specific words and phrases that join sentences or paragraphs together are important for connecting thoughts together for communicating clearly. 

Some other things that are important for clearly connecting the thoughts and meaning of a message include arranging the time order of the events into a sequence that accurately pictures what the writer desires the reader to understand. Also important for clarity and successfully communicating are things like describing what caused or causes something to happen, and then describing what has happened and the results of what has happened. Using an important word many times in a text helps readers and hearers understand more clearly, and also using words that are similar to the important words or substituting one word for another (like a pronoun for a noun) can help the meaning in a text be clearly understood.  

**Definition**: Connecting words are words that join two or more narratives or paragraphs or verses or sentences or clauses or phrases or words.\\
**Examples**: Examples of connecting words include: now, therefore, and, but, for, so, if, if only, since, then, when, while, whenever, because, yet, unless, like, and many more. In English, the simple joining of sentences is typically done with a conjunction. English also uses transition words or phrases such as: specifically, chiefly, in the beginning, following, in conclusion, to summarize, as a result, moreover.\\
**Purpose**: The purpose of connecting words is to show how a statement or groups of statements  are joined with other statements. How statements are connected clarifies the meaning intended by the writer or speaker by showing how his statements and words are related to each other.

=== Reason this could be a translation issue ===
Accurately understanding connecting words is important because their presence in the text and their meaning and purpose can be misunderstood and mistranslated. The meaning of connecting words is dependent upon the two thoughts that they are connecting. The thoughts that connecting words are connecting may be very long groups of sentences, or very short phrases or even just words, or anything in between. However, the meaning of the connecting words will depend upon the context created by what the writer is saying in the two texts that the connecting words are connecting.



===== Translation Strategies =====

If your language has a word that clearly translates the meaning of a connecting word found in the ULB, then consider translating with that word. These strategies below may help when your language cannot translate a connecting word found in the ULB.\\

1. Translators may need to use a connecting word even if the ULB does not use a connecting word. Use connecting words in your language that are natural and clear to your readers, as needed, even if the ULB does not use a connecting word.\\ 
2. Translators do not need to use a connecting word just because the ULB does. Translators must be careful to use whatever words sound natural and communicates the intended meaning clearly and accurately in their language.\\
3. Translators must understand the meaning of the two thoughts that the writer is connecting with his use of a connecting word. The context created by the writer by the two thoughts he is connecting will be very important to the meaning of the connecting word that connects those thoughts.\\
4. Translators may seek to translate with the same connecting word in your language when the meaning is essentially the same, even if the ULB does not use a connecting word, or even if the ULB uses different connecting words for the same meaning.\\ 
5. Translators may use different connecting words in your language when what is being said can be said in two different ways, but those ways mean the same thing. 




===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Translators may need to use a connecting word even if the ULB does not use a connecting word. Use connecting words in your language that are natural and clear to your readers, as needed, even if the ULB does not use a connecting word.\\ 
//For\\
“all flesh is like grass, __and__ all its glory is like the flower of grass.\\
The grass withers, and the flower falls off,\\
but the word of the Lord remains forever.”\\
This is the message that was proclaimed as the gospel to you.//\\
(I Peter 2:24-25 ULB)\\

In these verses “__**and**__” simply shows that “flesh is like grass” __and__ also “flesh is like the “glory” of a “flower.” In English, the word “__and__” could have even been left out and no connecting word used, like this: “all flesh is like grass, all its glory is like …”

Perhaps in your language the following connecting word may be more clear than “and” in the verses above:\\
For\\
“all flesh is like grass, **__because__** all its glory is like the flower of grass.\\
The grass withers, and the flower falls off,\\
but the word of the Lord remains forever.”\\
This is the message that was proclaimed as the gospel to you.\\
(I Peter 2:24-25 ULB)\\

In these verses, the connecting word “__because__” could be used instead of “and.” “__Because__” indicates that the words that follow will show the reason that “flesh is like grass,” not just “and” flesh is like a flower.\\

“__Because__” means that “all flesh is like grass” __because__ people’s bodies (their “flesh”) die, and then the “glory” of their bodies goes back into the ground, like a “flower” does when it dies.\\

So, if in your language the connecting word “and” here needs to show that the text is giving the reason that “flesh is like grass,” then you may use a word in your language that can mean that a reason is about to be given (like “__because__” does in English).\\

2.  Translators do not need to use a connecting word just because the ULB does. Translators must be careful to use whatever words sound natural and communicates the intended meaning clearly and accurately in their language.
__**For**__\\
“all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of grass.\\
The grass withers, and the flower falls off,\\
but the word of the Lord remains forever.”\\
This is the message that was proclaimed as the gospel to you.\\
(I Peter 2:24-25 ULB)\\

In the verses above, the connecting word “__For__” connects these verses to what has been said previously in this chapter, which is describing the eternal word of God. So, these  verses continue describing how God’s word is eternal, “remaining forever.”\\

However, the connecting word “__For__” may not need to be present in your language. It might be more clear in your language just to leave the word “__For__” out of the translation, especially if it that word is likely to cause confusion in your readers.\\ 

3.  Translators must understand the meaning of the two thoughts that the writer is connecting with his use of a connecting word. The context created by the writer by the two thoughts he is connecting will be very important to the meaning of the connecting word that connects those thoughts.\\
For
“all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of grass.
The grass withers, and the flower falls off,
but the word of the Lord remains forever.”
This is the message that was proclaimed as the gospel to you.
(I Peter 2:24-25 ULB)
The connecting word “but” in these verses is connecting Peter’s description of the human body and flowers, which all die, with God’s word, which will never die. So, “but” is showing that there is a very strong difference between human bodies and flowers, and God’s word. “But” is strongly contrasting God’s word that lives forever with the lives of people and plants, which die. 

So a connecting word in your language that indicates a strong contrast needs to be used here to show that the two thoughts being connected by this connecting word are very different from one another—opposites from each other.

4.	Translators may seek to translate with the same connecting word in your language when the meaning is essentially the same, even if the ULB does not use a connecting word, or even if the ULB uses different connecting words for the same meaning.

Readers of your translation may be helped if you choose connecting words in your language for meanings that the translation will keep standard. For example, if your language has words like the words below that you define and use with standard meanings, meanings that these words will usually have, then the verses above might be translated as noted below.
	Therefore: 	This connecting word means that because of what has just been 
described, a result of that will now be described.
Because: 	This connecting word means that the cause or reason for something is about to be described.
Then:	This connecting word means that the event which follows comes after the event previously mentioned or described.
But:	This connecting word shows a contrast between what has been previously described and what follows.
If these connecting words are used according to the meanings above, then our verses from 1 Peter might translated as follows:
Therefore,
“all flesh is like grass, because all its glory is like the flower of grass.
The grass withers, then the flower falls off,
but the word of the Lord remains forever.”
This is the message that was proclaimed as the gospel to you.
(I Peter 2:24-25 ULB edited for this page)
If connecting words can be defined and used by translators to have the same meaning each time they are used, or at least most of the time they are used, with only a small range of variation of meaning, then that should help readers understand the connecting words of your language in regard to how they are used and what they mean in your translation of the Bible.
5.	Translators may use different connecting words in your language when what is being said can be said in two different ways, but those ways mean the same thing. 

Compare below the different connecting words used by the ULB and an alternate translation. Use whatever connecting words in your language communicate clearly and accurately the meaning of the Biblical text.
For
“all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of grass.
The grass withers, and the flower falls off,
but the word of the Lord remains forever.”
This is the message that was proclaimed as the gospel to you.
(I Peter 2:24-25 ULB)

Therefore “all people will die like grass dies, 
because the life of humans dies exactly like flowers fall to the ground. 
Yet, the Lord’s words live forever!” 
This is the message of good news that we proclaimed to you.
(I Peter 2:24-25)
