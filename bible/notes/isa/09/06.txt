===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given** - Isaiah describes a child who will be born to rule the nation of Judah.  Isaiah refers to this future event as if it has happened in the past to emphasize that the event will certainly happen.  Alternate translation: "For to us a child has been born; to us the Lord has given a son" Notice that the ULB now shifts from "them" (used previously) to "us." (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:doublet]] and [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:active]] and [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:123person]])
  * **the rule will be on his shoulder**  - "The child will rule his people."
  * **his name will be called** - "his name will be" (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:active]])
  * **Mighty God, Everlasting Father** - These phrases suggest he divine nature of the ruler.
  * **to establish it and sustain it with justice and with righteousness** - "He will establish and protect his kingdom and rule fairly and justly."
  * **from this time onward and for evermore** - "now and forever" (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:doublet]]
  * **The Zeal of Yahweh of Hosts will do this** - See how you translated "Yahweh of Hosts" in 1:9.  Alternate translation: "With great passion and might, the Lord will cause all this to happen."
