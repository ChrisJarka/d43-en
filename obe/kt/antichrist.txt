===== Definition: =====

The term "antichrist" refers to a person or teaching that is against Jesus Christ and his work. There are many antichrists in the world.

  * The apostle John wrote that a person (or teaching) is antichrist if he says that Jesus is not the Messiah or if he denies that Jesus is both God and human.
  * John makes it clear that an antichrist is someone who deceives other people.
  * The Bible also teaches that there is a general spirit of antichrist in the world which opposes Jesus' work.
  * The New Testament book of Revelation explains that there will be a man called the "antichrist" who will be revealed at the end of the great tribulation. This man will be empowered by Satan to attempt to destroy the Church and Israel, but he will be defeated by Jesus.
