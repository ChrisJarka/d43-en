\v 1 And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation,
and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
\v 2 And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answering says to him, You sayest.
\v 3 And the chief priests accused him of many things.
\v 4 And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest you nothing? behold how many things they accuse you of.
\v 5 But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marvelled.
\p
\v 6 Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.
\v 7 And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection
had committed murder.
\v 8 And the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do to them.
\v 9 And Pilate answered them, saying, Will you that I release to you the King of the Jews?
\v 10 For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
\v 11 But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
\v 12 And Pilate again answered and said to them, What then shall I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?
\v 13 And they cried out again, Crucify him.
\v 14 And Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.
\v 15 And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him,
to be crucified.
\p
\v 16 And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
\v 17 And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;
\v 18 and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
\v 19 And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
\v 20 And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to
crucify him.
\p
\v 21 And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go
with them, that he might bear his cross.
\p
\v 22 And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
\v 23 And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
\v 24 And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.
\v 25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
\v 26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\v 27 And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.
\v 28 \f + Many ancient authorities insert v. 28. \fqa And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was reckoned with
transgressors.\f*
\v 29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! you that destroy the temple, and buildest
it in three days,
\v 30 save thyself, and come down from the cross.
\v 31 In like manner also the chief priests mocking him among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others;
himself he cannot save.
\v 32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were
crucified with him reproached him.
\p
\v 33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
\v 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God,
my God, why have you forsaken me?
\v 35 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls Elijah.
\v 36 And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see
whether Elijah comes to take him down.
\v 37 And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
\v 38 And the veil of the temple was tore in two from the top to the bottom.
\v 39 And when the centurion, who stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the
Son of God.
\v 40 And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom were
both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
\v 41 who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him; and many other women that came up with him to
Jerusalem.
\p
\v 42 And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
\v 43 there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God;
and he boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
\v 44 And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any
while dead.
\v 45 And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.
\v 46 And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been
hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
\v 47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses [*]saw where he was laid.
