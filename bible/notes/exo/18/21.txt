\v 21 Furthermore, you must choose capable men from all the people, men who fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain. You must place them over people to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
\v 22 They will judge the people in all routine cases, but the difficult cases they will bring to you. As for every small case, they will judge it themselves so that it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.
\v 23 If you do this thing, and if God commands you to do so, then you will be able to endure, and all this people will be able to go home satisfied."
