====== 1 Corinthians 01:22-23 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 The Jews want \add people to prove, by performing\add* miracles, \add that their message is true\add*. The non-Jews want to hear only messages consisting of talk that they consider to be very wise.
\v 23 As for us, we proclaim \add the message about what\add* Christ \add accomplished for us when\add* he was nailed \f + \ft Or:\add when they\add* nailed him \f* to the cross. That message offends Jews \add because they do not think that the Messiah will die, and\add* non-Jews think it is \f + \ft irony \f* a foolish message.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 The Jews wanted public displays of miraculous power before they would follow anyone. The Greeks are slaves to their philosphies and high-sounding speculations.
\v 23 But we proclaim the message--a message in a person: Christ who was crucified. For the Jews it is a cause of stumbling and it is offensive to their law. To the Greeks it is not sophisticated enough for them to believe it, or it seemed to be too simple to be true.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 For the Jews ask for miraculous signs and the Greeks seek wisdom.
\v 23 But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Greeks.
