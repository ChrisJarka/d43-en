\v 1 Jehovah reigneth; let the earth rejoice;
\q Let the multitude of isles be glad.
\q
\v 2 Clouds and darkness are round about him:
\q Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
\q
\v 3 A fire goes before him,
\q And burns up his adversaries round about.
\q
\v 4 His lightnings lightened the world:
\q The earth saw, and trembled.
\q
\v 5 The mountains melted like wax at the presence of Jehovah,
\q At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
\q
\v 6 The heavens declare his righteousness,
\q And all the peoples have seen his glory.
\q
\v 7 Let all them be put to shame that serve graven images,
\q That boast themselves of idols:
\q Worship him, all you gods.
\q
\v 8 Zion heard and was glad,
\q And the daughters of Judah rejoiced,
\q Because of your judgments, O Jehovah.
\q
\v 9 For thou, Jehovah, are most high above all the eareh:
\q You are exalted far above all gods.
\q
\v 10 O you that love Jehovah, hate evil:
\q He preserves the souls of his saints;
\q He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.
\q
\v 11 Light is sown for the righteous,
\q And gladness for the upright in heart.
\q
\v 12 Be glad in Jehovah, you righteous;
\q And give thanks to his holy memorial name.
