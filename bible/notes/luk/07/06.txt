He told them to go to tell Jesus, and tell him this: "Lord, and associate with me. "Lord, do not be troubled by my request since I am not important enough that you should visit/come to my house,
\v 7 this is why I did not come to you myselfI did not feel worthy to come to you, either. But only say the word and my servant will certainly become well againplease command that my servant be healed, and he will become well!
\v 8 I believe this because, as for me, there are people who have authority over me and I obey them. For I understand authority. I am a man who is placed under authority and I also have soldiers under my own authority. When I say to one of them, 'Go!' he goes. When I say to another 'Come!' he comes. When I say to my slave, 'Do this!' he does it. And I believe that you speak with a similar kind of authority."

\v 6 And/So Jesus continued on his way with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to say to him, "Lord, do not trouble yourself, for/because I am not worthy that you should enter/[come in] under my roof.
\v 7 Therefore/[For this reason] I did not even consider myself to be worthy enough to come to you; but just say a word and my servant will be healed.
\v 8 For I too am a man who is placed under authority and I also have soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go'  and he goes, and to another one, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
