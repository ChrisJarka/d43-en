\p
\v 1 And Jehovah sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich,
and the other poor.
\v 2 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds;
\v 3 but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with
him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a
daughter.
