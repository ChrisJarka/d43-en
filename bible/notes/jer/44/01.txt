\v 2 "This is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelites \add say you belong to\add*, say: You saw the disaster that I caused the people in Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah to experience. Those towns are now ruined and deserted.

\v 2 “Thus says Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: You yourselves have seen all the calamity that I brought upon Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah, so look! This day they are a ruin and there is no one inhabiting them!
