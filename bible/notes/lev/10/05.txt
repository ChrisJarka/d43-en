\v 5 So they came near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
\v 6 Then Moses said to Aaron  and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, "Do no let your hair on  your heads hang wildly, and do not tear your clothes, so you will not die, and so Yahweh will not be angry with all the congregation. But let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, mourn the burning which Yahweh has kindled.
\v 7 You must not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, or you will die, for the anointing oil of Yahweh is upon you. So they did according to the word of Moses.
