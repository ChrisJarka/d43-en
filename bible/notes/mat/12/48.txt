===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **said to him who told him **- Jesus is talking about the person in the previous verse who told Jesus his mother and brothers were waiting to see him.
  * **Who is my mother? And who are my brothers**  - This rhetorical question could be translated as "I will tell you who is really like family to me." Jesus was not asking for information. (See: Rhetorical Question.)
  * **whoever**  - "anyone"
  * **does the will of my Father**  - "obeys God"
