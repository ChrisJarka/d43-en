\v 5 In the center of the storm I saw what resembled four living creatures. They resembled humans,
\v 6 but each of them had four faces and four wings.

\p
\v 4 Then I looked, and there was a Spirit in a storm-wind coming from the north--a great cloud with fire flashing within it and a brightness surrounding it and inside of it, and the fire was like amber within the cloud.
\v 5 And within its midst was the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man;
\v 6 but they had four faces each, and each of the creatures had four wings.
