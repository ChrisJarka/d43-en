\v 15 Even Herod does not think he is guilty, because he sent him back to me without punishing him. So it is clear that this man does not deserve to die.
\v 16 So I will tell my soldiers to whip him and then set him free."
\v 17 (Pilate said this because he had to set free one prisoner at the Passover feast).

<usfm>
\v 15 No, nor does Herod, for he sent him back to us, and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
\v 16 I will therefore punish him, and release him."
\v 17 Now he was obligated to release to them one prisoner at the feast.
