====== Double Negatives ======


===== Description =====

This module answers the question: What are double negatives?
 Most languages express the negative near the verb. Some languages can also express negative in a pronoun like “none,” “nothing,” and “no one,” or an adverb like “nowhere.” \\
Examples: In English the following pairs of sentences mean the same thing. “I do not have any” – “I have none”. “I do not want anything” – “I want nothing”.\\
Purpose: The purpose of this page is to help you to understand double negatives in the Bible and to understand how that may differ from the use of double negatives in your language. \\

=== Reason this could be a translation issue ===
Double negatives mean very different things in different languages. In some languages such as Spanish it emphasizes the negative. The following Spanish sentence “No ví a nadie.” has both the word 'no' next to the verb and 'nadie' that means “no one.” It emphasis the negative. In some languages a double negative just means a positive. So "She is not unattractive" means that "She is attractive." In some language the double negative weakens the adjective. So "She is not unattractive" means that "She is a little bit attractive." Some languages such as the languages of the Bible the double negative strengthens the adjective. So "She is not unattractive" means that "She is very attractive." To translate double negatives accurately and clearly in your language, you need to know what a double negative means in the Bible and how you express this same idea in your language.  



===== Examples from English =====
A double negative can also be when a sentence has “not” and a negative prefix like “un” on an adjective, as in the words "unhappy" and "unlikely." Sometimes people use these simply to say that something is not true. For example, “It is not unlikely” may simply mean “It could happen.”
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Titus 3:14** //Our people must learn to engage themselves in good works that meet urgent needs so that they may __not__ be __un__fruitful.//\\ 
\\ 
**"So that they may not be unfruitful"** is a double-negative. It could be stated positively: “so they will be fruitful” or “so they can produce fruit for God” or “so their lives will be useful.”//\\ 
\\ 
**"For you yourselves know, brothers, our visit to you was __not in vain__,"** 1 Thessalonians 2:1
 By using a double negative, Paul emphasized that his visit with them was very worthwhile.//\\ 
\\ 
**All things were made through him. __Without__ him was __not__ anything made that has been made.** John 1:3 (WEB)
 By using a double negative John emphasized that the Son of God created absolutely everything. 
===== Translation Strategies =====
If double negatives are natural and used to strengthen statements in your language consider using them.  Otherwise, you could consider this strategy:
  * Remove the double negative and put in a strengthening word or phrase such as "very". "surly",
