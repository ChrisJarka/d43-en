\v 13 And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every
high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they
offered sweet savor to all their idols.
\v 14 And I will stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah,
throughout all their habitations; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
