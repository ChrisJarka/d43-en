\v 3 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to
destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.
\v 4 And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.
\v 5 And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
