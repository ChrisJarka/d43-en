\v 15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest,
and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;
\v 16 but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke
to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
