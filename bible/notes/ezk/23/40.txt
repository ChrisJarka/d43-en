===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **So surely since you have send out for men who come from far away, to whom messengers had been sent **  - Alternate translation: "Therefore, because you sent messengers carrying messages to men far away"
  * **behold **- This can be translated as "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you."
  * **for whom you **- "for you who"
  * **my incense and my oil**  - This refers to items that would have been used by the priests in the temple (and so they should have been reserved for sacred uses, not to entice the sisters' lovers).
