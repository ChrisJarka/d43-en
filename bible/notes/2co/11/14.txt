\v 14 They are just like Satan who disguises himself as God's messenger, filled with splendor and shining with light.
\v 15 His ministers also disguise themselves, imitating good deeds and acting as though they are righteous. God will deal with them according to what they have done and he will punish them for speaking in God's name, when, all the while, they were lying.
