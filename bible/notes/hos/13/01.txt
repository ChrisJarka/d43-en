\c 13
\p
\v 1 When Ephraim spake, there was trembling; he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.
\v 2 Now they sin more and more. They made cast metal figures from their silver, even idols according to their own understanding, all of them the work of the craftsmen. They say of them, "Those who offer human sacrifices will kiss the calves."
