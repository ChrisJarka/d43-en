===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Your country is desolate** - Possible means are 1) Your land is destroyed" or 2) "There is no one left in the countryside."
  * **your fields–in your presence, strangers are destroying them**- "People who are not from your own country steal the crops in your fields while you watch"
  * **a waste and desolation**  - This could be translated as "the land is destroyed and no one lives there."
  * **as overthrown by strangers** - This compares the destruction in Judah to what a land looks like after an enemy's army has conquered it. This can be translated with an active verb: "like a foreign army has completely conquered it." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:simile]] and [[:en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **The daughter of Zion** - Isaiah refers to Zion or Jerusalem as the daughter of God. This emphasizes that God still loved the people of the city even though he had to punish them for their sins. This could be translated as "Zion" or "the city of Jerusalem" (UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:translate:personification]])
  * **is left as a hut in a vineyard, as a shed in a garden of cucumbers**  - "is like a hut in a vineyard or a shed in a garden of cucumbers." A "hut" and a "shed" are shelters that farmers built in the field during the harvest season.  After the harvest, the farmers left them, and they quickly fell apart. 
  * **as a besieged city** - This could be translated as a new sentence: "Her enemies have surrounded the city."
