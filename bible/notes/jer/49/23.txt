\p
\v 23 Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away: there is sorrow on
the sea; it cannot be quiet.
\v 24 Damascus is waxed feeble, she turns herself to flee, and trembling has seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken
hold of her, as of a woman in travail.
\v 25 How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?
