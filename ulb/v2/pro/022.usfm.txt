\c 22
\q
\v 1 A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches,
\q And loving favor rather than silver and gold.
\q
\v 2 The rich and the poor meet together:
\q Jehovah is the maker of them all.
\q
\v 3 A prudent man sees the evil, and hides himself;
\q But the simple pass on, and suffer for it.
\q
\v 4 The reward of humility and the fear of Jehovah
\q Is riches, and honor, and life.
\q
\v 5 Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse:
\q He that keeps his soul shall be far from them.
\q
\v 6 Train up a child in the way he should go,
\q And even when he is old he will not depart from it.
\q
\v 7 The rich rules over the poor;
\q And the borrower is servant to the lender.
\q
\v 8 He that sows iniquity shall reap calamity;
\q And the rod of his wrath shall fail.
\q
\v 9 He that has a bountiful eye shall be blessed;
\q For he gives of his bread to the poor.
\q
\v 10 Cast out the scoffer, and contention will go out;
\q Yea, strife and ignominy will cease.
\q
\v 11 He that loves pureness of heart,
\q For the grace of his lips the king will be his friend.
\q
\v 12 The eyes of Jehovah preserve him that has knowledge;
\q But he overthrows the words of the treacherous man.
\q
\v 13 The sluggard saith, There is a lion without;
\q I shall be slain in the streets.
\q
\v 14 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit;
\q He that is abhorred of Jehovah shall fall therein.
\q
\v 15 Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child;
\q But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.
\q
\v 16 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his gain,
\q And he that gives to the rich, shall come only to want.
\b
\q
\v 17 Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise,
\q And apply your heart to my knowledge.
\q
\v 18 For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within thee,
\q If they be established together upon your lips.
\q
\v 19 That your trust may be in Jehovah,
\q I have made them known to you this day, even to you.
\q
\v 20 Have not I written to you excellent things
\q Of counsels and knowledge,
\q
\v 21 To make you know the certainty of the words of truth,
\q That you may carry back words of truth to them that send thee?
\q
\v 22 Rob not the poor, because he is poor;
\q Neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:
\q
\v 23 For Jehovah will plead their cause,
\q And despoil of life those that despoil them.
\q
\v 24 Make no friendship with a man that is given to anger;
\q And with a wrathful man you shall not go:
\q
\v 25 Lest you learn his ways,
\q And get a snare to your soul.
\q
\v 26 Be you not one of them that strike hands,
\q Or of them that are sureties for debts.
\q
\v 27 If you have not wherewith to pay,
\q Why should he take away your bed from under thee?
\q
\v 28 Remove not the ancient landmark,
\q Which your fathers have set.
\q
\v 29 Seest you a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings;
\q He shall not stand before mean men.
