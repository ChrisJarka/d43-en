===== Skills Training =====

//This answers the question:// //What is the skills training approach to audio?//

Skills are perhaps the most valuable, yet underrated asset in any audio project. Gaining, sharpening and maintaining skills takes effort and time investment. However, for a recordist working toward excellence, there is great joy and appreciation for learning, strengthening and improving skills. In fact, a wise recordist not only enjoys learning, but values it as an important, continual process.

Some people assume that upgrading to more expensive, advanced-level equipment will be a fast and easy substitute for skills. In reality, advanced-level equipment is typically more challenging to use properly, especially for people that never gained basic skills in the first place. Also, expensive equipment typically means increased complexity in the recording setup, which works against the principles discussed in the Simplicity module.

Another misconception is that “IT” or “Tech” skill sets are an automatic substitute for media creation skill sets. This assumption may come from the casual observation that technology is used. However, technology is actually used in most, if not all professions across the world and we would not assume an IT person automatically possesses the skills of a doctor, pilot or teacher. It is true that many technically skilled people are also skilled at creative arts and working in a team context with creative artists, but it is important to understand that IT and Media Creation skill sets are not the same thing. Audio recording is a creative process, not a mechanical or technical process.

The approach that has the best strength for the dynamic, interpersonal, creative process of audio recording is anchored in skills, not equipment. Skills live on when the equipment fails. Skills know what to do when troubleshooting is needed. Skills recognize when the equipment is working fine but the recording is not coming together properly. Skills know how to adapt to the best alternative solution. Skills are sensitive to the dynamics of the creative process, hour by hour. Skills find and build upon the unique strengths of each team member. No piece of equipment can do these things and a technical understanding of the mechanics is not sufficient.

Because skills training is so important, much of the content of this handbook is dedicated to skills training on essential audio principles. Our reliance must be on skills, not equipment.
