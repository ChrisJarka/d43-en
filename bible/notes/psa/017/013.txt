===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Rescue my life from the wicked by your sword ... Rescue me from men by your hand, Yahweh, from men of this world** - These two clauses have similar meanings. The repetition adds intensity to the writer's words. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])  
  * **by your sword ... by your hand** - Here "sword" and "hand" both represent the power of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **You will fill the bellies of your treasured ones with riches** - The ancient text is hard to understand. Possible meanings are 1) "treasured" is a metaphor for loved, and "your treasured ones" refers to the people whom God loves. AT: "you will fill the bellies of the people you love with riches" or 2) "your treasured ones" refers to treasures that God gives to people, the "men of this world." AT: "you will fill their bellies with rich treasures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You will fill the bellies ... with riches** - Here "fill the bellies ... with riches" is a metaphor for giving them many valuable things. Possible meanings are 1) "You will give many riches to the people you love" or 2) "you will give the men of this world many riches" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
