\v 11 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to
thee? And he said to them, You know the man and what his talk was.
\v 12 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying, Thus says Jehovah, I have
anointed you king over Israel.
\v 13 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet,
saying, Jehu is king.
