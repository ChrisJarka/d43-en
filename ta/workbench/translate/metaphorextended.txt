==== Description ====

An extended metaphor occurs when someone speaks of a situation as if it were a different situation. He does this in order to effectively describe the first situation by implying that in some important way it is similar to the other. The second situation has multiple **images** of people, things, and actions that represent those in the first situation. 
 
=== Reasons this is a translation issue  ===
  * People may not realize that the images represent other things.
  * People may not be familiar with the things that are used as images. 
  * Such extended metaphors are often so profound that a translator would find it impossible to show all of the meaning generated by the metaphor.

=== Translation Principles  ===
  * Make the meaning of the extended metaphor as clear to the target audience as it was to the original audience.
  * Do not make the meaning more clear to the target audience than it was to the original audience.
  * When someone uses an extended metaphor, the images are an important part of what he is trying to say.
  * If the target audience is not familiar with some of the images, you will need to find some way of helping them understand the images so they can understand the whole extended metaphor.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

In Psalm 23, the writer says that God's concern and care for his people can be pictured as the care that a good shepherd has for his flock of sheep. Shepherds give sheep what they need, take them to safe places, rescue them, guide them, and protect them. What God does for his people is like these actions in important ways.

><sup>1</sup>Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing.
><sup>2</sup>He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
>he leads me beside tranquil water.
><sup>3</sup>He brings back my life;
>he guides me along right paths for his name's sake.
><sup>4</sup>Even though I walk through a valley of darkest shadow,
>I will not fear harm since you are with me;
>your rod and your staff comfort me. (Psalm 23:1-4 ULB)

In Psalm 23, Isaiah presents God's disappointment with his people as a farmer who is disappointed with a vineyard that only produces bad fruit. Farmers care for their gardens and protect them, but if they only produce bad fruit, farmers eventually stop caring for them. 

><sup>1</sup>...My well beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
><sup>2</sup>He spaded it and removed the stones, and planted it with the choicest vine.
>He built a tower in the middle of it, and also built a winepress.
>He waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced wild grapes. 

><sup>3</sup>So now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah;
>judge between me and my vineyard.
><sup>4</sup>What more could have been done for my vineyard, that I have not done for it?
>When I looked for it to produce grapes, why did it produce wild grapes?
><sup>5</sup> Now I will inform you what I will do to my vineyard; I will remove the hedge;
>I will turn it into a pasture; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled on.
><sup>6</sup>I will lay it waste, and it will not be pruned nor hoed. But briers and thorns will spring up,
> I will also command the clouds not to rain on it.

><sup>7</sup>For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel,
>and the men of Judah his pleasant planting;
>he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing;
>for righteousness, but, instead, a cry for help. (Isaiah 5:1-2 ULB)

==== Translation Strategies ====
If people would understand the metaphor in the same way that the original readers would have understood it, consider using it. If not, here are some other strategies.

  - If the target audience would think that the images should be understood literally, change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding "like" or "as."
  - If the target audience would not know the **image,** find a way of translating it so they can understand what it is.
  - If the target audience still would not understand what the extended metaphor teaches, state it clearly.


==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. If the target audience would think that the images should be understood literally, translate it as a simile by using "like" or "as." It may be enough to to do this in just the first sentence or two.

><sup>1</sup>Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing.
><sup>2</sup>He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
>he leads me beside tranquil water. (Psalm 23:1-2 ULB)

  * <sup>1</sup>Yahweh is __like__ a shepherd to me so I will lack nothing. 
  * <sup>2</sup>__Like__ a shepherd who makes his sheep lie down in green pastures and leads them by peaceful waters, 
  * Yahweh helps me to rest peacefully."


2. If the target audience would not know the **image,** find a way of translating it so they can understand what it is.

><sup>1</sup>...My well beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
><sup>2</sup>He spaded it and removed the stones, and planted it with the choicest vine.
>He built a tower in the middle of it, and also built a winepress.
>He waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced wild grapes. 

  * "<sup>1</sup>...My well beloved had a __grapevine garden__ on a very fertile hill.
  * <sup>2</sup>He spaded it and removed the stones, and planted it with __the best grapevines__.
  * He built a __watchtower__ in the middle of it, and also built __a tank where he could crush the juice out of the wine__.
  * He waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced __wild grapes that were not good for making wine__. 



3 If the target audience still would not understand what the extended metaphor teaches, state it clearly.

><sup>1</sup>Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing. (Psalm 23:1 ULB)

  * <sup>1</sup>Yahweh __cares for me__ like a shepherd that cares for his sheep, so I will lack nothing. 


>For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel,
>and the men of Judah his pleasant planting;
>he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing;
>for righteousness, but, instead, a cry for help. (Isaiah 5:7 ULB)

  * "For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel,
  * and the men of Judah his pleasant planting;
  * he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing;
  * for righteousness, but, instead, a cry for help. 
  * __So as a farmer stops caring for a grapevine garden that produces bad fruit, Yahweh will stop protecting Israel and Judah.__"
