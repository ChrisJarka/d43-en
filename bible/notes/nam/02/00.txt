====== Nahum 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:1-13, which is a poetic prophecy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

Despite being divided into three chapters, they all consist of one long prophecy.
