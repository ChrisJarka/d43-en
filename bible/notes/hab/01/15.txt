\q
\v 15 They bring up all of them with fishhooks; they drag men away in fishnets
\q and gather them in their net. This is why they rejoice and shout exuberantly.
\q
\v 16 Therefore he offers sacrifice to his net and burns incense to his dragnet,
\q for by his net he lives in luxury, and his food is the richest kind.
\q
\v 17 Will they therefore empty their fishing nets and continue to slaughter the nations, feeling no compassion?"

  * **They bring up all of them with fishhooks ... gather them in their net** - Habakkuk speaks of the Chaldeans conquering people easily as if the people were fish that the Chaldeans catch with fishhooks and fishnets. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **fishhooks ... fishnets ... dragnet** - tools used to catch fish
  * **he offers sacrifice to his net and burns incense to his dragnet** - Habakkuk speaks of the weapons that the Chaldeans use to conquer people and nations as if the weapons were fishing nets that they use to catch fish.

  * **Will they therefore empty their fishing nets and continue to slaughter the nations, feeling no compassion?** - Habakkuk asks this question because he is frustrated and wants to how long Yahweh will allow the Chaldeans to continue to destroy people and nations.
