\c 16
\p
\v 1 I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church that is at Cenchreae:
\v 2 that you receive her in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may have need of
you: for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of mine own self.
\p
\v 3 Salute Prisca and Aquila my fellow-workers in Christ Jesus,
\v 4 who for my life laid down their own necks; to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles:
\v 5 and salute the church that is in their house. Salute Epaenetus my beloved, who is the first fruits of Asia to
Christ.
\v 6 Salute Mary, who bestowed much labor on you.
\v 7 Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also have been
in Christ before me.
\v 8 Salute Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord.
\v 9 Salute Urbanus our fellow-worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
\v 10 Salute Apelles the approved in Christ. Salute them that are of the
household of Aristobulus.
\v 11 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Salute them of the household
of Narcissus, that are in the Lord.
\v 12 Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Salute Persis the beloved, who labored much in the Lord.
\v 13 Salute Rufus the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
\v 14 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren that are with them.
\v 15 Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints that are with them.
\v 16 Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.
\p
\v 17 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them that are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the
doctrine which you learned: and turn away from them.
\v 18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and fair speech they decieve
the hearts of the innocent.
\v 19 For your obedience is come abroad to all men. I rejoice therefore over you: but I would have you wise to that which
is good, and simple to that which is evil.
\v 20 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
\p The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
\p
\v 21 Timothy my fellow-worker saluteth you; and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
\v 22 I Tertius, who write the epistle, salute you in the Lord.
\v 23 Gaius my host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth you, and Quartus the
brother.
\v 24 \f + Some ancient authorities insert here v. 24 \fqa The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
\ft and omit the like words in v 20.\f*
\p
\v 25 Now to him that is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the
revelation of the mystery which has been kept in silence through times eternal,
\v 26 but now is manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made
known to all the nations to obedience of faith:
\v 27 to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory for ever. Amen.
