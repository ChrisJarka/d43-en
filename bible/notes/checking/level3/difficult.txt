===== Difficult Passages =====

This section will be more book-specific and will help the church understand how the translators handled difficult passages.

Q? How does the national language Bible handle variations of text? Does it use footnotes?

A.  (When the community looked at the verse numbering of the national translation, were all of the verses included in the language translation?)

Q? How has the translator and the local community chosen to handle differences of numbering, missing verses, and variations in the text?

A.  (Have they followed the lead of the national language Bible? Will they use footnotes for alternate translations?)

Q? What cultural issues are there in the local community that make a passage in the book difficult to translate?

A.  (In difficult areas do the community leaders feel that the translator used language that covers the same message as found in the national language?)
