====== Active or Passive ======

The English language has the active and passive forms of speech.

  * In the **ACTIVE**  form, the subject does the action.
  * In the **PASSIVE**  form, the action is done to the subject.

==== Why/How the Passive is Used in English ====

  - To avoid focusing on the person who is doing the action. So that the reader is focused on the person, or thing, to which the action was done.
  - The person that did the action is not known. (My bike was stolen last night.)
  - The writer may not want to openly name the person that does the action. (The stones will be torn down.)
  - For effect, to emphasize an idea while minimizing other ideas.

==== Roles ====


The following terms may be used to talk about active and passive clauses.\\
**Actor** - The one who does something.\\
**Patient** - The one something is done to.\\
**Recipient** - The one who receives something.\\
**Addressee** - The one who is spoken to. \\

In an active clause, the subject is often the actor. In these examples, the subject is __underlined__.\\

  * //__John__ gave the book to Mary.// John is the actor. 
  * //__They__ told me all about it.// The pronoun “they” is the actor.

In a passive clause, the subject is the patient, recipient, or addressee.
  * //__The book__ was given to Mary.// The book is the patient. 
  * //__Mary__ was given the book.// Mary is the recipient. 
  * //__I__ was told all about it.//  The pronoun “I” is the addressee.


===== Examples from English =====

**Active**  - Peter built the house. \\ **Passive**  - The house was built by Peter.

**Active**  - Worms ate the apple. \\ **Passive**  - The apple was eaten by worms.

Ask yourself: Who or What is the subject in this sentence?

  * In the **ACTIVE**  form, the subject that does the action is always mentioned.
  * In the **PASSIVE**  form, the subject that does the action is //not always//  mentioned.

If you are confused about the subject, ask yourself: What action took place…and who/what received the action.

Typically, confusion is more likely in passive sentences.

For example, consider this passive voice sentence: The dinner was enjoyed by all.

Dinner is the subject. The verb for this sentence is a phrase: 'was enjoyed.' (Note: Was is a state-of-being very and those are often found in passive sentences.)

To turn this into an active form, consider who enjoyed the meal. Switching to: 'All enjoyed dinner.' gives you an active voice sentence with the same meaning.

In summary: To change a **PASSIVE**  form to an **ACTIVE**  form it is necessary to state who, or what, did the action.

For example: \\ **Passive **- …. and when Jesus was baptized. \\ **Active **- … and when //John//  baptized Jesus.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Luke 3:9 //"Already the ax has been placed against the root of the trees. So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire"//

**every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down** - This is a passive clause. It can be translated with an active clause “He chops down every tree that does not produce good fruit.”

Luke 17:1-2 //Jesus said to his disciples, "It is certain that things that cause sin will come, but woe to him through whom they come! It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble."//

**if a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown** - This could also be translated with active clauses: “if they were to put a millstone around his neck and throw him” or “if someone were to put a heavy stone around his neck and push him.”
===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Many languages do not have a passive form, only the active form exists. Therefore, it may be necessary to turn a sentence from the passive form into the active form.
  * To change a passive form to an active form it will be necessary to state openly who did the action.
  * Consider why the passive form was used in the verse. There should be ways of achieving the same effect in the translation.

Ideas on Changing the Passive Form

Does your language have a non-specific form of the pronoun? This might be translated as "they did something" or "one did something" where "they" or "one" does not refer to anyone in particular. If so, then this form can be used to translate the English passive, especially in the cases where the person doing the action is not stated openly.

Some languages have both the passive and active forms; however, the language does not use them in the same way.

**Consider carefully how to best use the forms in your language before using the passive form wherever the English language does.**
