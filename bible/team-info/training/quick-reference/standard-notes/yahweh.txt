====== Yahweh ======

===== Description =====

The name "Yahweh" is often translated as "LORD" or "Jehovah" in many modern versions. It is used so often that it is a KT. However, we suggest that it might be helpful to add a note at the beginning of a book where it is used.

===== Standard Notes =====

  * **Yahweh**  - This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the note on the Important Term page concerning how to translate this. (Use this note the first time ”Yahweh” occurs in an OT book. Otherwise, just listed Yahweh in the Important Terms list.)
