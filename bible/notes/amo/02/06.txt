  * **For three sins of ... even for four** - This poetic device is not meant to imply that a specific number of sins had been committed, but to communicate that an abundance of sins had led to God's judgment. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:01:03|1:3]].
  * **Israel** - This represents the Israelite people. AT: "the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will not turn away punishment** - Yahweh uses two negatives here for emphasis. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:01:03|1:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **the innocent** - This refers to innocent people in general. AT: "innocent people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]])
