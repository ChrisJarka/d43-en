====== Proverbs 24 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapter 24 continues the section of the book (Chapter 23:15-24:22) and is filled mainly with individual Proverbs. 

The second half of this chapter finishes up the section called "The Sayings of the Wise Men". 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Lazy Man Story ==

Unlike much of Proverbs, verse 30-34 tells a little story about a lazy man which ends in a very quotable proverb.

== Parallelism ==

Proverbs are often written without any surrounding context and in two lines of text. Each line will have a certain relationship to the other line. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Many of the proverbs are stated as promises or commands but they are intended to be advice.  

== Themes ==

There are individual proverbs that run along common themes: wise vs foolish, money, lazy vs diligent, truth telling, wicked vs righteous, sluggard, pride vs humility, integrity vs crookedness etc.
