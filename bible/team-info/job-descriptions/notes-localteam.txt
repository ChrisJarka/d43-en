====== Translation Notes Team Information ======

==== Team Purpose ====

Each Notes Team will work through each verse of their assigned book of the Bible and identify the significant issues that may be difficult in translating that verse. The team will address these issues in the following ways:

  * Identify and list, in order of appearance, in the ULB Important Terms
  * Write concise, helpful explanatory notes on each word or phrase that is unclear or difficult to translate.

All of the content developed will be released as open-source, unrestricted materials. No copyrighted materials should be included in their creation. It is also understood that the team agrees to have the product of their work freely distributed as open-licensed.

==== Team Leader Responsibilities ====

The team leader will be responsible for the following:

  * Follow the schedule set by the Translation Notes Teams Manager to rapidly and conscientiously work through the assigned book.
  * Assign tasks to the team members as needed so the project moves along.
  * Encourage and guide the team members in the development of the notes.
  * Add a comment in the discussion panel about any suggested changes to the UDB and ULB text and notify the Translation Notes Teams Manager of the suggestion.
  * Use the “ktlink” tag to keep the KT team updated on requests for new Key Terms.
  * Suggest updates to the existing KT pages to Translation Notes Teams Manager.
  * Use the "talink" tag to notify the translationAcademy team of references to present tA pages or creation of a new tA topic.
  * Communicate with the Translation Notes Teams Manager any concerns and issues with the team members or the project.
  * Tag the page 'review' when the team has completed their work.
