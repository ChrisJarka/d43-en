\v 7 Think about this: It is land on which rain has frequently fallen \f + \ft personification \f* and on which plants grow \f + \ft personification \f* that is useful for the people who prepare the land that God has blessed. \add Similarly, it is those believers who have received many good things from God and who do good deeds\f + \ft Or: things \f* that please God, whom God will bless\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 8 But \add what will happen to believers who do deeds\f + \ft Or: things \f* that do not please God will be like what happens to land\add* on which \add only\add* thorns and thistles grow \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Such land\add* is worthless.

\v 7 For the land which has received the rain that often falls upon it, and produces a crop helpful for those who worked the land, receives a blessing from God.
\v 8 But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to a curse and will be burned.
