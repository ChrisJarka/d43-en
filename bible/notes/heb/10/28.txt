====== Hebrews 10:28-29 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 Everyone who rejected the laws \add that God gave\add* Moses was mercilessly killed when \add at least\add* two or three people testified that they had done that.
\v 29 \add That was severe punishment\add*. But \add Christ\add* is God's Son\f + \ft Or: the man who is also God \f*. His blood, by means of which \add he put into effect\add* the new covenant, is sacred. Because of \add Christ's\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* blood \add flowing for us when he died\add*, \add God\add* freed us from our guilt. So, you can be sure \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that anyone who shows contempt for \add those truths\add* and who insults the Spirit of God, the one who acts with kindness toward us in a way we do not deserve, deserves to be punished even worse than that \f + \ft metaphor \f*!

\v 28 A man that has rejected Mosesâ€™ law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses:
\v 29 of how much more punishment, do you think he will receive who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has declared unholy the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
