\q
\v 1 The fool has said in his heart, There is no God.
\q Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity;
\q There is none that does good.
\q
\v 2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men,
\q To see if there were any that did understand,
\q That did seek after God.
\q
\v 3 Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy;
\q There is none that does good, no, not one.
