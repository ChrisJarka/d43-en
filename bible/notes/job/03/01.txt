===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **opened his mouth **- "began to speak"
  * **Let the day on which I was born perish **- This is figurative language. It is like saying "I wish that I had never been born."
  * **the day ... the night**  - Both day and night refer to the same day of Job's birth.
  * **the night that said, ‘A boy has been born'**
 - This is the second line of a poetic couplet. So one needs to supply the verb from the previous line. One could translate this as "Let the night that said, 'A boy has been norn', perish."
  * **the night that said**  - In reality the night does not speak; people do. This is a poetic way of saying "the night when people said."
  * **bold words**  - explanation
