\v 7 God also allowed the beast to fight against his people and conquer them. It had authority to rule over every tribe, over every nation, over the speakers of every language, and over every people-group.
\v 8 All the people living on earth will worship it. They are the people whose names are not in the Book of Life that belongs to the lamb who had been killed. These are the names of the people that he wrote in the book before God created the world, the names of those who belong to God.
