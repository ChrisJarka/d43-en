====== Jeremiah 05:4-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 I thought, "\add We cannot expect\add* these people \add to act righteously, because they\add* are poor;
\q2 they do not have any sense.
\q1 They do not know the way Yahweh wants them to conduct their lives;
\q2 they do not know what God requires them to do.
\q1
\v 5 So, I will go and talk to their leaders,
\q2 because they surely know how God wants them to conduct their lives."
\q1 But they also have stopped obeying Yahweh \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\q2 and they will not allow him to lead them.
\q1
\v 6 Because of that, lions will come out of the forests and kill them;
\q2 wolves from the desert will attack them;
\q2 leopards that lurk\f + \ft Or: wait \f* outside their cities will maul anyone who walks outside the cities.
\q1 Those things will happen because the people have sinned very much against God
\q2 and have turned away from him very frequently.

\q
\v 4 So I said, â€œSurely these are poor;
\q They are foolish for they do not know the way of Yahweh, the judgment of their God!
\q
\v 5 I must take myself to the great men and declare to them, for they at least know the way of Yahweh,
\q the judgments of their God! Surely They will shatter the yoke together! They will tear apart fetters!
\q
\v 6 Therefore a lion from the thicket will strike them! A wolf of the Arabah will devastate them!
\q A lurking panther will be against their cities! All the ones going out from them will be torn apart!
\q For their transgressions multiply! Their apostasies are unlimited!
