\v 13 It is right for God to punish them because it is not those who merely know God's laws whom he considers to be righteous. On the contrary, it is only those who continually have obeyed all of God's Law whom God will consider righteous.
\v 14 Whenever the non-Jews, who do not have the Law of God, naturally obey those laws, they prove that they have a law within their own minds, even though they do not actually have the laws that God gave to Moses.

\v 13 For it is not the hearers of the Law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the Law who will be justified.
\v 14 For when Gentiles, who do not have the Law, do by nature the things of the Law, they, not having the Law, are a law to themselves.
