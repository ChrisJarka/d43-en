\v 54 And it was so, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Jehovah, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven.

\v 56 Blessed be Jehovah, that has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there has not failed
