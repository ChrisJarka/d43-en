Since God has done so much for you\f + \ft Or: us \f*\add*, this is the \add only\add* appropriate way to serve him. \v 2 Do not let anything non-Christian determine how you should act. Instead, let God change your \add way of life\add* by making your way of thinking new, in order that you may know what he wants you to do. That is, you will know what is good, and you will know what pleases\add God\add*, and you will know how to be all that he wants you to be.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 1 My fellow believers, since God has acted mercifully toward you in so many ways, I appeal to all of you that you present yourselves like a sacrifice that you give to God alone. This is the only right way to worship him. \v 2 Do not let unbelievers guide you in how you behave. Instead, let God change your way of thinking and always make it new, in order that you may know what he wants you to do, so you may know how to act in ways that please him, the ways in which he himself acts.
