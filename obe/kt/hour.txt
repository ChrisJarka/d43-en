====== hour ======

===== Definition: =====

In addition to being used to refer to when or how long something took place, the term "hour" is also used in several figurative ways:

  * Sometimes "hour" refers to a regular, scheduled time to do something, such as "the hour of prayer."
  * The phrase, "in that very hour" or "the same hour" means "at that moment" or "at that time" or "immediately."
  * When the text says that the "hour had come" for Jesus to suffer and be put to death, this meant that it was the appointed time that God had decided long ago that this would happen.
  * When used figuratively, the term "hour" can be translated as "time" or "moment" or "appointed time."
