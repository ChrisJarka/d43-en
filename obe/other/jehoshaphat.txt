===== Facts: =====

Jehoshaphat is the name of at least two men in the Old Testament.

  * The most well-known man by this name was King Jehoshaphat who was the fourth king to rule over the kingdom of Judah.
  * He restored peace between Judah and Israel, and destroyed the altars of false gods.
  * Another Jehoshaphat was a "recorder" for King David and King Solomon. He took care of practical matters such as drafting documents for the king to sign and writing down the history of all the important events that happened in the kingdom.
