\v 17 Have you forgotten what happened at Peor, \add when some Israelites sinned by worshiping the god that the Moab people-group worship\add*? Many Israelites became very sick and died because of that sin, and we are still suffering because of their sin.
\v 18 Are you now turning away from obeying Yahweh and refusing to do what he wants? If you do not stop right now rebelling against Yahweh today, he will be angry with all of us Israelites tomorrow.'

<usfm>
\v 17 Have you forgotten about how Yahweh punished us at Peor, when we turned and worshiped other gods? Yahweh sent a deadly sickness among the people of Israel and many died from it.
\v 18 Have you, too, turned away from following Yahweh by building this altar?  If you do this, Yahweh will be angry with all the people of Israel.'

\v 17 Was our sin at Peor not enough for us, and yet we have not cleansed ourselves, and for which there came a plague upon the assembly of Yahweh,
