\p
\v 34 Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you are in your enemiesâ€™ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.
\v 35 As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when you lived upon it.
\v 36 And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
