\v 22 And Yahweh God said, "Now the man has become as one of us, knowing good and evil, so now he must not be allowed to put forth his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat it, and live forever."
\v 23 Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he was taken.
\v 24 So he drove out the man and he placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, with a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
