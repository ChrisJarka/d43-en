\q1
\v 2 They will take out their bones \add from their graves\add* and \add dishonor them by\add* scattering them on the ground under the sun and the moon and the stars—

\c 8
\p
\v 1 At that time, says Jehovah, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the
bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;
\v 2 and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they
have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and which they have worshipped: they shall not be
gathered, nor be buried, they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
\v 3 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the
places whither I have driven them, says Jehovah of hosts.
