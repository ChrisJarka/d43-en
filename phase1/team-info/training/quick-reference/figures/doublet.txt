====== Doublet ======


===== Description =====

We are using the word **doublet** to refer to two words or very short phrases that mean the same thing and that are joined with the word "and." This is often used to emphasize or intensify the idea expressed by the two words.

Note: We are using the term **parallelism** for __long phrases or clauses__ that are similar in grammatical structure or idea, with one immediately following the other.
