====== watchtower ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "watchtower" refers to a tall structure built as a place from which guards could look out for any danger.

  * Landowners built stone towers to protect their crops from being stolen. The towers often included living quarters so that the watchmen could guard the crops day and night.
  * Cities that were surrounded by walls would have watchtowers built higher than the walls so that watchmen could see if any enemies were coming to attack the city.
