====== 2 Corinthians 04 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===
This chapter begins with the word "therefore," which is connected to the teaching in the previous chapter. The awkward placement of the chapter division can cause confusion. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Ministry ==

Paul has the ministry or job of telling people about Christ. He does not use trickery to get them to believe. If they do not understand, the problem is ultimately [[:en:obe:kt:spirit|spiritual]]. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

= Light and Darkness ==
These are common images in the New Testament. [[:en:obe:kt:light|Light]] is used here to indicate the revelation of God and his [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]]. [[:en:obe:kt:darkness|Darkness]] describes [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] and sin seeks to remain hidden from God. In this chapter, light also represents [[:en:obe:kt:true|truth]].

== Life and death ==
[[:en:obe:kt:life|Life]] and [[:en:obe:kt:death|death]] are not used in reference to physical life and death. Life represents the new life a Christian has in Jesus, while death represents the old way of living prior to [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]] in Jesus. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Hope ==
Paul uses opposite concepts in a purposeful way. He makes a statement and then denies a seemingly opposite or contradictory statement. They function to give [[:en:obe:kt:hope|hope]] in the midst of difficult circumstances.
