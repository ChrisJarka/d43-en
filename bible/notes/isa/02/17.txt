===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The pride of man will be brought low and the haughtiness of men will fall**  - This is saying the same thing twice in two different ways to emphasize that God will cause people to no longer be proud. Also, this is a passive sentence. This could be translated as an active sentence: "He will cause people to no longer be arrogant." (UDB) (See: Doublet and Active)
  * **Yahweh alone will be exalted **- This can be translated with an active clause: "people will praise and honor only Yahweh." (UDB)
  * **on that day**  - This is a metonym that refers to when Yahweh will judge all people. This can be translated as "on the day that he comes to judge everyone." (See: metonymy)
  * **The idols will completely pass away - **  "God will destroy all idols"
  * **the caves of the rocks…the holes of the ground**  - in prophecy may describe the tribulation time as man runs for his life
  * **the terror of Yahweh…the splendor of his majesty- **  in prophecy, the awesome power of the Almighty's righteous judgment
  * **when he rises to terrify the earth**  - when Yahweh appears to bring deserved judgment on the earth for man's sin
