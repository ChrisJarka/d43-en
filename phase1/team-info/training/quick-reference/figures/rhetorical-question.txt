====== Rhetorical Question ======

===== Description =====

A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. An answer is not usually expected. It may be used to introduce a topic that the speaker wants to talk about or to encourage the audience to think deeply about something they already know. At times, rhetorical questions are used to express deep emotion or for sarcasm, rebuking or scolding.
