===== translationNotes: =====

  * **to those who put off the day of disaster** - Refusing to believe that Yahweh will cause disaster is spoken of as if the "day of disaster" were an object the people could put far from themselves. AT: "to those who refuse to believe that I will cause them to experience disaster" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and make the throne of violence come near** - Here "throne" is a metonym that represents reign or rule. The people doing evil things which causes Yahweh to bring disaster on them is spoken of as if they causing "violence" to rule them. AT: "but who are actually causing me to send violent people to destroy you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **lie ... lounge** - Israelites at that time usually ate while sitting on a floor cloth or a simple seat.
  * **beds of ivory** - "beds decorated with ivory" or "costly beds"
  * **ivory** - a white substance made from the teeth and horns of large animals (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **lounge** - "lie around like lazy people"
  * **couches** - soft seats large enough to lie down on
