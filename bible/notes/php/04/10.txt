\v 10 I rejoice greatly \add and thank\add* the Lord because now, after some time, \add by sending money to me\add* you have once again shown that you are concerned about me \f + \ft euphemism \f*. Indeed, you were concerned about me \add all the time\add*, but you had no opportunity \add to show that you were concerned about me\add*.
\v 11 I am saying this not because I \add am concerned that I\add* lack things \add that I need\add*. In fact, I have learned to be content in whatever \add situation\add* I am.
\v 12 \add Specifically\add*, I know how \add to be content when\add* I do not have what I need, and I know how \add to be content when\add* I have plenty. I have learned how \add to be content\add* in any and every \add situation\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*. \add Specifically\add*, I have learned how \add to be content when\add* I have enough to eat, and I have learned how \add to be content when\add* I do not have enough to eat. I have learned how \add to be content when\add* I have plenty \f + \ft doublet \f* \add of what I need\add*, and I have learned \add how to be content when\add* I lack \add things\add*.

\v 10 But I rejoice in the Lord greatly because now at length, you have renewed your thoughts for me. Although you did indeed take thought previously, but you lacked opportunity.
\v 11 I am not speaking  of my needs for I have learned to be content in all circumstances.
\v 12 I know how to live in times of need, and I also know how to in times of abundance.  I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.
\v 13 I can do all things in him that strengthens me.
