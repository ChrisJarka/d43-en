\v 11 If I had done something bad \add for which I\add* should be executed \f + \ft Or:\add concerning which the law said that they\add* should execute me \f*, I would not plead \add with them that they\add* not kill me. But none of these things about which they accuse me is \add true, so\add* no one can \add legally\add* surrender me to \add these Jews\add*. So I formally request that the emperor \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add should judge me at Rome\add*."
\v 12 Then after Festus conferred with the \add men who regularly\add* advised him, he replied to Paul, "You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* have formally requested \add that I should send you\add* to the emperor \add in Rome.

\v 11 If I had done anything deserving of death, I would not refuse to to die; but there is nothing that they accuse me of that deserves such a punishment. No one can condemn me just to satisfy them. I ask that Caesar himself judge me."
\v 12 After Festus conferred with his advisors, he said, "You have appealed to Caesar, and so to Caesar you shall go!"
