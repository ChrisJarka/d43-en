\v 13 "You are able to influence evil people and improve the way they live in order that they do not become more evil, just like salt is able to improve the flavor of food and to preserve it from spoiling. Salt that no longer tastes salty cannot become salty again. As a result, that salt becomes useless. It is rejected by people, thrown on the ground, and walked on. Similarly, if the way you live no longer influences people to live in a godly manner, God will reject you.
\v 14 You enable evil people to perceive God's truth as a light enables people to perceive what is around them. Just like everyone can see the lights of a city on a hill, other people can see what you do.

\v 13 You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good
for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid.
