\v 3 Then the word of Yahweh came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying,
\q
\v 4 "Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your finished houses,
\q while this house lies ruined?
\q
\v 5 So now Yahweh of hosts says this:
\q Consider your ways!
\q
\v 6 You have sown much seed, but bring in little harvest; you eat but do not have enough;
\q you drink but cannot get drunk. You wear clothes but cannot warm yourselves,
\q and the wage earner earns money only to put it into a bag full of holes!

  * **but cannot get drunk** - There is not enough wine to satisfy the people's thirst and not nearly enough for drunkenness. The reader should understand that the text is not calling drunkenness a good thing.
