\v 4 I heard another voice from heaven  say, 
\q2 "Come away, my people, come out of her 
\q3 so that you may have no participation in her sins, 
\q2 and so that you not receive any of her plagues.
\q
\v 5 For her sins have piled up to heaven, 
\q2 and God has remembered her wrongs.
\q
\v 6 Pay to her just as she has paid, 
\q2 and repay to her the double according to her deeds. 
\q2 In the cup which she mixed, mix double for her.
