\v 3 Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature; and its
top was among the thick boughs.
\v 4 The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow: the rivers thereof ran round about its plantation; and it sent out its
channels to all the trees of the field.
