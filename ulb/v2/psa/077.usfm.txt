\c 77
\d For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 I will cry to God with my voice,
\q Even to God with my voice; and he will give ear to me.
\q
\v 2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord:
\q My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not;
\q My soul refused to be comforted.
\q
\v 3 I remember God, and am disquieted:
\q I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. \qs [Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 4 You holdest mine eyes watching:
\q I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
\q
\v 5 I have considered the days of old,
\q The years of ancient times.
\q
\v 6 I call to remembrance my song in the night:
\q I commune with mine own heart;
\q And my spirit makes diligent search.
\q
\v 7 Will the Lord cast off for ever?
\q And will he be favorable no more?
\q
\v 8 Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever?
\q Doth his promise fail for evermore?
\q
\v 9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious?
\q Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 10 And I said, This is my infirmity;
\q But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.
\q
\v 11 I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah;
\q For I will remember your wonders of old.
\q
\v 12 I will meditate also upon all your work,
\q And muse on your doings.
\q
\v 13 Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary:
\q Who is a great god like to God?
\q
\v 14 You are the God that do wonders:
\q You have made known your strength among the peoples.
\q
\v 15 You have with your arm redeemed your people,
\q The sons of Jacob and Joseph. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 16 The waters saw thee, O God;
\q The waters saw thee, they were afraid:
\q The depths also trembled.
\q
\v 17 The clouds poured out water;
\q The skies sent out a sound:
\q Your arrows also went abroad.
\q
\v 18 The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind;
\q The lightnings lightened the world:
\q The earth trembled and shook.
\q
\v 19 Your way was in the sea,
\q And your paths in the great waters,
\q And your footsteps were not known.
\q
\v 20 You led your people like a flock,
\q By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
