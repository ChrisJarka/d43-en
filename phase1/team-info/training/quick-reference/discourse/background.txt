====== Background Information ======

===== Description =====

Occasionally an author may take a break from the storyline to share something of interest. This break usually contains background information. An author may use background information for several reasons:

  * To add interest to the story.
  * To provide important historical or cultural information.
  * To tell the reader, or listener, something very important

===== Template =====

The following information should be included in the notes:

  - **Text** - the text that includes or begins the background information from the ULB in bold
  - Clarifying translation - (optional)
  - **Explanation** - Identify the content and purpose of the background information
  - **Alternate translation** - Suggest that translators use their form for background information if one exists
  - **TA link** - unless already in the notes for the chunk

  * **(1) ULB text**  - **(3)** Explanation. **(4)** Suggestion to translator. **(5)** (See: topic)


===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.

=== Genesis 16:16 ===

"Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram."

  * **(1) Abram was eighty-six years old**  - **(3)**  This is background information about Abram's age when these things happened. **(4)**  Your language may have a special way to mark background information. **(5)**  (See: Background Information)
=== Luke 3:23 ===

"Now Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years of age. He was the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, "

  * **(1) Now**  - **(3)**  This word is used here to mark a change from the story to background information about  Jesus' age and ancestors. It ends after Luke 3:37. **(4)**  If your language has a way of showing that what follows is background information, you should use it here. **(5)**  (See: Background Information)
