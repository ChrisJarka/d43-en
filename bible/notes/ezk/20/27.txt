\v 27 Therefore, Son of man, declare to the house of Israel and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: In this your fathers blasphemed me by 
betraying me with treason against me,
\v 28 for when I brought them into the land that I lifted my hand to give to them and they saw all the high hills and leafy trees, then they sacrificed their 
sacrifices there and gave the provocation of their offering there. Then they gave soothing fragrances there and poured out drink offerings there.
\v 29 Then I said to them, “What is this high place where you bring offering there?” So the name is called Bamah to this day.’
