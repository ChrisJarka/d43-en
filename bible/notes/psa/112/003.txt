===== Translation Notes: =====

The person who sings this song continues to describe a person who reveres Yahweh.
  * **his righteousness will endure forever** - "he will always do what is right" or "he will be righteous forever." See how you translated "his righteousness endures forever" in [[en:bible:notes:psa:111:001|111:3]].
  * **Light shines in the darkness for the godly person** - Darkness represents bad things that happen and light represents hope and a way to escape from those bad things. "When bad things happen, righteous people have hope and a way to escape." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who deals graciously** - "who is gracious'
