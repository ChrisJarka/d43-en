\v 36 It is true that everyone sins. So when your people sin against you, and you become angry with them, you might allow their enemies to capture them and take them to their countries, even to countries that are far away.
\v 37 When that happens, while they are in tbose distant countries, if they say 'We have sinned; we have done things that are wrong and have done things that are very wicked,'
\v 38 suppose that they repent very sincerely and pray facing this land that you gave their ancestors, and facing this city that you chose, and facing this temple that I have built for you to be present in.
\v 39 Then from your home in heaven listen to their prayer, and listen to them while they plead for your help, and do what they ask you to do, and forgive your people who have sinned against you.

\p
\v 36 Suppose they sin against you—since there is no one who does not sin—and suppose that you are angry with them and hand them over to the enemy, so that the enemy carries them away and takes them as captives to their land, whether distant or near.
\v 37 Then suppose they realize they are in the land where they have been exiled, and suppose that they repent and seek favor from you in the land of their captivity. Suppose that they say, 'We have acted perversely and sinned. We have behaved wickedly.'
\v 38 Suppose that they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they took them as captives, and suppose that they pray toward their land, which you gave to their ancestors, and toward the city that you chose, and toward the house that I have built for your name.
\v 39 Then listen from the heavens, the place where you live, to their prayer and to their requests, and help their cause. Forgive your people, who have sinned against you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - King Solomon continues praying.

  * **Suppose they sin ... suppose that you are angry ... suppose they realize ... suppose that they repent ... Suppose that they say ... Suppose that they return ... suppose that they pray** - When Solomon was speaking, these hypothetical situations had not happened, but Solomon knew that they might happen in the future. Use the form in your language for talking about events that have not happened but might happen in the future. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **and hand them over to the enemy** - Here "hand them over to the enemy" represents allowing the enemy to capture them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so that the enemy carries them away** - Here "carries them away" represents forcing them to leave their own country. AT: "so that the enemy forces them to leave" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **where they have been exiled** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "where their enemies have taken them as exiles" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **seek favor from you** - "beg you to be merciful to them" 
  * **We have acted perversely and sinned. We have behaved wickedly** - These two sentences mean the same thing. Together they emphasize how bad the people's actions were. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **acted perversely and sinned** - The words mean basically the same thing and emphasize how badly the people sinned. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **they return to you** - Here "return to you" represents submitting to Yahweh again. AT: "they submit to you again" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **with all their heart and with all their soul** - The idiom "with all their heart" means "completely" and "with all their soul" means "with all their being." These two phrases have similar meanings. AT: "completely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **where they took them as captives** - "were their enemies took them as captives"
  * **the house that I have built** - Solomon speaks of commanding the people to build the temple and telling them how to do it as if he himself had built it.  AT: "the house that your people have built under my leadership" or "the house that I and your people have built" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **for your name** - Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh's name represents himself. AT: "for you" or 2) Yahweh's name represents his reputation. AT: "for your reputation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **that they pray toward their land** - This refers to Israel. Praying toward Israel would show that they were praying to Yahweh, the God of Israel. AT: "that they pray facing their land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **to their prayer and to their requests** - The words "prayer" and "requests" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the people are sincere as they make their requests. AT: "their requests" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
