===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 If I had decided by myself to proclaim it, \add God\add* would reward me. But I did not decide by myself to do that. I am simply doing the work that \add God\add* entrusted to me.
\v 18 So perhaps you wonder what my reward is.\f + \ft Or: are you wondering what my reward is? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add I will tell you\add*. When I proclaim the good message \add about Christ\add*, I do not ask people for financial help. It \add makes me very happy not to ask for help, and being happy is the\add* reward I get. I do not want to use the rights that I have \add when I proclaim\add* the good message.

<usfm>
\v 17 If I preach the Good News willingly and with all my heart, I have a great reward. But even if I did not preach it willingly, I would still have to do it, because that is the work that God has honored me by giving.
\v 18 So what is the reward that God gives me? It is that when I preach the Good News to people who do not support me, I offer it freely, without putting anyone under obligation to me. They simply receive the gospel, and that fact is my reward.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 For if I do this willingly, I have a reward. But if not willingly, I still have a responsibility that was entrusted to me.
\v 18 What then is my reward? That when I preach, I may offer the gospel without charge and so not take full use of my right in the gospel.
