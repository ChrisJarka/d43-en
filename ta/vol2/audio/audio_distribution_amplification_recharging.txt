//This page answers the question:// //What equipment can be used to amplify sound or recharge listening equipment?//

A tool useful for listening to audio content as a large group is the Solar Case Speaker by MegaVoice. This versatile piece of equipment can serve many purposes for a recording project, for ministry personnel working in remote locations and especially for churches and small groups.

The top of the case has dual speaker ports and a built-in solar panel that recharges the encased high-capacity lithium-ion battery. When unzipped, there is room to place a MegaVoice Envoy or mobile phone safely inside. Opening the case gives access to a 3.5mm stereo input cable that connects the speaker to an audio player. A second cable inside serves as a bi-directional charging cable. Utilizing the included adapters, an audio player or mobile device can be recharged from the case speaker battery. Likewise, a standard USB A adapter cable is included that allows the case speaker to be rapidly charged from a laptop USB charging port or other 5VDC source.

The speaker is capable of being very loud and, in an enclosed room, can provide listening coverage for dozens, perhaps even a hundred people. During the recording and editing phase, the solar case speaker can serve as a handy tool for general playback listening.
