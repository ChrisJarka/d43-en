\v 5 They all sailed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Then the disciples realized that they had forgotten to take anything to eat with them.
\v 6 At that point, Jesus said to them, "Be careful not to accept the yeast that the Pharisees and Sadducees want to give you."
\v 7 They tried to make sense out of what Jesus had told them, and they said to each other, "He must have said that because we forgot to bring anything to eat!"
\v 8 But Jesus knew what we were saying and answered us, "I am disappointed that you think it was because you forgot bring bread that I talked about the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. You believe only a little what I am able to do for you.
