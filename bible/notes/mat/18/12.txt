\v 12 What do you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* think \add you would do in the following situation\add*? If you had one hundred sheep and one of them got lost, you would surely leave the ninety-nine sheep \add that are\add* on the hill and go and search for the lost one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, would you not?
\v 13 If you found it, I affirm to you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* that you would rejoice very much. You would be happy that ninety-nine sheep did not stray away, but you would rejoice even more \add because you had found\add* the sheep that had strayed away.
\v 14 In the same way \add that the shepherd does not want one of\add* his \add sheep to stray away\add*, so \add God\add*, your Father in heaven, does not want \add even\add* one of these children to go to hell."

\v 12 What do you, would you not?
\v 13 If you found it, I affirm to you that you would rejoice very much. You would be happy that ninety-nine sheep did not stray away, but you would rejoice even more because you had found the sheep that had strayed away.
\v 14 In the same way that the shepherd does not want one of his sheep to stray away, so God, your Father in heaven, does not want even one of these children to go to hell."

\v 12 How think ye? if any man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, does he not leave the ninety and nine, and
go to the mountains, and seek that which goes astray?
\v 13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety and nine which have
not gone astray.
\v 14 Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
