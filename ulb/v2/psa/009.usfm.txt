\c 9
\d For the Chief Musician; set to Muth-labben. A Psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 I will give thanks to Jehovah with my whole heart;
\q I will show forth all your marvelous works.
\q
\v 2 I will be glad and exult in thee;
\q I will sing praise to your name, O you Most High.
\q
\v 3 When mine enemies turn back,
\q They stumble and perish at your presence.
\q
\v 4 For you have maintained my right and my cause;
\q You sit in the throne judging righteously.
\q
\v 5 You have rebuked the nations, you have destroyed the wicked;
\q You have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
\q
\v 6 The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever;
\q And the cities which you have overthrown,
\q The very remembrance of them is perished.
\q
\v 7 But Jehovah sits as king for ever:
\q He has prepared his throne for judgment;
\q
\v 8 And he will judge the world in righteousness,
\q He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness.
\q
\v 9 Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed,
\q A high tower in times of trouble;
\q
\v 10 And they that know your name will put their trust in thee;
\q For thou, Jehovah, have not forsaken them that seek thee.
\q
\v 11 Sing praises to Jehovah, who lives in Zion:
\q Declare among the people his doings.
\q
\v 12 For he that makes inquisition for blood remembers them;
\q He forgetteth not the cry of the poor.
\q
\v 13 Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah;
\q Behold my affliction which I suffer of them that hate me,
\q You that lift me up from the gates of death;
\q
\v 14 That I may show forth all your praise.
\q In the gates of the daughter of Zion
\q I will rejoice in your salvation.
\q
\v 15 The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made:
\q In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
\q
\v 16 Jehovah has made himself known, he has executed judgment:
\q The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. \qs [Higgaion.
Selah\qs*
\q
\v 17 The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol,
\q Even all the nations that forget God.
\q
\v 18 For the needy shall not always be forgotten,
\q Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.
\q
\v 19 Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail:
\q Let the nations be judged in your sight.
\q
\v 20 Put them in fear, O Jehovah:
\q Let the nations know themselves to be but men. \qs [Selah\qs*
