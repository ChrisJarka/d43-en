====== Galatia ======

===== Facts: =====

Galatia was a large region located in the east part of Asia Minor.

  * Paul addressed the letter of Galatians to churches in Galatia.
  * Where these churches were located, and when the letter was written is open to some debate.
  * The churches at Galatia were gentile Christian churches that were being influenced  by Jewish Christians to keep some of the Jewish laws.  That is the reason Paul wrote his letter, which is the Book of Galatians in the New Testament.
