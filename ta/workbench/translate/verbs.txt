This module answers the question: What are verbs and what kinds of things are associated with them? 

In order to understand this page, it would be good to read:

==== Description ====

Verbs are words that refer to an action or event or that are used in describing or identifying things. The verbs in the examples below are underlined. 

  * John __ran__.  ("Run" is an action.)
  * John __ate__ a banana.  ("Eat" is an action.)
  * John __saw__ Mark. ("See" is an event")
  * John __died.__  ("Die" is an event.)
  * John __is__ tall.  (The phrase "is tall" describes John.)
  * John __is__ my brother. (The phrase "is my brother" identifies John.)

==== Things Associated with Verbs ==== 

=== People or Things === 
A verb usually says something about someone or something. All of the example sentences above say something about John. "John" is the subject of those sentences. 

Sometimes there is another person or thing associated with the verb. In the examples below, "banana" and "Mark" are the object.
  * John __ate__ a banana.
  * John __saw__ Mark.

In some languages, the verb may be a little bit different depending on the persons or things associated with it. For example, English speakers sometimes put "s" at the end of the verb when the subject is just one person.

  * They __eat__ bananas every day. (The subject "they" is more than one person.)
  * John __eats__ bananas every day. (The subject "John" is one person.)

=== Tense or time === 

When we tell about an event, we usually tell whether it is in the past, the present, or the future. Sometimes we do this with words like "yesterday," "now," or "tomorrow."

In some languages the verb may be a little bit different depending on the time associated with it. This kind of marking on a verb is called "tense". English speakers sometimes put "ed" at the end of the verb when the event happened in the past.

  * Sometimes Mary __cooks__ meat.
  * Yesterday Mary __cooked__ meat.  (She did this in the past.)

In some languages speakers might add a word might to tell something about the time. English speakers use the word "will" when the verb refers to something in the future.

  * Tomorrow Mary __will cook__ meat. 

=== Aspect === 

When we tell about an event, we usually show whether or not we are thinking about how the event progressed over a period of time, and whether or not the event is still relevant when something else happens. This is aspect. English speakers sometimes use the verbs "is" or "has" and adds "s," "ing," or "ed" to the end of the verb.

  * Mary __cooks__ meat every day. (This tell about something Mary often does.)
  * Mary __is cooking__ the meat. (This tells about something Mary is in the process of doing right now.)
  * Mary __cooked__ the meat and John came home.  (This simply tells about something Mary did.)
  * While Mary __was cooking__ the meat, John came home. (This tells about something Mary was in the process of doing.)
  * Mary __has cooked__ the meat, and she wants us to come eat it. (This tells about something Mary did that is still relevant now.)
  * Mary __had cooked__ the meat by the time Mark got home. (This tells about something that Mary completed in the past before something else happened.)


==== Verbs and Objects ====

All sentences have a subject and a verb. In the examples below the subject is bold and the verb is underlined. The verbs in the s


  * John __kicked__ the football.

  * **The sun** __rises__ at six in the morning. 
  * **John** __runs__ fast. 
  * **John** __fell__.

Some sentences have an object
 

English grammar allows for not stating the object of the verb even if that verb can take an object; so that these sentences may also only have the SUBJECT (PARTICIPANT) and VERB (EVENT) stated. \\ Examples:

  * '//He has been **singing**  for three hours//.' The object is not stated.
  * '//He has been **singing **__hymns__  for three hours.//' "Hymns" is the object of "singing."

Note that different languages have different [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_order|orders]] for these parts of the sentences. In the examples below, the subject is first, the verb is bold, and the object is underlined. \\
 \\
In English, it is sometimes alright to leave out the object when the object is not important in the sentence.

  * He **sang **__a song__.
  * He likes to **sing**.

In some languages, a verb that needs an object must always take one, even if the object is not very important. In all of these sentences, English can leave out the object.

  * He likes to **sing**__ songs__.
  * He likes to **cook **__food__.
  * He has not **eaten **__anything__  in three days.
  * He is blind. He cannot **see **__anything__.

Sometimes you may need to include an object even if there is no object in English.
