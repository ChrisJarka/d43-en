===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now**  - "But now." This marks a new part of the story. You may translate this in a way that contrasting stories are introduced in your language.
  * **a certain man**  - Consider translating this in a way new people are introduced in a story in your language.
  * **he kept back part of the sale money**  - He was not honest in reporting the full amount of the sale to the apostles. This implied information can be made explicit: "He secretly kept back part of the sale money." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **his wife also knew it**
 - AT: "his wife also knew and agreed to do it"
  * **laid it at the apostles' feet**  - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:act:04:34|4:35]].
