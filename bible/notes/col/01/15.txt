===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 God's Son reveals perfectly what God, his Father, is like, whom no one can see. God's Son existed before and ranks above everything that God has created.
\v 16 When God created everything that is on the earth, he did it by having his Son do it. He created everything that \add people\add* can see, and also everything which is in heaven that \add people\add* cannot see. In particular, his Son created all ranks of important spirit beings. \add And he ranks above everything\add*, because God created everything by the work of his Son, and because by him all things were created \f + \ft Or:because \add God\add* created everything \f* in order that everything might praise his Son,
\v 17 and because it is his Son who existed before anything else existed, and because God sustains everything by what his Son \add does\add*.

\v 15 Jesus, the Son of God, is the perfect likeness of God, even though God is invisible and no one can see him. Jesus is the preeminent Son of all creation, which means his glory and honor is the very reason God created everything, and Jesus is the most important person to ever live. He is the only Son of God!
\v 16 For all things were created by God the Son. Everything in the sky, the sun and moon and stars, and everything on earth, and everything that we can see, and everything that we cannot see, such as angelic beings of all kinds and powers and authorities, ALL things have been created by Jesus Christ and for his own praise!
\v 17 Jesus existed before anything was ever created, and Jesus Christ holds everything in the universe together by his power.

\v 15 He is the image of the invisible God. He is the firstborn of all creation
\v 16 because by Him all things were created, those in the heavens and those on the earth, the visible and the invisible. Whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities, all things were created by him and for him.
\v 17 He is before all things, and He holds all things together.
