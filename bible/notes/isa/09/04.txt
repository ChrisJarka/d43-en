===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For the yoke of his burden, the beam across his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor** - The word "his" refers to Israel. Isaiah compares the people of Israel, burdened by sin, to oxen wearing yokes and to slaves oppressed by their rulers. 
  * **the yoke...the beam...the rod...you have shattered** - Isaiah describes the future freedom which the Lord will give to the people.  Notice that the ULB uses the past tense, but the UDB uses the future tense.  Often in prophecy events that will happen in the future are described as happening in the past. This emphasizes that the event will certainly happen.  Alternate translation: "The Lord will free the people of Judah from their burdens like a master who removes the yoke from his oxen or like a king who breaks an oppressor's rod." See: ([[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:simile]]).  Notice that the ULB uses "his," but the UDB "us" and "our" because Isaiah sees himself as belonging to the people of Israel. (See [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:inclusive]).
  * **as on the day of Midian** - "as when the Lord used Gideon, a judge in Israel, to conquer the Midianites" (See:[[en:obe:other:gideon]])
  * **every boot treading in the tumult and the garments rolled in blood will be burned** - The phrases "every boot" and "clothing covered with blood" may be metonymies for "every enemy soldier." Alternate translation: "The Lord will destroy all the enemy soldiers and their weapons of warfare" (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metonymy]] and [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metaphor]])   
  * **fuel for the fire** - The Lord's anger towards Israel's enemies is compared to a fire which destroys everything.  Alternate translation: "and used as fuel for his fire" (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metaphor]])
