====== Doublet ======

We are using the word **doublet** to refer to two words or very short phrases that mean the same thing and that are joined with the word "and." This is often used to emphasize or intensify the idea expressed by the two words. 

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Translate both words.
  * Translate only one of the words and add a word that intensifies it such as "very" or "great" or "many".
  * Use your own culture's way of emphasizing or intensifying the concept.
