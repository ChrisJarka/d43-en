\v 1 Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God out of the fishâ€™s belly.
\v 2 And he said,
\q I called by reason of mine affliction to Jehovah,
\q And he answered me;
\q Out of the belly of Sheol cried I,
\q And you heard my voice.
\q
\v 3 For you did cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas,
\q And the flood was round about me;
\q All your waves and your billows passed over me.
\q
\v 4 And I said, I am cast out from before your eyes;
\q Yet I will look again toward your holy temple.
\q
\v 5 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul;
\q The deep was round about me;
\q The weeds were wrapped about my head.
\q
\v 6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains;
\q The earth with its bars closed upon me for ever:
\q Yet have you brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.
\q
\v 7 When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah;
\q And my prayer came in to thee, into your holy temple.
\q
\v 8 They that regard lying vanities
\q Forsake their own mercy.
\q
\v 9 But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving;
\q I will pay that which I have vowed.
\q Salvation is of Jehovah.

\v 10 And Jehovah spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
