\v 20 The harvest has passed on, summer is over. But we have not been saved.

  * **General Information:** - The word "we" refers to the people of Judah. The words "I" and "my" refer to Jeremiah.

  * **The harvest has passed on** - "Harvest time is over"
  * **But we have not been saved** - Jeremiah tells what the people of Judah are saying. This can be stated in active form. AT: "But Yahweh has not saved us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **I am hurt because of the hurt of the daughter of my people. I mourn at the horrible things that have happened to her; I am dismayed** - These statements express the same idea in more than one way for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **Is there no medicine in Gilead? Is there no healer there? Why will the healing of the daughter of my people not happen?** - These questions are asked to make the point that the people of Judah have not been saved. AT: "There is medicine in Gilead, and there are healers there, so tell me why the healing of my dear people will not happen." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
