\v 25 You will burn the carved figures of their god; do not desire the silver or the gold that covers them so much that you want to take it for yourself, and you become trapped by it; for it is detestable to Yahweh your God.
\v 26 You will not bring an any disgusting thing into your house and start to worship it. You will utterly detest and abhor it, for it is set apart for destruction.
