==== "This is Yahweh's declaration": ==== 

**this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])

==== "The word of Yahweh came": ====

**New** Notes Templates for **"The word of Yahweh came to [audience … ] (saying)"**  -  
  * When writing notes, please replace "[audience]" with "me" or "Jeremiah." 
  * The ellipsis in the template represents an adverbial phrase. Don’t use the ellipsis if there is no adverbial phrase. If there is an adverbial phrase, put it into the snippet and ATs. (You can shorten the adverbial phrase by using its first and last words with an ellipsis in between.) 
  * When you write your notes, please do not end a snippet or AT with an ellipsis, and do not put any punctuation immediately before or after an ellipsis. (The templates have an ellipsis in the second AT.  After the four note templates, there is an example of how to write a note without the final ellipsis in the AT.)
  * In the template I wrote three possible ATs. Choose the two most useful ones for your verse.
  * When the audience is a pronoun, I prefer to reword it differently in the AT than I would with a name. I think that should be ok. ("gave a message to Jeremiah" vs "gave me a message")
