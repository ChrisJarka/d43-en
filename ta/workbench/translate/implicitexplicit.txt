====== Background Knowledge and Implicit Information ======


//This page answers the question: What are background knowledge, explicit information, and implicit information?// 

**Background knowledge** is whatever a speaker expects his audience to know before he speaks and gives them some kind of information. There are two types information.

  * **Explicit information** is what the speaker states directly.
  * **Implicit information** is what the speaker does not state directly because he expects his audience to be able to learn it from what he says.

==== Description ====

When someone speaks or writes, he has something specific that he wants people to know. He normally states this directly. This is **explicit information**.

The speaker assumes that his audience already knows certain things that they will think about in order to understand this information. Normally he does not tell people these things, although what he says may remind them about those things they know. This is called **background knowledge**. 

The speaker does not always directly state everything that he expects his audience to learn from what he says. Information that he expects people to learn from what he says even though he does not state it directly is **implicit information.**

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>Then a scribe came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." Jesus said to him, "Foxes __have holes__, and the birds of the sky __have nests__, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."  (Matthew 8:20 ULB)

Jesus did not say what foxes and birds use holes and nests for, because he expected that the scribe would have known that foxes sleep in holes in the ground and birds sleep in their nests. This is **background knowledge**. Jesus did not directly say here "I am the Son of Man" but, if the scribe did not already know it, then that fact would be **implicit information** because Jesus referred to himself that way. Jesus did not state explicitly that  he travelled a lot and did not have a house that he slept in every night. That is **implicit information** that the scribe could learn when Jesus said that he had nowhere to lay his head.

> Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you.  (Matthew 11:21, 22 ULB)

The people of Tyre and Sidon were very wicked, and the day of judgment is a time when God will judge every person. This is background knowledge that the people that Jesus was speaking to would have thought about in order to understand what he was saying. And even though the people he was speaking to had seen his mighty deeds, they had not repented. So they would be judged more severely than the people of Tyre and Sidon would be judged. This is implicit information that Jesus wanted them to learn from what he said. 

>Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not wash their hands when they eat__. (Matthew 15:2 ULB)

One of the traditions of the elders was a ceremony in which people would wash their hands in order to be ritually clean before eating. People thought that in order to be righteous, they had to follow all the traditions of the elders. This was implicit information that the Pharisees who were speaking to Jesus expected him to know. They were rebuking him because his disciples did not follow the traditions. This is implicit information that they wanted him to understand from what they said.
