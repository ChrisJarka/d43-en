====== Gentile ======


===== Facts: =====


A Gentile is a person who is not an Israelite. That is, a person who is not a descendant of Jacob and of his twelve sons.


    * In Scripture, Gentiles are occasionally referred to as the "uncircumcised" because the Israelites were commanded to circumcise their male children.
    * Because God chose the Israelites to be his special people, they thought of the Gentiles as outsiders.
    * Gentile could also be translated as "Non-Israelite", "Non-Jew" or "person from another nation."
