====== Capitalization ======

We are going to follow the 2011 NIV as a guide to new-style English capitalization. The reason for this is a combination of modern style and the fact that the lavish use of capitals in older Bible versions is not used in any of the other languages into which our text and notes will be translated.

Here are the general principles:

  - This style does not capitalize words such as temple, scripture, etc.
  - We are also not capitalizing divine personal pronouns such as he, you, etc.
  - Any title or proper name of a person or place will be capitalized

==== Capitalized Examples ====

  * Bible
  * Word of God (Jesus)
  * Christian
  * Festival of Unleavened Bread
  * God's Law
  * King of the Jews
  * Sabbath
  * Ten Commandments
  * Passover
  * Promised Land
  * the Book of (Bible book name)
        * Special exception for the capitalization of "Book of." When the expression clearly serves as a book title, it should be capitalized (e.g. "the Book of Psalms" or "the Book of Nehemiah"). However, if the phrase **can** be taken as a descriptor, it should be lowercase (e.g. "the Lamb's book of life," "in the book of the law," "in the book of the vision of Nahum," or "the book of the annals of the kings of Judah").
        * Specifically for the book introduction pages - the capitalization of headers should follow the same guidelines. So that a header that states: "Outline of the Book of (Bible book name)" is correct. 

==== Uncapitalized Examples ====

  * scripture
  * word of God (scripture)
  * synagogue
  * exile
  * good news (gospel)
  * gospel
  * kingdom of God
  * kingdom of Israel
  * the law of God
  * the law of Moses
  * new covenant
  * temple
  * tent of meeting
  * heaven
  * hades
  * sheol

==== Other Examples ====

  * 3 a.m.
  * 10 p.m.
  * 44 B.C. 
        * As in, "Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 B.C." Note that "B.C." is put after the year's number.
  * A.D. 29
        * As in, "Many scholars believe that Christ was crucified in A.D. 29." Note that "A.D." is put before the year's number.
