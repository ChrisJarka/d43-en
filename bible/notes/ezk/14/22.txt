\v 22 Yet, behold! A remnant will be left in her, a survivor who will go out with sons and daughters. Behold! They will go out to you, 
and you will see their ways and their actions and be comforted concerning the evil that I have sent to Jerusalem and everything 
else that I have sent against the land.
\v 23 They will comfort you, when you see their ways and their doings; so you will know that I have not done all these things that  
I have done against her in vain!'--this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration."
