====== Daniel ======

===== Facts: =====

Daniel was an Old Testament prophet who was taken captive into Babylon during Israel's captivity about 600 BC.

  * Daniel was promoted within Babylon when he correctly interpreted King Nebuchadnezzar's first dream as a revelation given by God of the future of Babylon and succeeding future kingdoms.
  * While in the Babylonian captivity Daniel was given the name Belteshazzar to reflect Babylon's gods.
  * A statute was created by Daniel's rivals to destroy Daniel that anyone bowing before any god other than the king shall be thrown into a lions' den. Predictably, Daniel bowed before God and was thrown into the lions' den, but God delivered Daniel from death or injury.
