===== Facts: =====

To be alarmed is to be very worried and frightened about something dangerous or threatening.

  * In the Old Testament Jehoshapat King of Judah was alarmed when he heard that the Moabites were planning to attack Judah.
  * In the New Testament Jesus said to not be alarmed when we hear about disasters happening in the last days.
  * The idiom "sound the alarm" means to give a warning. In ancient times as well as today, the sounding of an alarm would involve making a noise with something like a trumpet or a bell. It could also just mean telling people about the danger and having them warn others.
