<usfm> \v 2 It is as delightful as the precious oil \q2 that ran down from the high priest Aaron's head onto his beard when Moses anointed him, \q2 that ran down onto the collar of his robes. \q1 \v 3 Gathering together in peace is as delightful as the dew that falls on Mount Hermon \q2 and the dew that falls on Mount Zion. \q1 Yahweh has promised to bless his people there in Jerusalem \q2 by making their nation last forever. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \q \v 2 It is like the precious oil on the head \q that flowed down the beard, \q Aaronâ€™s beard, \q that flowed down his garments. \q \v 3 It iike the dew of Hermon, \q which comes down upon the mountains of Zion. \q For there Yahweh decreed the blessing, \q life forevermore. </usfm>

~~DISCUSSION~~{{tag>draft book5}}

typos: v. 3 is missing the verb "is" and "like" is misspelled "iike"

"decree" is so much stronger than "promise"
