===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **It happened that**  - This phrase is used here to mark where the action starts. It starts with Jesus approaching them. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here. 
    * **Jesus himself** - The word "himself" focusses on Jesus and the surprise of Jesus actually appearing to them. So far the women had seen the angels, but no one had seen Jesus.
    * **Their eyes were restrained**  - God did not allow them (see  to see and so recognize Jesus. [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy]])
