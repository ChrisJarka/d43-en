\c 31
\p
\v 1 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and rely on horses, and trust in many chariots and in strong
horsemen. But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel nor seek Yahweh!
\v 2 Yet he also is wise, and he will bring disaster and will not retract his words. But he will arise against the evil nation and against the nation that helps those who commit sin.
