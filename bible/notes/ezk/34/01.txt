\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 2 "Son of man, speak my message against the leaders of Israel. They should be taking care of my people, like shepherds take care of their flocks. Say to them that this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have to tell them: 'You shepherds of Israel, I will make terrible things happen to you, because you take care only of yourselves. You should certainly take care of my sheep.
\v 3 But you are like shepherds who eat the fat sheep, who slaughter the best animals for their wool. You are not real shepherds at all.
