\p
\v 1 And I said, Hear, I pray you, you heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know justice?
\v 2 you who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
\v 3 who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as
for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
