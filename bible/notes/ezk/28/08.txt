\v 8 They will send you down to the pit and you will die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas!
\v 9 Will you truly say, “I am a god” to the face of the one who slays you? Yet you are a man and not God, in the hand of the one who pierces you!
\v 10 You will die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers, for I have declared it!’—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”
