====== 1 Thessalonians 04 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Sexual immorality ==
Different cultures have different standard of sexual morality. These different cultural standards may pose difficulty in translation. 

== Dying before the return of Christ ==
In the early church, people wondered what would happen if a person died before the return of Christ. They may have worried those dying before the return of Christ would not get to partake of the kingdom of God. 

== "Caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air" ==
Many scholars believe this passage refers to an event known as the "rapture." This is a time when Jesus calls those who believe in him to himself. The timing of this hypothetical event is the matter of much speculation.
