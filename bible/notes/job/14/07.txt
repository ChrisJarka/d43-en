\v 7 For there is hope of a tree,
\q If it be cut down, that it will sprout again,
\q And that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
\q
\v 8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,
\q And the stock thereof die in the ground;
\q
\v 9 Yet through the scent of water it will bud,
\q And put forth boughs like a plant.
