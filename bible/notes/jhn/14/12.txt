\v 12 I promise on oath this is true: Whoever trusts in me, will also do the words I do. And even greater works will he do because I am going to be with the Father.
\v13 Whatever you ask in my name, that I will do. This is how the Father is honored and known by what the Son does.
\v 14 If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.
