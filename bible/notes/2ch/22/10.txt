\v 10 Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the
house of Judah.
\v 11 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the kingâ€™s sons
that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of
Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she killed him not.
\v 12 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.
