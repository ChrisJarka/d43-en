\v 15 The men who were governors before I became the governor had burdened the people by requiring them to pay a lot of taxes.

\v 14 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to
the two and thirties year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread
of the governor.
\v 15 But the former governors that were before me were chargeable to the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides
forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
