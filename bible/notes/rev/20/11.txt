\v 11 then I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.
\v 12 I saw the dead, the great, and the small, who stood before the throne. Books were opened and another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to the records in the books, according to their actions.
