\v 22 And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz.
\v 23 For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which struck him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped
them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
