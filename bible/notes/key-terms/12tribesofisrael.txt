====== twelve tribes of Israel ======

===== Definition: =====

The twelve tribes of Israel refer to the descendants of Jacob, who were also collectively known as "Israel".

  * Jacob was the grandson of Abraham, and God changed Jacob's name to Israel. Both the name "Jacob" and the name "Israel" refer to the same person.
  * The Tribes are as follows: Levi (The Levis were a tribe of priests. The Levis inherited no land in Canaan.), Reuben, Simeon, Judah, Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Benjamin, and Joseph. Joseph received a double inheritance of land in Canaan, which was passed on this his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh.
  * It should be noted that there are several times in the Bible that the list of tribes is altered slightly by removing Levi and Joseph and adding Josephâ€™s two sons Ephraim and Manasseh, but the list above is generally accepted as the tribal list.
