===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **me**  - The word "me" refers to Ezekiel.
  * **What do you mean...‘Fathers eat sour grapes, and the children’s teeth made blunt’?**  -  God asks this question in order to express that the people's proverb is not true.  By saying that a father eating sour grapes causes a child's teeth to become blunt they are saying that a father has bad habits and his children suffer because of it.  AT: "It is not true that children are punished by God because of their parents' wicked deeds." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **land of Israel**  - This refers to the people of Israel. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
