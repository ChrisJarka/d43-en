\v 19 One of Sennacherib's important officials told them to take this message to Hezekiah:
\p "This is what the king of Assyria, the great king, says: 'What are you trusting in \add to rescue you\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\v 20 You say that you have weapons to fight us and some country promises \add to help you\add*, \add and that will enable you to defeat us\add*, but that is only talk \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. Who do you think will help you to rebel against my \add soldiers from Assyria\add*?
\v 21 Listen to me! You are relying on the \add army of\add* Egypt. But that is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* using a broken reed for a walking stick on which you could lean. But it would pierce the hand of anyone who would lean on it! That is what the king of Egypt would be like for anyone who relied on him \add for help\add*.

\v 19 And Rabshakeh said to them, Say you now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is
this wherein you trustest?
\v 20 You say (but they are but vain words), There is counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do you
trust, that you have rebelled against me?
\v 21 Now, behold, you trust upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into
his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.
