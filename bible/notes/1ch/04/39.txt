\v 39 They went outside of Gedor \add town\add* on the east side of the valley to look for pastureland for their flocks of sheep.
\v 40 They found good pastureland with plenty of grass. The place was peaceful and quiet.
\p Previously the descendants of \add Noah's son\add* Ham had lived there.
\v 41 But while Hezekiah was the king of Judah, those leaders of the tribe of Simeon came to Gedor and fought against the descendants of Ham and destroyed their tents. They also fought against the descendants of Meun who were living there and they killed all of them. So now there are no descendants of Meun living there. The descendants of Simeon started to live there, because there was good pastureland there for their sheep.

\v 39 And they went to the entrance of Gedor, even to the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.
\v 40 And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for they that lived there aforetime
were of Ham.
\v 41 And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and struck their tents, and the Meunim that were
found there, and destroyed them utterly to this day, and lived in their stead; because there was pasture there for their
flocks.
