\v 19 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out?
\v 20 And he says to them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard
seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to
you.
\v 21 \f + Many authorities, some ancient, insert v. 21. \fqa But this kind goes not out save by prayer and
fasting.\f*
