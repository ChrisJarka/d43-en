\v 13 \add All this that I am saying about John is confirmed by the fact that\add* all the men who wrote the Scriptures \f + \ft metonymy, synecdoche \f* foretold \add about God ruling people's lives\add*, until John \add the Baptizer came\add*.
\v 14 \add Even though most of you are unwilling to believe what I am saying, I will tell this truth to\add* anyone who is willing to believe \add it:\add* John is \add the man who is like\add* Elijah \f + \ft metaphor \f*. He is the one who \add one of the prophets said\add* would come \add in order to prepare the people to welcome the Messiah\add*.

\v 13 Everything that I am saying about John is just what you can read in what the prophets have written and what the law has been saying until the time of John the Baptizer.
\v 14 Not only that, but if you are willing to try to understand this, I will tell you that John is in fact the second Elijah, the prophet who was to come in the future.
\v 15 If you want to understand this, you must think carefully about what I have just said.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues talking to the crowd.

  * **And if you **- "you" here refers to the people in the crowd.
  * **this is Elijah **- "this" refers to John the Baptist; this phrase is a metonym saying that John the Baptist corresponds to the Elijah prophesied in Malachi 4:5, but it is not saying that John the Baptist is the actual person of Elijah. (See: Metonym)
