\v 15 Listen and give ear! Do not be arrogant, for Yahweh had declared!
\q
\v 16 Give glory to Yahweh your God before he brings darkness,
\q Even before he causes your feet to stumble upon the twilight mountains!
\q For you hope for light but he makes it a deep gloom! He makes it a dark cloud.
\q
\v 17 So if you will not listen, my soul will weep in secret places because of your pride;
\q And my eye will surely weep and flow with tears, for the flock of Yahweh is taken captive!
