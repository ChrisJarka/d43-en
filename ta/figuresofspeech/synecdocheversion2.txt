====== Synecdoche [siˈnekdəkē] ======


In synecdoche something is not called not by its own name, but by the name of a part of that thing or by the name of something that the thing is a part of.

 When something is called by one of its parts, it is not a random part that is chosen. It is usually a part that is significant to what is being said about the thing.

"He bought a new __set of wheels__" means that he bought a new __car__. A set of wheels is a part of a car - a very important part for giving him the freedom to easily go where he wants. \\ 

"She washed the __dishes__" means that she washed the __kitchen utensils__ including any pots, pans, cups, forks, and so on. Dishes are just one kind of kitchen utensil, but it is a significant kind because it is what the food is served on.

When something is called by some bigger thing that it is a part of, it is usually because there is something significant about that bigger thing. ===

"__The company__ announced that it was bankrupt" means that _a representative of the company's leadership__ announced that it was bankrupt. A representative is just one of the people in the company.\\

A voice of one calling in the desert Luke 3:4b 

A prophet wrote about another prophet who would come and preach in the desert. He referred to him as a voice, the part of him that would be so significant to his work.

Oh no. I don't think this is really synecdoche. The man isn't being called a voice. He's called "one" or "one calling in the desert".
