\v 17 Then Jesus said to him, "Simon, son of Jonah, God is pleased with you. What you just said--no human has revealed this to you. Instead, it was my Father who lives in heaven who has revealed this to you.
\v 18 I will also tell you this: You are Peter, which means 'rock.' You will be the support for the group of those who believe in me, like a large rock supports a great building. And even death will not be strong enough to destroy it."

you, but my Father who is in heaven.
\v 18 I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; the gates of Hades will 
not prevail against it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * This is Jesus' reply to Peter.
  * **for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you **- "no human has revealed this to you" (See: Synecdoche and Metonymy)
  * **upon this rock **- Rock is a personification for Peter, which is also the meaning of Peter's name. This may be a reference to Peter's being the first public witness and support for those who believe in Jesus. It may also refer to Peter's confession that Christ is from God. It could also mean that though Peter's name meant rock, Jesus is the rock upon which he would build his church. (See: Personification)
  * **gates of Hades **- This is a metaphor referring to the powers of death led by Satan himself. (See: Metaphor)
