=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

**Hannah's song of praise to God**

God protects the weak and strengthens them. He humbles the rich and provides for the poor and defeats his enemies.


**Eli's Sons**


The Chief Priest had two sons. They continually sinned and did not honor God and disobeyed how a priest should do. Eli scolded them but they did not listen. A prophet warned Eli that God would stop his family from being priests and his sons would die both on the same day. But Samuel was growing up and serving God.  


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

This chapter has very many figures of speech because the first part of the chapter is a song and has synecdoche, metonymy and metaphors in it. And the last part of the chapter is a prophecy and has very many idioms and rhetorical questions. 

**Synecdoche**

“My heart”, My horn”, “my mouth” all are [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]s  meaning “I”. 


**Metonymy**


“the feet of his faithful people” meaning what they are doing or going is a[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]], as is "the ends of the earth" meaning the people living in the ends of the earth. 


**Metaphor**

“Rock” meaning protection, “the bows of the might men are broken” meaning military might is defeated, "the horn of his anointed" meaning the power of the one he has chosen to be king are all [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]s.

**Idiom**

The prophecy against Eli uses very many [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]s: "before Yahweh" meaning against Yahweh. "a man of God" meaning someone who spoke messages from God," "house of your ancestors" meaning your linage, "walk before me" meaning serve me, you father's house" meaning your descendants, "in my heart and in my soul" meaning what I want, "cut off from my alter" meaning not allow to be my priests, "a piece of bread" meaning some food. 


**Rhetorical questions**

God use three [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]s to scold Eli. "Did I not reveal myself to the house of your ancestor ...?, "Why do you scorn my offerings...?" and "Why do you favor your sons above me ... ?
