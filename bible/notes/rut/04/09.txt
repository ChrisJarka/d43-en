===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **raise up the name of the dead**  - Any sons Ruth bore would be considered Elimelech's sons (see verse 17).. See Gen 48:5, where Jacob adopts Joseph's two oldest sons to replace the two evil sons Jacob effectively disowned.
  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **from the gate of his place**  - People went in and out of walled towns through gates that were often shut at night. Near the gates were open spaces where people could gather to engage in discussions where witnesses were required, for example, to settle disputes or other important legal matters. Boaz is saying here that any son Ruth bore Boaz would keep Mahlon's legal standing alive. "His place" refers to Bethlehem.
