\v 10 And in this matter I give you advice: since this benefits you, you not only started to do something a year ago when you began this, but you desired to do it.
\v 11 So now also finish doing it. So just as there was an eagerness and desire to do it then, you also may bring it to completion, as you are able.
\v 12 For if an eagerness to complete this work exists, it is a good thing, based on what a person has, not on what he does not have.
