\p Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.
\v 9 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of
our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.
\v 10 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak you not a word of bringing the king
back?
