\v 19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the
kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 20 For I say to you, that except your righteousness shall exceed
the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
