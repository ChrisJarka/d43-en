\v 3 and there was a widow in that city; and she came often to him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.
\v 4 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
\v 5 yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will avenge her, unless she wear me out by her continual coming."
