<usfm>
\v 9 The words 'he ascended' certainly imply that Christ had also previously descended to the earth from heaven, as if like the Psalmist who described the king who descended his mountain city to wage war, conquer, and ascend back to the mountaintop and give the gifts of victory to his people.
\v 10 Christ, who descended to earth to conquer evil, is also the one who was crucified for our sins, came back to life, and ascended to the most exalted position in heaven, in order that he might show his power throughout the universe.

\v 9 This statement, "He ascended," must mean that he also descended into the lower areas of the earth?
