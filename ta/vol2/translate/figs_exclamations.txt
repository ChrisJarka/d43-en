==== Description ====

Exclamations are words or sentences that show strong feeling. In the ULB and UDB, they usually have an exclamation mark (!) at the end. The meaning of the sentences shows us that the speakers were terribly afraid. 

>Save us, Lord; we are about to die! (Matthew 8:25 ULB)

**Reason this is a translation issue**: Languages have different ways of showing that a sentence shows strong emotion.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

Some exclamations have a word that shows feeling. The sentences below have "Oh" and "Ah." The word "oh" here shows the speaker's amazement. 

>__Oh__, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

The word "Ah" below shows that Gideon was very frightened. 
>Gideon understood that this was the angel of Yahweh. Gideon said, "__Ah__, Lord Yahweh! For I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face!" (Judges 6:22 ULB)

Some exclamations start with a question word such as "how" or "why," even though they are not questions. The sentence below shows that the speaker is amazed at how unsearchable God's judgments are.

>__How__ unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

Some exclamations in the Bible do not have a main verb. The exclamation below shows that the speaker is disgusted with the person he is speaking to.

>You worthless person! (Matthew 5:22 ULB)

==== Translation Strategies ====

  - If an exclamation in your language needs a verb, add one. Often a good verb is "is" or "are."
  - Use a word word from your language that shows the strong feeling. 
  - Translate the exclamation word with a sentence that shows the feeling.
  - Use a word that emphasizes the part of the sentence that brings about the strong feeling.
