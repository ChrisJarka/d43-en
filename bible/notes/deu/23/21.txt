\v 21 When you shall vow a vow to Jehovah your God, you shall not be slack to pay it: for Jehovah your God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.
\v 22 But if you shall forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.
\v 23 That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according as you have vowed to Jehovah your God, a freewill-offering, which you have promised with your mouth.
