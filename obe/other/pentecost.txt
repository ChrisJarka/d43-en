====== Pentecost, Festival of Weeks ======

===== Facts: =====

The "Festival of Weeks" was a festival that took place fifty days after Passover and the Festival of Firstfruits. In New Testament times it was referred to as "Pentecost," which was a Greek word that has "fifty" as part of its meaning.

  * The name "Festival of Weeks" came from the fact that this festival marked the completion of seven weeks of harvest which began at the Feast of Firstfruits, around the time of the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
  * The Festival of Weeks was held to celebrate the end of the wheat grain harvest. It was also known as the "Festival of Harvest."
  * In the New Testament, the Day of Pentecost is especially important because it was on this day that God poured out the Holy Spirit on Jesus' followers after Jesus had risen from the dead and gone back to heaven.
  * In modern times, the Day of Pentecost and Festival of Weeks are also a time to celebrate God giving the Israelites the Ten Commandments on tablets of stone.
