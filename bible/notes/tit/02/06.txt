===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 And concerning the younger men, teach them, too. Tell them to control themselves well.
\v 7 As for you,Titus, my son, always show others people how to do good deeds;  show them that you teach the believers honestly what is true and good and about God.
\v 8 Teach people in a way that no one can criticize, so that if anybody wants to stop you, other people will shame him because he has nothing bad to say about us. 
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 In the same way, call the younger men to be sensible.
\v 7 In all things present yourself as a model of good works, and when you teach, be a model of dignity and make sure that what you teach is pure and right.
\v 8 Speak words that do not need to be corrected but that would bring shame upon someone if he tried to oppose you, because there is nothing evil to say about us.
