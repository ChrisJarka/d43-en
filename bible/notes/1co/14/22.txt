\v 22 If we speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that we have not learned\add*, unbelievers \add who are there will realize that the Spirit of God is truly among us\add*. That will warn them \add that they need to fear God\add*. But believers do not \add need such a warning\add*.
\v 23 Suppose during the worship service everyone started to speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add*. If unbelievers or people who do not know \add about the abilities that God's Spirit gives to believers\add* come in \add and hear that\add*, they will surely think that you are crazy.\f + \ft Or: will they not think that you are crazy? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 22 Therefore, speaking in tongues, that lanuage given by the Spirit, is a sign, but it is not for Christians. It is a miraculous sign for those who are not Christians and who are outsiders who come into the worshiping assembly of the church. But the gift of prophesing, teaching and proclaiming the word of God is a sign of the Spirit's gift at work, and unbelievers may not understand, but the Christians will be blessed and helped when that gift is used. They will be built up by prophesy and the unbelievers will understand that something amazing is happening when they hear the tongues, but that is all.
\v 23 You can seen how confusing it would be if everyone had a tongue and the whole church cried on in different languages all together. Anyone who tried to make sense of it would think you were all insane.

\v 22 Therefore tongues are a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers. But prophesying is for a sign, not for unbelievers, but for believers.
\v 23 If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders and unbelievers come in, would they not say that you are insane?
