\v 12 Therefore, my fellow believers, we must live as the Spirit directs us. What we do not have to do is live as our old evil heart wants us to.
\v 13 If you do what your old evil heart wants, you will surely not live forever with God. But if you allow the Spirit to stop you doing those things, then you will live forever.

\v 12 So then, brothers, we are debtors, but not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.
\v 13 For if you live according to the flesh, you are about to die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the body's actions, you will live.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **brothers** - "fellow believers"
  * **we are debtors** â€“ "we do have a debt." A debtor is someone who must pay back what he owes to someone. Here Paul uses the word "debtor" to refer to someone who is obligated to obey someone else. Alternate translation: "we have an obligation."
  * **but not to the flesh to live according to the flesh** - "but it is not to obey our sinful desires"
  * **For if you live according to the flesh** - "Because if you live only to please your sinful desires"
  * **you are about to die** - "you will certainly die spiritually"
  * **but if by the Spirit you put to death the body's actions, you will live** - This can be translated as a new sentence: "But if by the power of the Holy Spirit you to obeying your sinful desires, you will receive eternal life."
