====== 1 Corinthians 04 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the last line of 4:6, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.  

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Do not judge between Gods workers.  Paul contrasts the Corinthian’s pride in contrast to the humbleness of the apostles. The Corinthian believers have no reason to be proud because all that they have and are is a gift from God. So Paul is sending Timothy to them to get them to do the right things again. Then Paul himself hopes to come later. He may need to discipline them.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

Metaphor [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]:  Apostles as servants. He speaks of a victory parade where the apostles are the prisoners who will be killed. He uses a rod to stand for punishment. He is their father because he started the church. 
Irony [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_irony]]: Paul is using irony to shame the pride of the Corinthians.  The Corinthian believers are reigning but the apostles are suffering.


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

"Do not go beyond what is written."  means “Do only what the rules written in the Scriptures give you permission to do.”
