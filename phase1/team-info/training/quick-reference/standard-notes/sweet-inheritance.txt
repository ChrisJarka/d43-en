====== Inheritance ======

===== Definition: =====

God spoke of being the Levite's inheritance. I don't know how much this idea comes up. But here's a note to give an idea of how to deal with it.

===== Standard Notes: =====

An example from [[:en:bible:notes:num:18:19|Numbers 18:19]]
  * **I am your share and inheritance** - God speaks of the great honor that Aaron and his descendants will have by serving him as priests as if God were something that they will inherit. AT: "Instead, I am what you will have" or "Instead, I will allow you to serve me and I will provide for you through that service" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
