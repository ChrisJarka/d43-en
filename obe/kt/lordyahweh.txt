====== Lord Yahweh ======

===== Facts: =====

Many times in the Old Testament, the names "Lord" and "Yahweh" are used together to refer to God. The term "Lord" is a title and "Yahweh" is God's personal name.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * If you use some form of "Yahweh" for his personal name, you can simply put "Lord" with it.
  * Some languages put titles after the name, so consider what is natural in the project language: should the title "Lord" come before or after "Yahweh"?
  * If the translation renders "Yahweh" as "Lord" or "LORD," it is best to render "Lord Yahweh" as a phrase such as "Lord God" or "God who is the Lord."
  * This term should not be rendered as "Lord LORD" because readers may not notice the difference in letter size that has traditionally been used to distinguish these.
