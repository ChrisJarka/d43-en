====== Phase 2 Issues ======

This is a list of general issues that we want to deal with in Phase 2. This list might get long. Let's list the issues in alphabetical order.

  * **Doublets** - Do we really want to encourage translators to simply use one of them? How do we decide when that is acceptable or when too much information would be lost?

  * **Symbolic acts** - Do we want a standard note format for these? Sometimes only they symbolic act is mentioned. They're not just idioms, but I don't think they're simply metonymy either.
      * **will shake his fist at them** - "will threaten them"??

  * **tA Links** - We have not been putting the same tA links on multiple notes in a chunk, but when the issue comes up a second time in a chunk, how do we indicate that a second or third note phrase has that issue? See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:10:26]] where there are three notes that involve metonymy.

  * **Tense in prophecy** - What do we do when English versions translate it with the past tense, but it refers to things in the future?
