====== Genesis 35:6-8 ======

<usfm>
\v 6 Jacob and all those who were with him came to Luz, which is now called Bethel, in Canaan land.
\v 7 There he built an altar. He named the place El-Bethel, which means 'God of Bethel,' because it was there that God revealed himself to Jacob when he was fleeing from his older brother Esau.
\p
\v 8 Deborah, who had taken care of Isaac's wife Rebekah when Rebekah was a small girl, was now very old. She died and was buried under an oak tree south of Bethel. So they named that place Allon-Bacuth, which means 'oak of weeping.'

\v 6 So Jacob arrived at Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.
\v 7 He built an altar there and called the place Elbethel, because there God had revealed himself to him, when he was fleeing from his brother.
\v 8 Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died. She was buried down from Bethel under the oak, so it was called Allonbacuth (Oak of weeping).
