\v 28 Then king David answered and said, Call to me Bath-sheba. And she came into the kingâ€™s presence, and stood before the
king.
\v 29 And the king sware, and said, As Jehovah liveth, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
\v 30 verily as I sware to you by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he
shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day.
\v 31 Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live
for ever.
