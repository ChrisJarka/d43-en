Q? What did Yehweh command them to do and what were they not to do?

A. They were to pass through the border of their brothers, descendants of Esau,  who lived in Seir  - who would be afraid of them. Yahweh told them not to fight for he would not give them any of their land; for Yahweh had given Mount Seir to Easu as a possession.  [2:4-5]
