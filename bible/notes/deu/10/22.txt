===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **went down into - ** This can also be translated as “went south into.”
  * **seventy persons**  - 70. The amount of people that entered Egypt from the people/family of Jacob/Israel during the time Joseph was there. See Exodus 1:5.
  * **as many as the stars of the heavens**  - Moses is quoting what Yahweh told Abraham in Genesis 22:17, "I will greatly multiply your descendents as the stars of the heavens." God compared Abraham's descendants to the stars. Just as people cannot count the huge number of stars, so there would be so many of Abraham's descendants that people would not be able to count them. Alternate translation: “beyond what you can count.” (See: Simile)
