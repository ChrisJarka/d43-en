\v 36 Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the
parable of the tares of the field.
\v 37 And he answered and said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;
\v 38 and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil
one;
\v 39 and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.
