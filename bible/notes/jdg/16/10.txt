\v 10 Delilah said to Samson, “See, you have mocked me and told me lies. Now tell me, I beg you, how you
might be tied up.”
\v 11 He said to her, “If they merely tie me up with new ropes with which no work has ever been done, I will become weak and be as any other man.”
\v 12 So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up with them. Then she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson.” The men lying in wait were in the inner room. But Samson broke the ropes off his arms like a thread.
