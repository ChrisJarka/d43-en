===== Synonyms and Equivalent Phrases =====

==== Description =====

There are times that the notes provide a translation suggestion that can replace the word or phrases in the ULB. These replacements can fit into the sentence without changing the meaning of the sentence.  These are synonyms and equivalent phrases and are written in double-quotes. These mean the same as the text in the ULB. 

==== Translation Notes Examples ====
> 'Make ready __the way__ of the Lord, (Luke 3:4 ULB)

  * **the way**  - "the path" or "the road"
In this example, the words "the path" or the words "the road" can replace the words "the way" in the ULB. You decide if it is natural to say path or road in your language.
> whoever has food should __do likewise__." (Luke 3:10 ULB)

  * **do likewise**  - "do the same thing." 
In this example, the words "do the same thing" can replace the words "do likewise" in the ULB. You, as the translator, decide what is the natural for your language.

==== Translation Principles ====  
  * Use words that are already part of your language if possible.
  * Keep expressions short if possible.
  * Represent God's commands and historical facts accurately.
 
==== Translation Strategies ====

  - Keep the meaning of the passage in all translations.
