====== 2 Corinthians 11:3-4 ======

\v 3 However, just like \add Satan, when he\add* cunningly \add appeared as a\add* snake, deceived Eve's thinking \add and caused her to disobey the Lord God\add*, I am concerned that \add those teachers\add* will cause you to think wrongly so that you will no longer \add be faithful to\add* Christ alone.
\v 4 \add I say that\add* because some people have come among you who are teaching \add their own thoughts about\add* Jesus. They \add are saying about him\add* things that are \add entirely\add* different from what I taught you. \add They are urging\add* you to receive a \add powerful\add* spirit who \add would come to live inside of you\add*, but it is not the same \add Spirit\add* that you received \add from God when you believed in Christ\add*. They preach \add what they call\add* a good message, and you accept \add their message, even though it is not the same as the good message about Christ that you heard from me. And\add* you have gladly accepted them and their message!

\v 3 But as I think about you, I became afraid that you were being deceived, as Eve was deceived by the craftiness of the devil, and that the evil one was enticing you to leave the one who loves you, and abandon your vows and betray your pure love for Christ.
\v 4 If you hear a preacher declare there is another Jesus, one who is different from the one we proclaimed to you, or if he offers a different spirit than the Spirit that God gave you, or if he tells you about another good news that is different from the Good News God gave to you—you had such open minds that you could not see the difference between what that preacher told you and what we proclaimed.

\v 3 But I am afraid that somehow—as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness—your thoughts might be led astray away from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
\v 4 For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we preached, or if you receive a different spirit than what you received, or a different gospel than the one you received, you tolerate it well enough!
