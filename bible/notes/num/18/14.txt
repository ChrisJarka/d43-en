\v 14 Everything devoted in Israel to me will be yours.
\v 15 Everything that opens the womb, all the firstborn which the people offer to Yahweh, both of man and animal, will be yours. Nevertheless the people must surely redeem the firstborn son, and they must redeem the firstborn male of unclean animals.
\v 16 Those that are to be redeemed by the people must be bought back after becoming a month old. Then the people may buy them back according to your estimation, for five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (which weighs twenty gerahs).
