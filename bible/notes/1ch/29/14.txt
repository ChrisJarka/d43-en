\v 14 But I and my people are not really able to give anything to you,
\q2 because everything that we have comes from you;
\q2 the things that we have given to you are only the things that we have received from you.
\q1
\v 15 You know that we are like foreigners and strangers to you, as our ancestors were.
\q2 Our years here on earth are like a shadow that disappears quickly;
\q2 we know that there is nothing that can enable us to escape dying.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly these things? Indeed, all things come from you, and we have simply given back to you what is yours.
\v 15 For we are strangers and travelers before you, as all our ancestors were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope of remaining on earth.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - David continues his prayer of praise to Yahweh.

  * **But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly these things?** - David uses this rhetorical question to express that he and his people deserve no praise for giving anything to God. AT: "My people and I should definitely offer these things to you willingly!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **we are strangers and travelers before you** - This speaks of people's lives being short as if they were travelers only here on earth for a short time. AT: "For our lives are short and we are like strangers and travelers who pass before you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Our days on the earth are like a shadow** - This speaks of people's lives being short as if they were a shadow that is only visible for a short time. A person's lifetime is represented by his "days." AT: "Our time here on earth are like a shadow that disappears quickly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
