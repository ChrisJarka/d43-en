\v 21 How long will I see the standard? Will I hear the sound of the horn?
\v 22 For the foolishness of my peopleâ€”they do not know me. They are idiotic people and they have no understanding. They have skill at evil, but do not know to do good.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How long will I see the standard? Will I hear the sound of the horn?** - Jeremiah uses these questions to show his distress about seeing the battle flag and hearing the sound of the horn for such a long time. He wishes that the battle would end soon. It can be stated as an exclamation. "Oh, how I wish that the battle would end, and the flag would be lowered, and the sound of the army's horn would stop" [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the standard** - "the battle flag"
  * **the sound of the horn** - Someone would blow the horn as a signal for battle.
  * **For the foolishness of my people ... do not know to do good** - It can be stated clearly that Yahweh says this. This is probably his reply to Jeremiah, telling why the battle is still happening. AT: "Yahweh replied. "It is because of the foolishness of my people ... do not know to do good'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **idiotic people** - "stupid people"
