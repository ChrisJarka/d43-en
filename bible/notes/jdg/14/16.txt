\v 16 So Samson's wife came to him, crying, and said to him, "You do not really love me. You hate me! You have told a riddle to my friends, but you have not told me the meaning of the riddle!"
\p He replied, "I have not told the meaning of the riddle even to my mother and father, so why should I tell it to you?"
\v 17 She continued to cry every time she was with him, all during the rest of the celebration. Finally, on the seventh day, because she continued to nag him, he told her the meaning of the riddle. Then she told it to the young men.

\v 16 And Samsonâ€™s wife wept before him, and said, You do but hate me, and love me not: you have put forth a riddle to
the children of my people, and have not told it me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother,
and shall I tell thee?
\v 17 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told
her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
