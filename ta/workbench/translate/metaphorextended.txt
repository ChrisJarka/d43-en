==== Description ====

An extended metaphor is one that is used in more than a sentence. It might be used in a paragraph or in several lines of poetry. 

 
=== Reasons this is a translation issue  ===
  * People may not be familiar with the things that are used as images. 

=== Translation Principles  ===
  * Make the meaning of a metaphor as clear to the target audience as it was to the original audience.
  * Do not make the meaning of a metaphor more clear to the target audience than it was to the original audience.
  * You may need to find some way of translating the images so that people can understand them.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the __clay__. You are our __potter__; and we all are the work of your hand. (Isaiah 64:8 ULB)

The example above has two metaphors. The topics are "we" and "you" and the images are "clay and "potter." Just as a potter takes clay and forms a jar or dish out of it, God makes us into what he wants us to be.



==== Translation Strategies ====
If people would understand the metaphor in the same way that the original readers would have understood it, consider using it. If not, here are some other strategies.

  - If the target audience would think that the images should be understood literally, change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding "like" or "as."
  - If the target audience would not know the **image**, see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] for ideas on how to translate that image.
  - If the target audience would not use that **image** for that meaning use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times.
