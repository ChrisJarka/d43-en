==== God is one being who exists as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit ====

1. **The Bible teaches that there is only one God.**\\ 
>"Yahweh, he is God; there is __no other God__!" (I Kings 8:60 ULB)

>"Jesus said,... This is everlasting life: that they should know you, __the only true God__." (John 17:3 ULB)\\ 
(See also: Deuteronomy 4:35, Ephesians 4:5-6, 1 Timothy 2:5, James 2:19)

2. **The Old Testament begins to reveal God's three Persons.**\\ 
>"__God__ created the heavens... __The Spirit of God__ was moving... 'Let __us__ make man in __our__ image.' " (Genesis 1:1-2 ULB)\\ 

>"about the __Son__ he says, 'Your throne, __God__, is forever... __God__, __your God__...' " (Hebrews 1:8-9 ULB quoting Psalm 45:6-7 ULB)

3. **The Church has always found it impossible to state what the New Testament says about God without affirming that He exists in three distinct Persons: The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.**\\
>"Jesus said, '...Baptize them into the name of __the Father__, of __the Son__, and of __the Holy Spirit__.' " (Matthew 28:19 ULB)\\

>"God sent his __Son__, born of a woman,... God sent the __Spirit__ of his Son into our hearts, who calls, 'Abba, __Father__.' " (Galatians 4:4-6 ULB)\\
(See also: John 14:16-17, 1 Peter 1:2)

Each Person of God is fully God, but also distinct. All three Persons can appear separately at the same time.
>"After he was baptized, __Jesus__ came up... from the water... He saw the __Spirit__ of God coming down..., and a __voice__ [the Father's] came out... saying, 'This is my Beloved __Son__...' " (Matthew 3:16-17 ULB)
God the Son is baptized while God the Spirit comes down and God the Father speaks from heaven.
