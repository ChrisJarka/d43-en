====== In his eyes/sight ======

===== Description =====

Expressions such as "in his eyes," "in his sight" or "before him" sometimes simply mean that someone saw something. But they can also be used metaphorically to mean that someone evaluated something or was ready to evaluate it.

Usually the person referred to is God, ("in Yahweh's sight"), but sometimes it is other people (i.e. Jacob saying to Esau "so that I may find favor in your sight." in Gen 32:5)

===== Standard Notes =====




Note: These are samples.  You will need to adjust the details to fit the text.\\ 
 

=== Simply Seeing === 
When it simply means that someone saw it, a note like this may be adequate.
  * **in their sight** - The abstract noun "sight" can be expressed with the verb "see". AT: "and they saw it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])

<code>

</code>


=== Metaphor for Evaluation === 
When something is done in people's sight, and it refers to their judgment or opinion, I would feel free to use the word "opinion." I do not feel comfortable using the word "opinion" to refer to God's evaluation.

  * **in the sight of Yahweh** - The sight of Yahweh represents his judgment or evaluation. AT: "as Yahweh judged" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

</code>

  * **in your sight** - Here sight represents judgment or evaluation. AT: "in your judgment" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

</code>

=== Longer Snippets === 

We can also use longer snippets to make it easier to move ideas around more in the AT, as in the second AT for these notes.

  * **what was evil in the sight of Yahweh** - The sight of Yahweh represents Yahweh's judgment or evaluation. AT: "what was evil in Yahweh's judgment" or "what Yahweh considers to be evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

<code>
  * **what was evil in the sight of Yahweh** - The sight of Yahweh represents Yahweh's judgment or evaluation. AT: "what was evil in Yahweh's judgment" or "what Yahweh considers to be evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
</code>

  * **what was right in his eyes** - The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. AT: "what Yahweh judges to be right" or "what Yahweh considers to be right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
