===== translationNotes: =====

  * **You cover the altar of Yahweh with tears** - This statement shows the prophet's strong feelings against what the people are doing in their false worship of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **with weeping and sighing** - The words "weeping" and "sighing" share similar meanings and intensify the idea of weeping. AT: "with great weeping" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **does not turn with favor toward the offering** - Here "turn with favor toward the offering" stands for the idea of receiving the offering with favor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **from your hand** - Here "hand" stands for the person giving the offering. AT: "from you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
