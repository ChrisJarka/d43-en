===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **There the wicked cease from trouble; there the weary are at rest**  - Job uses parallelism to emphasise what he is saying (See:Parallelism)
    * **There the wicked cease from trouble**  - "In that place, evil people stop causing trouble." Job is talking about the place where people go after they stop living.  
    * **cease from trouble** - "stop causing trouble." In the Hebrew, there is no word for "from." It is supplied in the translation so that the clause makes sense.
    * **there the weary are at rest**  - "in that place, very tired people are at peace." "Weary" means "very tired."
    * **There the prisoners are at ease together**  - "People who were in prison are at peace together." In the Hebrew, there is no word for "there." It is supplied in the translation to make the English sound better.
    * **they do not hear the voice of the slave driver**  - "they do not hear the shouts of people who force them to work" "Slave drivers" are people who force slaves to work. Job uses "the voice of the slave driver" to refer to the power that they have over the slaves. Alternate translation: : "They are no longer under the power of the slave drivers." (See:Metonymy)
    * **The small and the great**  - This is a figure of speech which means "all people, both poor and rich." (See:Merism)
    * **the servant is free from his master there** - In the Hebrew, there is no word for "there." See previous note.
    * **the servant is free from his master** - "those who were slaves no longer have to obey their masters" (UDB)
