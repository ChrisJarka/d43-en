====== Verbs ======

This module answers the question: What are verbs? And it gives help in how to look at your language verbs. Before you start this module have you learned about:

===== Description =====

Summary \\ Verbs tell the events happening and the state of things but also often the time, the manner in which it was done and who did it. Without verbs, you have no text!

Definition \\ Verbs either link the subject to a descriptive portion of the sentence or express an action or a state-of-being (e.g. am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been). Many languages use more verbs than English does. In languages verbs frequently mark person, number, time, type of action (aspect), whether the action is done by someone or to someone and whether it is a statement or wish (mode) although rarely does a language mark them all in the main verb. Often some of these ideas are carried by other verbs or adverbs. Events are usually expressed by VERBS.

=== Reason this could be a translation issue ===

Verbs carry the largest part of the meaning of a sentence; so it is very important to understand both what the English and your language verbs are doing.

The context of the sentence determines the type of verb because some can function in different ways. For example, “The fish tasted oily,” uses tasted as a linking verb that describes the subject (the fish). “John tasted the fish” uses tasted as an action verb showing what the subject (John) did. \\ Some of the things that may be marked in the verb.

**Tense or time**

English usually marks the past by adding “ed” to the end of the verb. Unfortunately a number of common words are exceptions and have different past tenses. The future is marked by putting the verb “will” before the verb. When there are two times, the earlier time is marked by adding the verb “to have.” How is time handled in your language: in the verb or with a time word like “yesterday” or “already?” \\ Example

  * They __hear__  the train __coming__. (present tense)
  * They __heard__  the train __come__  an hour ago. (past tense)
  * Tomorrow they __will hear __  two trains coming. (future tense)
  * They __have heard __  the train every day since they __moved__  to town. (two times: past and distant past)

**aspect**

English has two aspects the completive for actions as a whole; and the continuative which is marked by the verb “to be” for ongoing action. All other aspectual ideas are handled by adverbs. How does your language mark aspectual like ideas; in the verb or with special verbs or adverbs? \\ Example:

  * I __translate__  every Sunday.
  * I __am translating __  the Bible right now.

**mode **  \\  \\ Mode is the difference between statement, question, command and wish. Mode is marked in English by a special group of verbs called **modal verbs**. These create special challenges as most have two or more different meanings.. These verbs function in different ways in sentences; their purpose can only be determined in context. Modal verbs can be used to convey responsibilities, expectations, inferences, possibilities or needs. Several examples are giving below. Modal verbs include: can, may, must, will and shall and their past tenses: could, might, must, would and should. Here are some examples of difficulty of **modal verbs**  in English. How do you handle mode in your language?

**Can and May.**  The verb “can” shows ability or power; “may” is a modal verb involves permission or possibility. Examples:
  * 'I __can__  read' states a fact.
  * '__May__  I read now?' seeks permission to read'
 
**Must.**  Like 'can' and 'may' this is a 'modal verb.' The context of the sentence is important to understanding the meaning. Must can show an obligation or an opinion/assumption of the speaker.
  * I __must call __  my pastor. In this case, must indicates a responsibility.
  * He __must be __  overwhelmed with calls. In this sentence, must indicates a strong assumption/belief about the person spoken of.
 
**Has to.**  This is another modal verb that must be considered in context. It can denote obligation, opinion/inference/assumption or need.
  * He has to finish the test. (Obligation)
  * He has to be nearly done. (Inference/assumption)
  * He has to have insulin. (Personal need)

**person**

Many languages have different forms to agree with the subject or in some languages the object. English only marks the present tense third person singular by adding an “s.” One exception is the verb “to be” which uses “am” for present tense first singular and “is” for third person singular. All the rest are “are,” In the past “was” for both first and third singular and “were” for all the rest. How does your language handles person? Is it in the verb or handles by nouns and pronouns? \\ Example

  * I translate, and he tranlate__s__

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Tense**

  * (present tense) **we __know__  that you __are__  a teacher__ come __  from God**  (John 3:2 ULB)
  * (past tense) ** Now there __was__  a Pharisee whose name __was__  Nicodemus** (John 3:1 ULB)
  * (two times) **the life __was manifested__, and we __have seen__** (1 John 1:2 ULB)

**Aspect**

  * //(completive) ** we __declare__  to you**  (1 John 1:3 ULB) 
  * //(continuative) ** the life __was manifested__** (1 John 1:2 ULB) 

**Active or passive** 
 
  * //(active) ** the world __does not know __  us, because it __did not know __  him**  (1 John 3:1 ULB) // 
  * //(passive) **I __was grasped __  by Christ Jesus. **  (Philippians 3:12 ULB) \\ 
 
**Mode** 
 
  * //(statement) **I __can__  do all things through him who __strengthens__  me.**  (Philippians 4:13 ULB)
  * //(wish) **that I __may grasp __  that for which I was grasped by Christ Jesus. **  (Philippians 3:12 ULB)// 
==== Verbs and Objects ====

All sentences have a SUBJECT (PARTICIPANT), VERB (EVENT), and some an OBJECT (PARTICIPANT). \\ Examples:

  * The sun rises at six in the morning. (No object/participant)
  * Jim kicks the football. (football is the object)

English grammar allows for not stating the object of the verb even if that verb can take an object; so that these sentences may also only have the SUBJECT (PARTICIPANT) and VERB (EVENT) stated. \\ Examples:

  * '//He has been **singing**  for three hours//.' The object is not stated.
  * '//He has been **singing **__hymns__  for three hours.//' "Hymns" is the object of "singing."

Note that different languages have different [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_order|orders]] for these parts of the sentences. In the examples below, the subject is first, the verb is bold, and the object is underlined. \\
 \\
In English, it is sometimes alright to leave out the object when the object is not important in the sentence.

  * He **sang **__a song__.
  * He likes to **sing**.

In some languages, a verb that needs an object must always take one, even if the object is not very important. In all of these sentences, English can leave out the object.

  * He likes to **sing**__ songs__.
  * He likes to **cook **__food__.
  * He has not **eaten **__anything__  in three days.
  * He is blind. He cannot **see **__anything__.

Sometimes you may need to include an object even if there is no object in English.

**Some verbs that are often confused with each other.**

**Teach and Learn**. These verbs are partners. Teaching imparts knowledge. Learning means getting knowledge. \\  \\ **Sit, Sat and Set**. These verbs are often confused. "Sit" is used to convey resting or being seated. "Set" means to place something. "Sat" is the past tense for sit. "Set" stays the same in both present and past tense. Examples:

  * 'I __sit__  on a chair.' means 'I rest on a chair.'
  * 'I __set__  my book on the table.' means 'I place my book on the table.' (or, 'I placed my book on the table')
