This module answers the question:  \\
In order to understand this module, it would be good to read 
  * [[link]]  (We need the bullet because of the app.)

[[Summary of 100 words or less]]

 
===== Description =====
Definition  

  * Example(s)  (from the Bible, or short ones we make up--not from English literature)

Purpose of the linguistic topic we are describing (what it communicates, not purpose of this page)  (optional)

**Reason this is a translation issue:** (recommended) \\
[[Chris, sometimes there is only one reason. In that case it is convenient to write it on the same line. Sometimes there are multiple reasons. In that case, it makes sense to treat this as a heading. Is that ok. If we treat it as a heading is it better to use 3 equal signs on each side, or to simply bold it (These brackets don't like question marks) Chris says it's fine to do it both ways, and it's better to simply bold it, not make it a header. (Don't make headings other than the 5 equal sign heading.) ]]
==== Translation Principles  (optional) ====

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**ULB Text.** (Book c:v ) \\ 
Explanation of how this is an example 

[[Chris, should we format like these, or bullet the example and further indent the bulleted explanation?]]

**You cannot serve God and wealth.** (Matthew 6:24 ) \\  
Jesus speaks of wealth as if it were a master whom people might serve. Loving money and basing our decisions on it is like serving it as a slave would serve his master.  

**Does not Wisdom call out? Does not Understanding raise her voice?** (Proverbs 8:1) \\ 
The author speaks of wisdom and understanding as if they are a woman who calls out to teach people. They are not something hidden, but something obvious that people should pay attention to. 

**Discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you.** (Proverbs 2:11 ) \\
 The author speaks of discretion and understanding as if they could watch over and guard you. If you have discretion and understanding you will be safe because you will not do foolish things that could hurt you.    

===== Translation Strategies =====
If (an) x would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it/one. If not, here [are other options / is another option] \\ 
//(Content writer, please replace x with the issue this page is about. Reword the two sentences as needed.)//
  - first strategy 
  - second strategy
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
A numbered list of examples that match the strategies above. Each strategy should have an example - even if the first strategy is to maintain the  form or figure. Each strategy should have only one example because of  challenges with the Door43 formatting. [[Chris, is this still an issue now that we're not doing the indented numbering?]] \\
 
1. Copy of the strategy (No indentation. Force the numbering.)\\ 
  * **The ULB  Text in bold [underline words of issue]** (Bible Reference) Explanation of application of strategy 
    * "Sample of translation after strategy is applied." [underline words of issue] 


1. Simply put the adjective or relative clause in a separate sentence.  \\ 
  * ** I hate those who serve __worthless idols__ ** (Psalm 31:6)  When David spoke of "worthless idols," he was acknowledging that idols are worthless. He was not distinguishing worthless idols from valuable idols.  \\ 
    * "I hate those who serve idols. Idols are worthless."   \\ 

2. Put the  adjective or relative clause in a separate phrase with words that show why the information is important. \\ 
  * ** I will call on __Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised__**  (2 Samuel 22:4) There is only one Yahweh. The phrase "who is worthy to be praised" gives a reason for calling on Yahweh. This can be shown with the word "because."  \\ 
    * "I will call on Yahweh, because he is worthy to be praised"
