\v 35 The children of the captivity, that were come out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve
bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a
burnt offering to Jehovah.
\v 36 And they delivered the king’s commissions to the king’s satraps, and to the governors beyond the River: and they
furthered the people and the house of God.
