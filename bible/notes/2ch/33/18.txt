\v 18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the
name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.
\v 19 His prayer also, and how God was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places wherein he
built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the
history of Hozai.
\v 20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
