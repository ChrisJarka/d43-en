\v 6 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths.
\v 7 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them:
then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.
