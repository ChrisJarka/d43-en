\v 20  But if you, a woman under her husband, has gone aside,  if you are defiled, and if some man has lain with you besides your husband'...
\v 21 then the priest will cause the woman to swear with an oath of cursing. The priest will say to the woman... 'Yahweh makes you a curse and an oath among your people if Yahweh makes your thigh to fall away and if Yahweh makes your belly to swell.
\v 22 This water that brings the curse will go into your bowels. It will swell your belly and it will waste away the thighs of your legs.' The woman will say, Amen, Amen.
