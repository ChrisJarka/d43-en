===== Open Bible Stories translationQuestions =====

This module answers the question: How do I use the translationQuestions to check the translation?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:checking:intro_check|Introduction to the Checking Manual]]
  * [[en:ta:vol1:checking:intro_levels|Introduction to the Checking Levels]]

There are sets of questions that you can use to check how well the translation communicates the meaning of the Open Bible Stories or the meaning of the Bible to people who speak your language. The questions for Open Bible Stories are located here:https://door43.org/en/obs/notes/questions/home, and the questions for the Bible are located here: https://door43.org/en/bible/questions/comprehension/home.

Translators should use these questions during the checking process in this way:

    - Translate the story or chapter of the Bible and perform the checks of level 1.
    - Read the translation to some one that speaks your language and who did not help with the translation.
    - Ask this person the questions for the story or chapter that you read.
    - Did the person answer the questions correctly? Then the translation is accurate and is communicating in a natural and clear way.
    - Did they not answer some of the questions correctly? Then ask which part of the translation gave them the wrong idea. You will need to correct the translation at that place so that it gives the right idea.
    - Repeat this process with several different people. Try to ask the questions of both men and women and also young and old people, to make sure that the translation will be clear to everyone in your community.

The translation is ready for the church check of level 2 when language community members who have not heard the translation before can answer the questions correctly.
