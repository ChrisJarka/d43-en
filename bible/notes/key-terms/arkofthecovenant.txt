====== Ark of the Covenant ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Old Testament the Ark of the Covenant was a gold overlaid wooden boxlike structure that was placed inside the Tent of Meeting and eventually the Temple, where Israel would go to meet with God.â€‹

  * By God's command the Ark contained objects of remembrance that were spiritually significant for the Israelites.
  * When God desired to speak to Israel through Moses in the Tent and when Israel's High Priest presented appropriate sacrifices at the Temple, God's presence would appear over the Ark.
  * As a result of Israel's disobedience and captivities the Ark was lost and eventually destroyed.
  * The Ark of the Covenant reappears in heaven in Revelation 11:19.
