\v 7 And now, O Jehovah my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child; I know
not how to go out or come in.
\v 8 And your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted
for multitude.
\v 9 Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who
is able to judge this your great people?
