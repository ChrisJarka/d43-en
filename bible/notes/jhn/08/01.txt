\v 1 Jesus went with his disciples to the Mount of Olives, and they stayed near there that night.
\v 2 Early the next morning, they returned to the temple courtyard. Many people gathered around Jesus, and he sat down to teach them.
\v 3 Then men who taught the Jewish laws and some who were Pharisees brought a woman to him. She had been caught in the act of adulteryâ€”she had been sleeping with a man who was not her husband. They made her stand up in the front of this group so they could question her.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Verse 1 tells us where Jesus went at the end of the previous chapter. 
  * **General Information:** - The next part of the story begins in verse 2 as Jesus has returned to the temple.

  * **7:53 - 8:11** - While some texts have these verses, the best and earliest texts do not include them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_textvariants]])
  * **all the people** - This is an exaggeration to emphasize that a very large number of people came to Jesus. AT: "many people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **The scribes and Pharisees brought** - Here the phrase "scribes and Pharisees" is a synecdoche that represents some of the members of these two groups. AT: "Some men who taught the Jewish laws and some who were Pharisees" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **a woman caught in the act of adultery** - This is a passive statement. You may translate it in an active form. AT: "a woman that they had found committing adultery" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
