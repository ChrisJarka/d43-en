\c 40
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I waited patiently for Jehovah;
\q And he inclined to me, and heard my cry.
\q
\v 2 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay;
\q And he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
\q
\v 3 And he has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God:
\q Many shall see it, and fear,
\q And shall trust in Jehovah.
\q
\v 4 Blessed is the man that makes Jehovah his trust,
\q And respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
\q
\v 5 Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful works which you have done,
\q And your thoughts which are to us-ward:
\q They cannot be set in order to thee;
\q If I would declare and speak of them,
\q They are more than can be numbered.
\q
\v 6 Sacrifice and offering you have no delight in;
\q Mine ears have you opened:
\q Burnt-offering and sin-offering have you not required.
\q
\v 7 Then said I, Lo, I am come;
\q In the roll of the book it is written of me:
\q
\v 8 I delight to do your will, O my God;
\q Yea, your law is within my heart.
\q
\v 9 I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great assembly;
\q Lo, I will not refrain my lips,
\q O Jehovah, you knowest.
\q
\v 10 I have not hid your righteousness within my heart;
\q I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation;
\q I have not concealed your lovingkindness and your truth from the great assembly.
\q
\v 11 Withhold not you your tender mercies from me, O Jehovah;
\q Let your lovingkindness and your truth continually preserve me.
\q
\v 12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about;
\q Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up;
\q They are more than the hairs of my head;
\q And my heart has failed me.
\q
\v 13 Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me:
\q Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.
\q
\v 14 Let them be put to shame and confounded together
\q That seek after my soul to destroy it:
\q Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor
\q That delight in my hurt.
\q
\v 15 Let them be desolate by reason of their shame
\q That say to me, Aha, aha.
\q
\v 16 Let all those that seek you rejoice and be glad in you:
\q Let such as love your salvation say continually,
\q Jehovah be magnified.
\q
\v 17 But I am poor and needy;
\q Yet the Lord thinks upon me:
\q You are my help and my deliverer;
\q Make no tarrying, O my God.
