====== Switching Editors ======

**Visual Editor** – When you click the "Edit this page" button, you will probably see an edit window that looks like a simplified word processor. The buttons take care of formatting text and generally make it easier to use. Here is information on the toolbar icons: [[doku>toolbar|quickbuttons]].

**Text Editor** – If you prefer, you can click the "DW Edit" button beneath the edit box to switch to a text-based editor. This is the standard DokuWiki editor and it provides full control over the syntax of the text. Go to the [[en:ta:tech:door43:syntax|Formatting Text]] page for some simple editing formats to use in the text editor.

//Note:// when using the text editor, you can switch back to the graphical editor by clicking the "CKG Edit" button. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF7px5U6PdA|Here]] is a short video (67 seconds) on how to switch between the text editor and the graphical editor.
