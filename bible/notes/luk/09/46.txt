\v 46 And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.
\v 47 But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,
\v 48 and said to them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receives me: and whoever shall receive me
receives him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.
