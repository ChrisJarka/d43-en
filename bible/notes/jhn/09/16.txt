\v 16 So some of the Pharisees said, "Since this man \add Jesus\add* disobeys \add our rules about working\add* on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f*, he is not from God." But others said, "If he was a sinner, he could certainly not do such miracles!\f + \ft Or: how could he do such miracles? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" So they were divided.
\v 17 So one of them said to the blind man again, "You are the man whom he enabled to see. What do you yourself say about him?" The man said, "\add I think\add* he is a prophet!" \add So they told him to go\add*.

\v 16 Some of the Pharisees said, "We know this man Jesus is not from God because he doesn't honor the Sabbath day.” But others from that group said, “If he was a sinner, how could he do such miracles!" So there was a division among the Pharisees.
\v 17 So they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, since he is the one who restored your sight?" The man said, "He is a prophet." So they told him to go away.

\v 18 The Jews who were opposed to Jesus did not believe that the man had been blind and that now he was able to see. So they sent someone to bring in the man's parents so they could be questioned.
