\v 1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to Jehovah, and spake, saying,
\q I will sing to Jehovah, for he has triumphed gloriously:
\q The horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.
\q
\v 2 Jehovah is my strength and song,
\q And he is become my salvation:
\q This is my God, and I will praise him;
\q My father’s God, and I will exalt him.
\q
\v 3 Jehovah is a man of war:
\q Jehovah is his name.
\q
\v 4 Pharaoh’s chariots and his host has he cast into the sea;
\q And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.
\q
\v 5 The deeps cover them:
\q They went down into the depths like a stone.
\q
\v 6 Your right hand, O Jehovah, is glorious in power,
\q Your right hand, O Jehovah, dasheth in pieces the enemy.
\q
\v 7 And in the greatness of your excellency you overthrowest them that rise up against thee: You send forth your wrath,
it consumes them as stubble.
\q
\v 8 And with the blast of your nostrils the waters were piled up,
\q The floods stood upright as a heap;
\q The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
\q
\v 9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;
\q My desire shall be satisfied upon them;
\q I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
\q
\v 10 You did blow with your wind, the sea covered them:
\q They sank as lead in the mighty waters.
\q
\v 11 Who is like to thee, O Jehovah, among the gods?
\q Who is like thee, glorious in holiness,
\q Fearful in praises, doing wonders?
\q
\v 12 You stretched out your right hand,
\q The earth swallowed them.
\q
\v 13 You in your lovingkindness have led the people that you have redeemed:
\q You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.
\q
\v 14 The peoples have heard, they tremble:
\q Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
\q
\v 15 Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed;
\q The mighty men of Moab, trembling takes hold upon them:
\q All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.
\q
\v 16 Terror and dread falls upon them;
\q By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone;
\q Till your people pass over, O Jehovah,
\q Till the people pass over that you have purchased.
\q
\v 17 You will bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance,
\q The place, O Jehovah, which you have made for you to dwell in,
\q The sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands have established.
\q
\v 18 Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever.
\p
\v 19 For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the
waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.
\v 20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with
timbrels and with dances.
\v 21 And Miriam answered them,
\q Sing you to Jehovah, for he has triumphed gloriously;
\q The horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.
\p
\v 22 And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in
the wilderness, and found no water.
\v 23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it
was called Marah.
\v 24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
\v 25 An he cried to Jehovah; And Jehovah showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet.
There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them;
\v 26 and he said, If you will diligently listen to the voice of Jehovah your God, and will do that which is right in his
eyes, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have
put upon the Egyptians: for I am Jehovah that heals thee.
\v 27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees: and they encamped there by
the waters.
