====== Biblical distance, money, time, volume, weight ======

===== Definition: =====

We have Important Term page for the major categories of Biblical units. However, if we link them in the Important Terms section, the general title will appear rather than the title of the individual unit (cubit, denarius, etc.). Therefore, we suggest that the unit be included in a note, followed by the link to the appropriate term page.


===== Standard Notes: =====

  * **twenty shekels in weight** - Alternate translation: 200 grams of bread.” (See: biblical measures)

  * **a sixth of a hin** - “1/6 hin” or “a sixth part of a hin” or “about one-half liter” (UDB). (See: biblical weights)

  * **sixty stadia** - eleven kilometers (See: biblicaldistances)
