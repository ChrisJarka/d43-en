\v 23 And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it;
nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the
field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass
over him;
