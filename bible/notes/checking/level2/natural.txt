====== Natural Language ======

These are questions you can ask to see if the flow of the language of the translation sounds natural for your language group:

Q? Is there a good flow to the language when the passages are read out loud? (Does the language sound like the writer was a person from your own community?)

Q? Does the translator use words well? (Are the people and places of the story described using expressions commonly heard in your community?)

Q? Is this the way people talk in your area? (Does the speaker sound strange or perhaps like someone from outside your community?)

Q? Does each section fit well with the sections before and after it, or is it sometimes difficult to tell how the sections connect? (Did the translator use the right introduction or connection words at the beginning of sections?)

Q? Does the translation introduce the people in the story and refer to therm in a way that is normal for stories in your language? (Is it difficult to tell who is doing or saying some of the things in the story?)
