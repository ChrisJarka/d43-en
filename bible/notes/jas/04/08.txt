\v 8 Come near spiritually to God. If you do, he will come near to you. You who are sinners, turn away from doing what is wrong and do only what is good. You who cannot decide whether you will commit yourselves to God, stop thinking wrong thoughts, and think only his thoughts.
\v 9 Be sorrowful and weep because of the wrong that you have done. Do not laugh, enjoying only what you selfishly desire. Instead, be sad because you have done what is wrong.
\v 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord; if you do, he will honor you.

\v 8 Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
\v 9 Grieve, mourn, and cry!  Turn your laughter into sorrow and your joy to gloom.
\v 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.
