===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is hospitality? ===

Hospitality was an important concept in the ancient Near East. It was important to be friendly towards a foreigner or outsider and provide help to them if they needed it.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How does the author use family relationships? ===

The author uses the terms "brother" and "Gentile" in a way that can be confusing. Many times in Scripture the term "brother" is used when speaking of the relationship between two Jews, but in this book it is used in speaking of two Christians who are spiritually brothers. Likewise, John refers to people as his "children" in reference to them being spiritual children. John also uses the term "Gentile" a way to reference those who are ignorant of the knowledge of Jesus.
