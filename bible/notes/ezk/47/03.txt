<usfm>
\v 3 As the man continued walking toward the east, he had a measuring line in his hand. He measured off 1,750 ft.\f + \ft Or: 530 meters \f* and then led me through water that covered my ankles.
\v 4 Then he measured off another 1,750 ft.\f + \ft Or: 530 meters \f* and led me through water that was up to my knees. Then he measured off another 1,750 ft.\f + \ft Or: 530 meters \f* and led me through water that was up to my waist.
\v 5 Then he measured off another 1,750 ft.\f + \ft Or: 530 meters \f* and led me through water that was now a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen very high, with the result that it would be necessary to swim across it. It was a river that no one could cross \add by walking across it\add*.

\v 3 As the man continued walking toward the east, I saw that he had a measuring line in his hand. He measured off about five hundred meters and then led me through water that covered my ankles.
\v 4 Then he measured off another five hundred meters and led me through water that was up to my knees. Then he measured off another five hundred meters and led me through water that was up to my waist.
\v 5 Then he measured off another five hundred meters and led me through water that was now a river that I could not cross, because the water was so deep; to continue farther would have required me to swim.

\v 3 As the man was going toward the east, there was a measuring line in his hand; he measured off one thousand cubits and brought me through the water to ankle-deep water.
\v 4 Then he measured one thousand cubits again and brought me through the water to knee-deep water; and he measured another thousand cubits and brought me to hip-deep water.
\v 5 Next he measured off one thousand cubits farther, here it was a river that I was not able to pass, it was so deep. One could only swim it.
