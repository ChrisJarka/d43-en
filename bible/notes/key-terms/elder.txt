====== elder, overseer ======

===== Definition: =====

Elders are men who are spiritually mature, who have responsibilities of spiritual and practical leadership among God's people. The term "elder" came from the fact that older men tended to be wiser and therefore better able to lead.

  * In the Old Testament, the elders helped lead Israel, participating in matters of social justice and in religious matters such as maintaining the Law of Moses.
  * In the New Testament, Jewish elders continued to be leaders in their communities and also acted as judges for the people.
  * In the early Christian churches, Christian elders gave spiritual leadership to the assemblies of believers.
  * In the New Testament, there were also younger men who functioned as elders in the early church.
