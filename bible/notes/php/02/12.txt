<usfm>
\v 12 My dear friends, as you consider this, since you have always obeyed \add God\add*, each of you should very reverentially \f + \ft doublet \f* try to do those things \add that are proper for people whom God has\add* saved. \add You should do those things\add* not only when I am with you. \add Instead, you should try\add* even more \add to do them\add* now when I am not with you.
\v 13 \add You are able to do these things\add*, since God \add himself\add* causes you to desire to do what he wants you to do, and he also enables you to do what he wants you to do.

\v 12 My dear friends, as you have always obeyed God, not only when I am with you, obey God even more when I am absent, as I am now. With deep respect and awe for God's power, learn about how Christ has saved you from sin and continue to obey him, our God and Savior.
\v 13 God is working in your hearts to give you the power to desire and actually do the good things that please him.

\v 12 So then, my beloved, even as you always obey, not only in my presence but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
\v 13 For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
