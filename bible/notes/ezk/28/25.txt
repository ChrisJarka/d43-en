\v 25 Thus says the Lord Jehovah: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are
scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to
my servant Jacob.
\v 26 And they shall dwell securely therein; yea, they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell securely, when
I have executed judgments upon all those that do them despite round about them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah their
God.
