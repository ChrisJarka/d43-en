\v 6 And it will be in that day, that there will be no light and the glimmering things will grow still.  
[TOUGH verse to translate. I think that the contrast with light demands some sort of light/darkness aspect, rather than cold. Frost glistens, and qp’ can have a sense of reduction or condensation, so…]
\v 7 In that day known only to Yahweh, there will no longer be day or night, for the evening will be a time of light.
\v 8 And it will also be in that day that living waters will go out from Jerusalem, half of the flow will go to the eastern sea, 
and half of the flow toward the western sea, whether it is summer or winter
