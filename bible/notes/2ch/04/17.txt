\v 17 They made them by pouring melted bronze into the clay molds that Huram had set up near the Jordan River between the cities of Succoth and Zarethan.
\v 18 All of those things that Solomon told them to make used a very large amount of bronze, so great was the amount they used that no one knew how much it all weighed.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **The king had cast them ... Solomon made** - The readers should understand that Solomon probably commanded other people to do the actual work. AT: "The king commanded his workers to cast them ... Solomon's workers made" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Zarethan** - This is the name of a city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the weight of the bronze could not be known** - This can be stated in active form. Possible meanings are 1) there was so much bronze no one tried to weigh it. AT: "no one even tried to weigh the bronze" or 2) this is a hyperbole that emphasizes the great amount of bronze. AT: "no one could even determine how much all the bronze weighed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
