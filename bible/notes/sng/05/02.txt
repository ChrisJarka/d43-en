===== Translation Notes: =====

The young woman uses euphemisms to describe her dream so that the way that she describes her dream can be interpreted in two different ways. In the first way, the woman describes a dream about a night when her lover came to visit her at her house. In the second way, the woman describes a dream about a time when she was beginning to have sex with her lover. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **but my heart was awake** - AT: "but my mind was awake." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **There is the sound of my beloved knocking** - Possible interpretations are 1) the lover is knocking on the door of the young woman's house or 2) "I noticed that my beloved was pushing his penis against my vulva."
