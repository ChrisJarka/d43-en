\v 17 They also went down into Sheol with him to them that are slain by the sword; yea, they that were his arm,
that lived under his shadow in the midst of the nations.
\v 18 To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shall you be brought down with the
trees of Eden to the nether parts of the earth: you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by
the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.
