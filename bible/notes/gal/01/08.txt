<usfm>
\v 8 But even if we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* apostles\add* or an angel from heaven would tell you a message that is different from the good message that we told you \add before\add*, I \add appeal to God\add* that \add he\add* punish such a person \add forever\add*.
\v 9 As I told you previously, so now I tell you this once more: Someone is telling you \add what he says is\add* a good message, but it is a message that is different from \add the good message\add* that I gave you. So I \add appeal to God\add* that \add he\add* severely punish that person.
\v 10 \add I said that\add* because \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I do not desire that people approve me, \add contrary to what some have said about me\add*. It is God whom I desire to approve me. \add Specifically, I do not say and do\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* things just to please people. If it were still people whom I was trying to please, then I would not be one who \add willingly and completely\add* serves Christ.

\v 9 As I told you previously, so now I tell you this once more: Someone is telling you what he says is a good message, but it is a message that is different from the good message that I gave you. So I appeal to God that he severely punish that person.
\v 10 I said that because I do not desire that people approve me, contrary to what some have said about me. It is God whom I desire to approve me. Specifically, I do not say and do things just to please people. If it were still people whom I was trying to please, then I would not be one who willingly and completely serves Christ.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you, he should be cursed.
\v 9 As we have said before and now I say again, "If someone proclaims to you a gospel other than the one you accepted, he should be cursed."
\v 10 For do I now want the approval of men or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I still try to please men I would not be a servant of Christ.
