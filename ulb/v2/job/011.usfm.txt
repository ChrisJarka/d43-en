\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
\q
\v 2 Should not the multitude of words be answered?
\q And should a man full of talk be justified?
\q
\v 3 Should your boastings make men hold their peace?
\q And when you mockest, shall no man make you ashamed?
\q
\v 4 For you sayest, My doctrine is pure,
\q And I am clean in your eyes.
\q
\v 5 But oh that God would speak,
\q And open his lips against thee,
\q
\v 6 And that he would show you the secrets of wisdom!
\q For he is manifold in understanding.
\q Know therefore that God exacteth of you less than your iniquity deserveth.
\b
\q
\v 7 Canst you by searching find out God?
\q Canst you find out the Almighty to perfection?
\q
\v 8 It is high as heaven; what can you do?
\q Deeper than Sheol; what can you know?
\q
\v 9 The measure thereof is longer than the earth,
\q And broader than the sea.
\q
\v 10 If he pass through, and shut up,
\q And all to judgment, then who can hinder him?
\q
\v 11 For he knows false men:
\q He sees iniquity also, even though he consider it not.
\q
\v 12 But vain man is void of understanding,
\q Yea, man is born as a wild assâ€™s colt.
\b
\q
\v 13 If you set your heart aright,
\q And stretch out your hands toward him;
\q
\v 14 If iniquity be in your hand, put it far away,
\q And let not unrighteousness dwell in your tents.
\q
\v 15 Surely then shall you lift up your face wiyout spot;
\q Yea, you shall be stedfast, and shall not fear:
\q
\v 16 For you shall forget your misery;
\q You shall remember it as waters that are passed away,
\q
\v 17 And your life shall be clearer than the noonday;
\q Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.
\q
\v 18 And you shall be secure, because there is hope;
\q Yea, you shall search about thee, and shall take your rest in safety.
\q
\v 19 Also you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid;
\q Yea, many shall make suit to thee.
\q
\v 20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,
\q And they shall have no way to flee;
\q And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.
