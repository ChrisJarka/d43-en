\c 6

\v 1 Come, and let us return to Jehovah; for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has smitten, and he will bind us up.
\v 2 After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.
\v 3 And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come to us as the
rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.

\v 4 O Ephraim, what shall I do to thee? O Judah, what shall I do to thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as
the dew that goes early away.
\v 5 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are
as the light that goes forth.
\v 6 For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.
\v 7 But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
\v 8 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is stained with blood.
\v 9 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have
committed lewdness.
\v 10 In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there whoredom is
found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
\v 11 Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee, when I bring back the captivity of my people.
