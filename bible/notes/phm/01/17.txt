\p \v 20 Yes\f + \ft Or: I say it again \f*, my dear friend, because you and I both have a relationship with the Lord, I want you to do this for me. Encourage me \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add by receiving Onesimus kindly, just like you encourage others who believe\add* in Christ.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 17 So if you believe that you and I are doing God's work together, welcome him as you would welcome me. \v 18 If he has done you any kind of harm, or if he is in debt to you, Ilet me take the responsibility for that. \v 19 I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you. I could say to you that you owe me even more than Onesimus owes you, because what I told you saved your own life.

\p \v 20 Indeed, my brother, cause me to rejoice with the Lord. Give me courage in Christ.
