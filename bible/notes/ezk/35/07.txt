\v 7 I will make Mount Seir a desolation—a desolation when I cut off from it anyone who passes through and returns again.
\v 8 And I will fill its mountain with its dead. Your high hills and valleys and all of your streams—those killed by the sword will fall in them.

  * **its mountain with its dead** - "the mountains of Seir with the people of Seir that are dead"
  * **Your high hills** - Yahweh is speaking to the mountain of Seir.

  * **Your cities will not be inhabited** - Alternate translation: "People will not live in your cities." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
