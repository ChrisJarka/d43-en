\v 10 We have heard about how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea for you to cross it when you left Egypt. And we have heard how you killed Sihon and Og, the two kings of the tribe of Amor who lived east of the Jordan \add River\add*. You \add Israelites\add* totally destroyed everyone and \add everything in their kingdom\add*.
\v 11 When we heard about those things, we were very dismayed. We no longer have courage to fight against you, because we know that Yahweh, the God \add whom you worship\add*, is helping you. \add And we know that\add* he rules everything up in heaven and here on earth.

\v 10 We have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea in front of you when you came out of   Egypt. We also heard what you did to the two kings of the Amorites on other   side of the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you completely destroyed.
\v 11 As soon as we had heard it, we were terrified. There was no courage left in anyone because of   you. Yahweh your God, he is God in the heaven above and on earth below.
