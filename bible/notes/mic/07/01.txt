\c 7
\p
\v 1 Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no
cluster to eat; my soul desires the first-ripe fig.
\v 2 The godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt
every man his brother with a net.
