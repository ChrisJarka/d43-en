====== 1 Corinthians 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 3:19 and 20, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Paul says the Corinthian believers are immature because they are fighting among themselves. He calls them fleshly meaning thinking as a nonbeliever. The Apostles that served them are not competitors but fellow works and God is the important one.  Finally he returns to the twin themes that this world’s wisdom is foolishness and they should not be fighting over which apostle they follow.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

There are many metaphors [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] in this chapter: 
He uses "babies and milk not meat" for spiritual immaturity. 
Paul says “I planted and Apollos watered” means Paul started the church in Corinth and Apollos added to the congregation. 
Paul also likens the congregation to a garden and to a temple. 
He uses gold, silver, precious stones as examples of work that will last and wood, hay, and straw as work that will not last. 
Finally he speaks of fire as a test of quality

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===
