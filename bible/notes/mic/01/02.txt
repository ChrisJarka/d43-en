\q
\v 2 Listen, all you peoples.
\q Listen, earth, and all that is in you.
\q Let the Lord Yahweh be a witness against you,
\q the Lord from his holy temple.
\q
\v 3 Look, Yahweh comes out of his place;
\q he will come down and tread
\q on the high places on the earth.
\q
\v 4 The mountains will melt under him;
\q the valleys will break apart,
\q like wax before fire,
\q like waters that are poured down a steep place.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Micah 1:2-7 is about God's judgment on Samaria.

  * **Listen, all you peoples. Listen, earth, and all that is in you** - This begins Micah's prophecy. Micah speaks to the people of Samaria as if all the people of the earth and even the earth itself were able to hear him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **he will come down and tread on the high places on the earth** - Micah speaks as if Yahweh were a mighty soldier coming down from heaven and beginning to march on top of the mountains. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he will ... tread** - "he will ... march"
  * **the high places on the earth** - "the high mountains"
  * **The mountains will melt under him; the valleys will break apart, like wax before fire, like waters that are poured down a steep place** - Micah speaks as if Yahweh were a hot, solid object that melted the earth as it moved. AT: "He will crush the mountains and the valleys as he marches over them; he will destroy them, and they will completely disappear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
