\v 19 So the two women continued walking until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived there, everyone in town was excited to see them. The women of the town exclaimed, "It is hard to believe that this is Naomi!"
\v 20 Naomi said to them, "You should not call me Naomi any more, which means 'pleasant'. Instead, call me Mara, which means 'bitter', because God Almighty has made my life very unpleasant.
\v 21 When I left here my life was full because I had a family. But Yahweh has brought me back here feeling empty, without my family. Do not call me Naomi. I feel as though Yahweh seems to be against me. Almighty God has caused a great tragedy to happen to me."

\v 19 So the two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it happened, that when they arrived in Bethlehem, that all the city greeted them with enthusiasm. And the women said, "Is this Naomi?"
\v 20 And she said to them, "Don't call me Naomi, call me Bitter, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
\v 21 I went out full, and Jehovah has brought me home again empty. So, why do you call me Naomi, seeing Jehovah has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?
