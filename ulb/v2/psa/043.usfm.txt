\v 1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation:
\q Oh deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
\q
\v 2 For you are the God of my strength; why have you cast me off?
\q Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
\q
\v 3 Oh send out your light and your truth; let them lead me:
\q Let them bring me to your holy hill,
\q And to your tabernacles.
\q
\v 4 Then will I go to the altar of God,
\q To God my exceeding joy;
\q And upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God.
\q
\v 5 Why are you cast down, O my soul?
\q And why are you disquieted within me?
\q Hope you in God; for I shall yet praise him,
\q Who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
