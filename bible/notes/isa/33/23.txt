\v 23 Your riggings are slack; they could not hold the base of their mast in place, they could not spread the sail: when the
 great spoil is  divided, even  the lame will drag off the spoil.
\v 24 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.
