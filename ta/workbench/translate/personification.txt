====== Personification ======

Personification is a figure of speech in which someone speaks of something as if it were an animal or person. 

People often do this because it makes it easier to talk about things that we cannot see, such as wisdom, sin, and wind. For example: 

  * Does not Wisdom call out? Proverbs 8:1 
  * sin crouches at the door  Genesis 4:7 

People also do this because it is sometimes easier to talk about relationships between people and other people than about relationships between people and non-human things, such as wealth.

  * You cannot serve God and wealth. Matthew 6:24


===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Use the personification if it would be understood correctly.
  * Use the words “like” or “as” to show that the sentences is not to be understood literally. See the example given below from Genesis 4.
  * If it would not be understood correctly, find a way to translate it without the personification. See the example given below from Matthew 8.
===== Examples of Translation Suggestions =====

**sin crouches at the door** Genesis 4:7 \\ 
God speaks of sin as a wild animal that is waiting for the chance to attack.  This shows how dangerous sin is. It can be translated as "sin is at your door, waiting to attack you" or "sin is about to destroy you, just as a wild animal could harm a person." 
 
**even the winds and the sea obey him**  Matthew 8:27 \\ 
The men speak of the wind and the sea as if they are able to hear and obey Jesus as people can. If this would not be understood correctly it could be translated as "He is so powerful that even the winds and the sea obey him" or "He even controls the winds and the sea."

Note: We have broadened our definition of "personification" to include "zoomorphism" (speaking of other things as if they had animal characteristics) and "anthropomorphism" (speaking of other things as if they had human characteristics).
