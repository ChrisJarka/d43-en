====== Copyrighted Materials ======

OK, this is simple--**Do not copy and paste or retype anything from copyrighted materials into this site.** 

The resources that we are creating on this site will be licensed under an open Creative Commons license so that they can be freely shared without restriction or cost. The use of any copyrighted content would violate this status.

**You may use** whatever resources you have in order to research and study for your part of this project. We encourage you to use whatever books, journals, software, etc. that you have in order to understand how to create our resources. 

**You may not use**, however, the statements, descriptions, or direct explanations from those copyrighted resources in our materials.

**You must** pass what you learn from those resources through your own mind, and then use your own understanding to create original content that can be freely distributed. 

//The only exception:// On rare occasions, you may think it is vital for the team to know about something from a copyrighted resource, and you would like to share it in the Discussion section of the page. Even this risks the problem of someone else not understanding the source, and inadvertently copying it into the content area of a page. Therefore we ask that you do this only as a last resort. If you can summarize it, please do. Or if it is online, link to it rather than copying it to Door43. If that fails, and you still think it is important, please state clearly in your discussion post that it is copyrighted material and list the source.
