====== Yahweh ======

===== Description =====

The name "Yahweh" is often translated as "LORD" or "Jehovah" in many modern versions. It is used so often that it is a KT. However, we suggest that it might be helpful to add a note at the beginning of a book where it is used.

===== Standard Notes =====

  * **Yahweh** - This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the Translation Word page on Yahweh concerning how to translate this.
