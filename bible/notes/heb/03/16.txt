\v 16 You must keep trusting in God because you must remember who it was who rebelled against God although they heard him speaking to them.
\v 17 And you must remember who it was that God was disgusted with for forty years.
\v 18 And you must remember about whom God solemnly declared, "They will not enter the land where I would let them rest." It was those Israelites who disobeyed God.
\v 19 So, from that example we perceive that it was because they did not keep trusting in God that they were unable to enter the land where they would rest.

\v 16 For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses?
\v 17 And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
\v 18 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?
\v 19 And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
