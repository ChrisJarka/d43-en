====== Jonah 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

We are now back into narrative and do not have to deal with poetry for the rest of the book! 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

In the King's proclamation, the animals had to participate in the fast he ordered. This most likely reflects their pagan mindset. There was nothing in the Old Testament law that instructed the people to have the animals participate in any religious acts. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

When the author talks about the size of Nineveh, the measurements he gives are confusing. In Jonah's day, cities were not as big as they are today. So although Nineveh was a big city (120,000 people verse ), it was not as big as our modern cities could be. 

The last verse of this chapter says that "So then God changed his mind about the punishment that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it." This concept of God changing His mind may be troubling for some translators and people to understand. God's character is consistent. He is just and merciful so even though God did not follow through with a judgment in this instance, God's plan is always to punish the evil and the sinner. Later in history this nation did fall and was obliterated.
