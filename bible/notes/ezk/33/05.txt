\v 5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him; whereas if he had taken warning, he
would have delivered his soul.
\v 6 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, and the sword come, and
take any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchmanâ€™s hand.
