\v 8 Endure everything by remembering how Jesus Christ endured it when he suffered. Remember that he was raised  from the dead and God affirmed, Or: declared him to be king as his ancestor King David was. Those are things that I tell to people when I tell them the message about Christ. Remember Jesus Christ, a descendent of King David, arose from the dead, as I also preach in the gospel message.
\v 9 I am suffering here in prison because some people oppose the good message that I tell. They have even put me in chains as if I were a criminal. Nevertheless, the message from God is not chained . For this gospel I suffer to the point of being imprisoned as a criminal. But, the word of God is not imprisoned.
\v 10 Therefore I willingly endure all that I am suffering for the sake of those whom God has chosen. I do this in order that Christ Jesus will save them, too, and that they will be forever with him in the glorious place where he is.
Therefore I endure all things for those chosen by God, so they may experience the salvation in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
