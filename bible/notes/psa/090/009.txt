\v 9 Because you are angry with us, you cause our lives to end;

\v 10 People live for only 70 years;
\q2 but if they are strong, some of them live for 80 years.
\q1 But even during good years we have much pain and troubles;
\q2 our lives soon end, and we die \f + \ft euphemism \f*.

<usfm>
\q
\v 9 For all our days are passed away in your wrath:
\q We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
\q
\v 10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten,
\q Or even by reason of strength fourscore years;
\q Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow;
\q For it is soon gone, and we fly away.
