\v 6 Our Israelite ancestors walked through the desert for forty years, until all the people, including all the men who were old enough to be soldiers, that all of them had died. They had not obeyed Yahweh, so Yahweh solemnly said that they would not see the land that he had promised to our ancestors—a land that was very fertile—the land was so fertile that they said it had milk and honey flowing through it, like rivers of water.
\v 7 It was the children of those who had died that  Yahweh raised up in their place.  He circumcised them because they had not been circumcised when they were walking through the desert.
