<usfm>
\v 16 Then you became busy buying and selling things,
\q2 and you started to act violently,
\q2 and you sinned.
\q1 So I caused you to be disgraced;
\q2 and the angel who was guarding you forced you to leave my holy mountain,
\q2 forced you to leave your place among those fiery stones.
\q1
\v 17 You were extremely proud
\q2 because you were very handsome.
\q1 Because you loved beautiful things,
\q2 you did things that wise people do not do.
\q1 So I threw you to the ground,
\q2 and allowed other kings who saw you to laugh at you.

\v 16 In the multitude of your trade they filled your midst with violence, so you sinned! So I have cast you as profane from the mountain of God and destroyed you, covering cherub, from the midst of the fiery stones.
\v 17 Your heart was arrogant with your beauty, you corrupted your wisdom by your splendor! I have sent you down to the earth! I have set you before kings so they may see you!
