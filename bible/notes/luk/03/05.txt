===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (The quote from Isaiah's prophecy continues.)
    * **Every valley will be filled**  - When people prepare the road for someone important coming, they fill in the low places with dirt so that the road will be level. This could also be translated as "They will fill in every low place in the road." This is part of the metaphor started in Luke 3:4. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]])
    * **Every mountain and hill will be made level**  - This could also be translated as, "They will level every mountain and hill" or, "They will remove every high place in the the road."
    * **the crooked roads will become straight** - That is, "the winding roads will be straightened."
    * **the crooked roads will become straight** - Or "that which is crooked will become straight for its' own benefit."
    * **rough ways will be made smooth** - That is, "the bumpy roads will be smoothed out."
    * **see the salvation of God**  - That is, "will learn about how God saves people from sin."
