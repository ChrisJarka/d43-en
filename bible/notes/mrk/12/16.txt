===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They brought one to Jesus**  - The Pharisees and the Herodians brought Jesus a Roman government coin, called a Denarius, that he asked for in 12:15.  
  * **Whose likeness and inscription is this?**  - Jesus asks whose picture and title is on the coin.
  * **Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's** -"Give to the Roman government the things that belong to the Roman Government." Caesar, who is the ruler of the Roman empire, is used here to mean the Roman Government (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]]).   
  * **They marveled at him.**  - They were amazed by his wise answer.
