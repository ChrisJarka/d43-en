\v 10 Go you up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her branches; for they are not Jehovahâ€™s.
\v 11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, says Jehovah.
\v 12 They have denied Jehovah, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
\v 13 and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done to them.
