\v 30 And he said, "With what can we compare the kingdom of God or with what parable shall we use to represent it?
\v 31 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, it is the smallest of all the seeds upon the earth,
\v 32 yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all the garden plants, and it puts out great branches, so that even the birds of the sky can make nests under its shade."
