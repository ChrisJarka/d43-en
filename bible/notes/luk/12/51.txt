\v 51 Do you think that as a result of my coming to earth people will live together peacefully? No! I must tell you, \add that is not what will happen! Instead, people\add* will be divided.
\v 52 Because some people in one house \add will believe in me and some will not\add*, they will be divided. Three people in one house \add who do not believe in me\add* will oppose two \add who do believe\add*, or two \add who do not believe in me\add* will oppose three \add who do believe\add*.
\v 53 A man will oppose his son, or a son will oppose his father. A woman will oppose her daughter, or a woman will oppose her mother. A woman will oppose her daughter-in-law, or a woman will oppose her mother-in-law."

\v 51 Do you think that I came to bring peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
\v 52 For from now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
\v 53 They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."
