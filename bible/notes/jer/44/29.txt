\v 29 And this shall be the sign to you, says Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that my words
shall surely stand against you for evil:
\v 30 Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of
them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy,
and sought his life.
