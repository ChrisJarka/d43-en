\v 11 Yahweh spoke to Moses. He said,
\v 12 "Behold, I myself have taken the Levites from among the descendants of Israel instead of all the firstborn that opens the womb among the descendants of Israel. The Levites will be mine.
\v 13 All the firstborn are mine. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed to me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They are  mine. I am Yahweh."
