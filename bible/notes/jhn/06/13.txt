\v 13 So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over
to them that had eaten.
\v 14 When therefore the people saw the sign which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that comes into the
world.
\v 15 Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the
mountain himself alone.
