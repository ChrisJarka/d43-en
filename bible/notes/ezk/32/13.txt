===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh is speaking.
  * **all the livestock** - Livestock are animals that people have to eat and for other reasons. Cows, sheep, and goats are all livestock.
  * **from beside the plentiful waters** - "from the places where there is a lot of water"
  * **the foot of man** - "the feet of people"
  * **Then I will calm their waters** - "Then I will make all of the dirt settle out of the water." When no one stirs up the water, the water will be clean and clear.
  * **make their rivers run like oil** - Yahweh compares the water of the rivers with oil either because 1) the water will be smooth and clear like oil 2) the water will be very good and valuable like oil. Possible translations are 1) "make the waters of the river smooth and clear like oil" or 2) "make the the water of the rivers very good and valuable like oil." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
