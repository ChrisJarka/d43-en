<usfm>
\v 22 The wind shall feed all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shall you be ashamed and
confounded for all your wickedness.
\v 23 O inhabitant of Lebanon, that make your nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied shall you be when pangs come upon
thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
