\c 18
\q
\v 1 He that separateth himself seeks his own desire,
\q And rageth against all sound wisdom.
\q
\v 2 A fool has no delight in understanding,
\q But only that his heart may reveal itself.
\q
\v 3 When the wicked comes, there comes also contempt,
\q And with ignominy comes reproach.
\q
\v 4 The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters;
\q The wellspring of wisdom is as a flowing brook.
\q
\v 5 To respect the person of the wicked is not good,
\q Nor to turn aside the righteous in judgment.
\q
\v 6 A fool’s lips enter into contention,
\q And his mouth calls for stripes.
\q
\v 7 A fool’s mouth is his destruction,
\q And his lips are the snare of his soul.
\q
\v 8 The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,
\q And they go down into the innermost parts.
\q
\v 9 He also that is slack in his work
\q Is brother to him that is a destroyer.
\q
\v 10 The name of Jehovah is a strong tower;
\q The righteous runs into it, and is safe.
\q
\v 11 The rich man’s wealth is his strong city,
\q And as a high wall in his own imagination.
\q
\v 12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty;
\q And before honor goes humility.
\q
\v 13 He that gives answer before he heareth,
\q It is folly and shame to him.
\q
\v 14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;
\q But a broken spirit who can bear?
\q
\v 15 The heart of the prudent gets knowledge;
\q And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
\q
\v 16 A man’s gift makes room for him,
\q And brings him before great men.
\q
\v 17 He that pleadeth his cause first seems just;
\q But his neighbor comes and searcheth him out.
\q
\v 18 The lot causes contentions to cease,
\q And parts between the mighty.
\q
\v 19 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city;
\q And such contentions are like the bars of a castle.
\q
\v 20 A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth;
\q With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.
\q
\v 21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue;
\q And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
\q
\v 22 Whoso finds a wife finds a good thing,
\q And obtains favor of Jehovah.
\q
\v 23 The poor uses entreaties;
\q But the rich answereth roughly.
\q
\v 24 He that makes many friends does it to his own destruction;
\q But there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother.
