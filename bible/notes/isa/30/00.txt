====== Isaiah 30 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 30, which is an extended quotation.

This chapter begins a series of "woes" against specific nations. This chapter presents judgements against the people of Ephraim and Judah when they desired to make an alliance with Egypt. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:woe]] and [[:en:obe:kt:judge]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Negev==
This is an area between Egypt and Judah. It is an area they would have had to travel through in order to get to Egypt. No one really lived in this area and it was known to be very dangerous.

== Trust ==
The people were to trust in Yahweh. Only he could provide them with protection. The people are being punished for their lack of trust when they were in trouble, but it was only trust that was required. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:trust]]) 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "That day" ==
It appears that some aspects of this prophecy are still to be fulfilled in the last day before or when Yahweh reigns on earth in Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])
