<usfm>
\v 27 For thus says Jehovah, The whole land shall be a desolation; yet will I not make a full end.
\v 28 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have
not repented, neither will I turn back from it.
\v 29 Every city fleeth for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man lives therein.
