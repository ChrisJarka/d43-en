\v 4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me:
\v 6 but whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great
millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea.
