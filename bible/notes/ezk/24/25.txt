\p
\v 25 And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire
of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters,
\v 26 that in that day he that escapes shall come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?
\v 27 In that day shall your mouth be opened to him that is escaped, and you shall speak, and be no more dumb: so shall you be
a sign to them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
