\v 1 Oh sing to Jehovah a new song:
\q Sing to Jehovah, all the earth.
\q
\v 2 Sing to Jehovah, bless his name;
\q Show forth his salvation from day to day.
\q
\v 3 Declare his glory among the nations,
\q His marvelous works among all the peoples.
\q
\v 4 For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised:
\q He is to be feared above all gods.
\q
\v 5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols;
\q But Jehovah made the heavens.
\q
\v 6 Honor and majesty are before him:
\q Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
\q
\v 7 Ascribe to Jehovah, you kindred of the peoples,
\q Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength.
\q
\v 8 Ascribe to Jehovah the glory due to his name:
\q Bring an offering, and come into his courts.
\q
\v 9 Oh worship Jehovah in holy array:
\q Tremble before him, all the earth.
\q
\v 10 Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth:
\q The world also is established that it cannot be moved:
\q He will judge the peoples with equity.
\q
\v 11 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
\q Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
\q
\v 12 Let the field exult, and all that is therein;
\q Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy
\q
\v 13 Before Jehovah; for he cometh,
\q For he comes to judge the earth:
\q He will judge the world with righteousness,
\q And the peoples with his truth.
