===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This passage continues the metaphor of Yahweh's extreme anger as wine that he causes the people of the nations to drink from a cup. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **the sea** - This is a reference to the Mediterranean Sea.
  * **Dedan, Tema, and Buz** - These are the names of places. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **all the ones who cut the hair on the sides of their heads** - This probably refers to people who cut their hair short in order to honor a pagan god. Some modern versions interpret this Hebrew expression as "all the people who live on the edge of the wilderness." See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:09:25|9:26]].
  * **they also had to drink it** - "they also had to drink the wine from the cup"
