====== Go up / Go down ======

===== Description =====

Traveling to or from a location in Israel is often described in terms of elevation with verbs such as "go up" or "go down." Many scholars believe these verbs indicate the relative importance of the locations.

We have decided that it is too complex to ask the MTT to try to explain potential importance when translating these verbs. Therefore, our notes will only include reference to the relative elevations of the two locations.
