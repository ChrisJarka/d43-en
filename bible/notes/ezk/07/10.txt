===== Translation Notes: =====

God continues his prophecy of judgment on Israel through Ezekiel.

  * **Behold**  - This can be translated as “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”
  * **The day is coming. Doom has gone forth**  - Here are two different ways to say that God is about to punish Israel. See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
  * **The day is coming**  - The words "The day" are speaking of when God will punish Israel. "The day of your punishment is coming." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]], [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **Doom has gone forth**  - The word "doom" refers to the certainty of Israel's destruction. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])  The words "has gone forth" refers to the fact that what causes their destruction has already begun to happen. The phrase speaks of doom as something that is moving but doom is a concept and cannot move. "The cause of Israel's destruction has begun."  (See: [[:en:ta:translate:personification]])   
  * **The rod has bloomed with the blossom of pride. Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness**  - A rod is a dead branch from a tree that has been made into a tool for a person who takes care of sheep. A blossom is the end part of a flower.  By saying "the rod has bloomed," the prophet is saying the dead branch has developed a flower. This is something that does not happen naturally. By referring to the rod's blossom as "the blossom of pride" it is saying that the people of Israel should not feel pride because of their wickedness, but they do feel pride. "The people of Israel have become violent and wicked and, instead of feeling bad, they are happy with themselves."(See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **The rod has bloomed…Violence has grown up**  -These phrases refer to the people of Israel's wicked actions growing to the point where God has judged them and is going to punish them. They compare the people of Israel's becoming more wicked and violent to a dead tree branch that has developed a flower. The flower represents the pride of the people of Israel.  (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]]) He speaks of violence as though it is alive.(See: [[:en:ta:translate:personification]])
  * **none of them, and none of their multitude**  - The words "them" and "their" refer to the people of Israel who have worshiped idols. "None of the people of Israel" He seems to double this for emphasis. (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
