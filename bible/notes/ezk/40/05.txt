\p
\v 5 There was a wall outside of the house all around it, and There was a measuring stick in the man’s hand, six cubits long—a cubit and a handspan. And he measured the width of the building – one stick – and the height – one stick.
\v 6 And he went to the gate that faced towards the eastern path and went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gate – one stick in width – and the other threshold – one stick in width.
\v7 So the niche was one stick in length, and one stick wide; and there was five cubits between the niches, and the threshold of the gate beside the gate porch towards the house – one stick.
