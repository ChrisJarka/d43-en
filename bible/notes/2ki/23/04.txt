\v 4 The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests under him, and the gatekeepers, to remove from the temple of Yahweh all the vessels that were used in the worship of Baal and Asherah and for all the stars of heaven. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields in the Kidron Valley and carried their ashes to Bethel.
\v 5 He put an end to the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah appointed to burn incense at the high places of the cities of Judah and on those around Jerusalemâ€”those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and the moon, to the planets, and to all the stars of heaven.
