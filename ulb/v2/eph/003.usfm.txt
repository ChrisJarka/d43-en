\v 1 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,â€”
\v 2 if so be that you have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward;
\v 3 how that by revelation was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,
\v 4 whereby, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;
\v 5 which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles
and prophets in the Spirit;
\v 6 to wit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise
in Christ Jesus through the gospel,
\v 7 whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of
his power.
\v 8 To me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable
riches of Christ;
\v 9 and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages has been hid in God who created all
things;
\v 10 to the intent that now to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly
places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,
\v 11 according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
\v 12 in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.
\v 13 Wherefore I ask that you may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your
glory.
\p
\v 14 For this cause I bow my knees to the Father,
\v 15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
\v 16 that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit
in the inward man;
\v 17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
\v 18 may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
\v 19 and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that you may be filled to all the fulness of God.
\p
\v 20 Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works
in us,
\v 21 to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations for ever and ever. Amen.
