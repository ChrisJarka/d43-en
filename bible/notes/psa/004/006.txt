\q
\v 6 Many there are that say, Who will show us any good?
\q Jehovah, lift you up the light of your countenance upon us.

\v 7 You have put gladness in my heart,
\q More than they have when their grain and their new wine are increased.
\q
\v 8 In peace will I both lay me down and sleep;
\q For thou, Jehovah, alone make me dwell in safety.
