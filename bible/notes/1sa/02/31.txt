\v 31 Listen carefully! There will soon be a time when I will cause all the strong \add young men\add* in your family to die. The result will be that no men in your family will \add live long enough to\add* become old men.
\v 32 You will be distressed and envious as you see the blessings that I will give to the \add other people in\add* Israel. And \add I repeat that\add* no men in your family will ever live long enough to become old men.
\v 33 There is one of your descendants whom I will spare, and not prevent him from serving me as a priest. But he will become blind, and then he will always be sad and grieving. But all your other descendants will die violently.

\v 31 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your fatherâ€™s house, that there shall not be an old
man in your house.
\v 32 And you shall behold the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house for ever.
\v 33 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.
