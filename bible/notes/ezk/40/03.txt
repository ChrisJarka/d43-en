\v 3 And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of
flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
\v 4 And the man said to me, Son of man, behold with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I
shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them to thee, are you brought hither: declare all that you see to the
house of Israel.
