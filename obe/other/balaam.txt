A prophet during the time the Iraelites were at the Jordan River ready to enter the Promised Land of Canaan.

  * Numbers Chapters 22-24 tells the story of the Midianite King Balek when he hired Balaam to curse the Israelites.
  * In Numbers 22, the Angel of the Lord blocked a narrow path when Balaam was traveling to meet King Balek for that purpose.
      * The donkey he was riding dodged the Angel three times, and Balaam beat the donkey after each time.
      * The donkey could see the Angel, but Balaam could not.

      * Then Balaam could see the Angel, who told Balaam not to curse the Israelites, but to bless them.
      * When he met King Balek, Balaam did not curse the Israelites, but followed the instructions of the Lord.
