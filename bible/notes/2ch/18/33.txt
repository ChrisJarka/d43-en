\v 33 And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he
said to the driver of the chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.
\v 34 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until
the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.
