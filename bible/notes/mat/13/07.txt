===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * **choked them**  - This can be translated as "The plants had too many weeds around them." The thorn plants took all the nutrients, water, and sunlight, so the farmer's plants could not grow well.
  * **produced grain **- This can be translated "produced a crop" or "grew more seeds" or "gave fruit."
  * **He who has ears, let him hear **- This metonymy is relating having ears and listening to gaining understanding or knowledge. (See: Metonymy) "He" and "him" are general pronouns addressed to the crowd or the hearer (see UDB). It may be more natural in some languages to use the second person: “You who have ears to hear, hear.” (See: First, Second or Third Person)
  * **He who has ears to hear**  - “Whoever can hear” or “Whoever hears me”
  * **let him hear**  - “let him listen well” or “let him pay attention to what I say”
