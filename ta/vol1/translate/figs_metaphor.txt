===== Metaphor =====

This module answers the question: What is a metaphor?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

==== Definition ====

A metaphor is a figure of speech in which one idea is spoken of as it were another idea. Unlike with similes, this is done without using words such as "like" or "as." (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]].) Usually the second idea is understood better than the first idea. E.g., "You are the salt of the earth" (Matt. ). 
<del>
 that creates a 'word picture' by relating one thing (the topic of the metaphor) to an unrelated object. Metaphors imply (or state directly) that the two things have something in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it. (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]].). A metaphor transfers an image from one familiar object to another object that is less easily understood.</del> 

Some metaphors are more obvious than other metaphors. For example, when Jesus calls King Herod a fox, he is clearly picturing Herod as possessing some quality that foxes were thought to possess.

However, the ways in which people think are often based on hidden metaphors. 

For example, we can say that husbands and wives walk together through life. This thought is based on the idea that **life is a journey**. This basic metaphor says that, just as unexpected things happen to travelers, so unexpected things happen to people in life. It also says that, just as two people can go on a journey together, so they can spend their lives together. Just as two can help each other if they travel together, so they can help each other if they spend their lives together.

When someone uses a metaphor, he is relying on his audience to figure out what he means. For example, if he says, "Husbands and wives should walk together through life," he probably expects his audience to think about several things at the same time: husbands and wives should stay together, they should be willing to share the same hardships, and they should help each other.


<del>In this example, "life" is the topic, "a journey" is the image that is being applied to the topic, and the concept of movement or progression is the point of similarity. Every metaphor has a topic, an image, and a point of similarity. But as with this example, usually the point of similarity is not stated. Often the author expects the reader or hearer to think about the comparison and see the point of similarity for themselves.

==== Purposes of Metaphor ====

  * One purpose of metaphor is to teach about something that is unknown by using something that is better known. <del>indicating that it is similar to something that is already known.
</del>  * Another purpose of metaphor is to emphasize that something has a particular quality, or to indicate that it has that particular trait in an extreme way.
  * Another purpose of metaphor is to lead people to react emotionally to one thing as they would to something else.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

  * If the image in the original is unknown to your people, use an image from your own culture. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. We don't want to have comparisons to things that had not been invented when the books of the Bible were first written.
  * Or if the image in the original is unknown to your people, simply state the point of similarity without using an image.
  * If it would be unclear to your readers how the topic is like the image, you can state the point of similarity clearly. However, do not do this if it was also not clear to the original audience.
  * If the topic is not stated clearly in the original and it would be unclear to your readers what the topic is, state the topic clearly. However, do not do this if the topic was not clear to the original audience. For example, in Matthew 16:6, Jesus told his disciples "Beware of the __yeast__  of the Pharisees and Sadducees." His disciples thought he was talking about bread, but Jesus was warning them about the __teaching__  of the Pharisees and Sadducees. That was the topic, but it was unstated, and the disciples did not understand it at first. If the metaphor were fully stated, it would be, "The teaching of the Pharisees is like yeast." the point of similarity is that they both spread throughout whatever they touch and change it.
  * If the target audience would not understand the metaphor, then change the metaphor to a simile by adding "like" or "as".

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>Jesus said to them. “I am the __bread of life__. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who trusts in me will never be thirsty." John 6:35 

Jesus compared himself to bread, a food that people ate all the time then. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to trust in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.

>… __the rising sun will__  come from heaven to help us, __to shine__  on those who sit in __darkness__  and the __shadow of death__.  Luke 1:78b-79a

This verse has several related metaphors. The Savior is compared to the rising sun, teaching spiritual truth is compared to the sun shining, lacking spiritual truth is compared to sitting in darkness, and the fear of death is compared to a shadow. This means that just as the rising sun shines on those who have been living in darkness, the Savior will come and bring spiritual truth to those who lack spiritual truth and are afraid of death.

==== Examples from English ====

>"He was a walking __dictionary__."

Because he knows the meanings of so many words, he is compared to a dictionary. Dictionaries contain the meanings of many words.

>"Her __heart broke__ when her baby died."

Her heart, or emotions, is compared to a physical thing that can break.
