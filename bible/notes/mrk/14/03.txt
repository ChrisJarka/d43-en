\v 3 And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster
cruse of ointment of pure nard very costly; and she brake the cruse, and poured it over his head.
\v 4 But there were some that had indignation among themselves, saying, To what purpose has this waste of the
ointment been made?
\v 5 For this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred shillings, and given to the poor. And they murmured against
her.
