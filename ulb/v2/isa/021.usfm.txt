\c 21
\p
\v 1 The burden of the wilderness of the sea.
\p As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from a terrible land.
\v 2 A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroyeth. Go up, O
Elam; besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.
\v 3 Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained
so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see.
\v 4 My heart fluttereth, horror has affrighted me; the twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling to me.
\v 5 They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, you princes, anoint the shield.
\v 6 For thus has the Lord said to me, Go, set a watchman; let him declare what he seeth:
\v 7 and when he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of asses, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with much
heed.
\v 8 And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole
nights;
\v 9 and, behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all
the graven images of her gods are broken to the ground.
\p
\v 10 O you my threshing, and the grain of my floor! that which I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, have I
declared to you.
\p
\v 11 The burden of Dumah.
\p One calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?
\v 12 The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if you will inquire, inquire you: turn you, come.
\b
\p
\v 13 The burden upon Arabia.
\p In the forest in Arabia shall you lodge, O you caravans of Dedanites.
\v 14 To him that was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitives with their
bread.
\v 15 For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.
\v 16 For thus has the Lord said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall
fail;
\v 17 and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be few; for Jehovah, the God
of Israel, has spoken it.
