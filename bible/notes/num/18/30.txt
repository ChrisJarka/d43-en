\v 30 Therefore you shall say to them, When you heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.
\v 31 And you shall eat it in every place, you and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.
\v 32 And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it the best thereof: and you shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that you die not.
