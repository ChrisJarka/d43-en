\q2 sometimes a shepherd will be able to snatch from the lion's mouth
\q2 only two legs or an ear of the sheep.

\q
\v 11 Therefore, this is what the Lord Yahweh says:
\q "An enemy will surround the land,
\q and pull down your strongholds
\q and plunder your fortresses."
\q
\v 12 This is what Yahweh says:
\q "As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion
\q two legs only, or a piece of an ear; 
\q so will the people of Israel who live in Samaria be rescued;
\q they will be left with only the corner of a couch
\q or a piece of a bed."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **and plunder your fortresses** - "and steal all the things in your fortresses"
  * **As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion
two legs only, or a piece of an ear** - It can be stated clearly that the shepherd tries to rescue the whole animal. "As the shepherd tries to rescue an animal from the lion's mouth, but is able to save only two legs or a piece of an ear" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **As the shepherd rescues ... the lion** - Here the phrases "The shepherd" and "the lion" refer to any shepherd or lion. AT: "As a shepherd rescues ... a lion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **couch** - a soft chair big enough to lie down on
  * **with only the corner of a couch, or just a corner of a bed** - This passage in Hebrew is difficult to understand, and some modern versions interpret it differently. The interpretation of the UDB, adopted by some modern versions, uses a simile. It means that only a few Israelites will be saved, just as a house owner might save only a few parts of furniture when his house catches on fire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
