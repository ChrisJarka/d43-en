\v 16 So, \add because we know that as a result of our suffering many people will honor God\add*, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* never get so discouraged \add that we stop teaching his message\add*. Although our bodies are getting weaker, \add God\add* encourages us every day and strengthens us in our inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*.
\v 17 \add I know that\add* all these troubles that \add happen to us in this life are\add* not significant and will not last forever. \add When we think of\add* the glorious things \add that God is preparing\add* for us \add to enjoy\add* forever \add in heaven\add*, all \add our suffering now\add* is not important.
\v 18 That is why we say, "We will not continue thinking about \add all the suffering that we\add* are experiencing now. Even though \add we\add* cannot see \add all the things that God has prepared for us in heaven\add*, those are what we should be thinking about." \add That is how we should think\add*, because \add all these troubles\add* that \add we\f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* have \add now\add* will last only a short time. But what \add we will have in heaven\add*, what \add we\add* cannot see \add now\add*, will last forever.

\v 16 So, because we know that as a result of our suffering many people will honor God, we never get so discouraged that we stop teaching his message. Although our bodies are getting weaker,God encourages us every day and strengthens us in our inner beings.
\v 17 I know that all these troubles that happen to us in this life are not significant and will not last forever. When we think of the glorious things that God is preparing for us to enjoy forever in heaven, all our suffering now is not important.
\v 18 That is why we say, "We will not continue thinking about all the suffering that we are experiencing now. Even though we cannot see all the things that God has prepared for us in heaven, those are what we should be thinking about." That is how we should think, because all these troubles that we have now will last only a short time. But what we will have in heaven, what we cannot see now, will last forever.

\v 16 So we do not become discouraged. Even though our outer man is wasting away, our inner man is being renewed day by day.
\v 17 For this momentary trouble that we experience will end up producing an eternal glory which exceeds all measurement,
\v 18 because we do not look at the things which can be seen, but at the things which are unseen. The things which we can see are temporary; but the things which are unseen are eternal.
