===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Bind up my testimony, seal the the official record** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. They are used for emphasis. Alternate translation: "Close up tightly the scroll with this message written on it." (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
  * **my testimony...my disciples** - It is unclear who is speaking here. Possible meanings are 1) Isaiah is speaking to his followers or 2) Yahweh is speaking to Isaiah.
  * **I will wait for Yahweh** - Here "I" refers to Isaiah.
  * **who hides his face from the house of Jacob** - The phrase "hides his face" means that God has removed his favor and his blessing. Also, the house of Jacob refers to the people who live in Israel. Alternate translation: "who has taken away his blessing from the people of Israel." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **I and the sons whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel** - "I and the children Yahweh has given me are like signs to warn the people of Israel." The sons are Shear-Jashub and Maher-shalal-hash-baz whose names are a message to the people of Israel. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:07:03|7:3]] and [[en:bible:notes:isa:08:01|8:1]])
