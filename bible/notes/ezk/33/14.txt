He walks in the statutes of the living and no longer commits iniquity!—he will surely live and not die! \v 16 None of the sins that he has sinned will be remembered concerning him. He has done justly and right and will surely live! </usfm>

For instance, he gives back a loan, returns what he has stolen, and obeys my life-giving laws, no longer doing what is evil. If he does this, then he will surely live and not die. None of his past sins will be brought up again, for he has done what is just and right, and he will surely live."
