===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * **Jesus then told them another parable** - "Jesus then told another parable to the crowd"
  * **is like yeast** - Only a little bit of yeast was needed to make a lot of dough rise. This can be made clear as it is in the UDB.
  * **three measures of flour**  - This can be translated as “a large amount of flour” or with a term that your culture uses for measuring large amounts of flour (see UDB). The three measures of flour may have been enough to bake bread for over one hundred people.
  * **until it rose **- The pronoun "it" is referring to the three measures of flour. The implied information is that the yeast and the three measures of flour were made into dough for baking. (See: Implicit and Explicit Information)
