\v 14 You \add show that you\add* are my friends if you keep doing what I have commanded you.
\v 15 I will no longer call you my servants, because servants do not know \add why\add* their masters \add want them to\add* do things. Instead, I have said that you are my friends, because I, \add acting like a friend\add*, have revealed to you everything that my Father told me.

\v 14 You are my friends if you not only listen to my commands but you live by them.
\v 15 I no longer call you my servants, for the servant doesn't know what the master is doing. But I now call you friends, for everything I have heard from my Father, I have made it all known to you, so you could understand it.
