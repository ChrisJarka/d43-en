\v 10 Then I took the staff that I had named 'Kindness' and I broke it. That \add showed that Yahweh\add* was annulling\f + \ft Or: canceling \f* the agreement that he had made with all the people-groups.
\v 11 So that agreement was ended immediately. And the men who bought and sold sheep who were watching me knew \add by seeing what I was doing\add* that I was giving them a message from Yahweh.
\p
\v 12 I told them, "If you think it is what you should do, pay me \add for taking care of the sheep\add*. If you do not think that is what you should do, do not pay me." So they paid me \add only\add* thirty pieces of silver.

\v 10 So I took my staff 'Favor', and broke it to break my covenant that I had made with all of my people.
\v 11 I broke my covenant in that day and the poor of the flock who watched for me knew that Yahweh had spoken!
\v 12 I said to them, 'If it seems good to you, pay me my wages. But if not, stop.' And they determined my wages: thirty
pieces of silver."
