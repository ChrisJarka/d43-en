====== Proverbs 20:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 1 Drinking a lot of wine or other strong drinks causes people to start fighting; \q2 it is foolish to become drunk\f + \ft Or: intoxicated \f*. \b \q1 \v 2 Being afraid of a king when he is angry is like \f + \ft simile \f* being afraid of a lion when it growls\f + \ft Or: roars \f*; \q2 if you cause the king to become angry, he will execute you. \b \q1 </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 1 Wine makes you loud, and strong drink makes you foolish; \q2 whoever lets alcohol lead them to where they get lost, are not wise. \b \q1 \v 2 The king's wrath sounds like the roaring of a young lion; \q2 the person who makes a king angry is giving up his own life. \b

\q1 </usfm>
