===== Translation Notes: =====

Ezekiel describes a message that God gives him.

  * **The word of Yahweh came to me and said** - Ezekiel says that the "word of Yahweh" spoke to him. What he means is that Yahweh spoke to him with his words. Alternate translation: "Yahweh spoke to me and said." (See: [[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metonymy]])
  * **Son of man **- This refers to Ezekiel. This phrase is the beginning of the words Yahweh spoke to Ezekiel.
  * **put forth a riddle and speak a parable** - "give them a puzzle to think about" or "tell this story as an illustration" (UDB)
  * **Thus says the Lord Yahweh** - "This is what the Lord Yahweh says." The phrase is the beginning of the words Yahweh wants Ezekiel to say to the people of Israel.
  * **A great eagle** - The eagle is large, powerful, and impressive. 
  * **long pinions full of feathers - **  The word "pinion" means the outer end of the wings. Alternate translation: "the ends of its wings were long and full of feathers."
  * **that was multi-colored" - "that had feathers of many different colors"
  * **he set it in a city of merchants**  - "The eagle brought the treetop to a city that was known for its markets."
