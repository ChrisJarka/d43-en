===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **behold** - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to a surprising new part of the story.
  * **female servants**  - "servant wives" or "secondary wives."
  * **four hundred men**  - This large group of men is a threat and Jacob is in great fear for his family. You can make this clearer by translating: "four hundred fighting men" or "four hundred warriors."
  * **Then… in front, followed…, and followed… last of all.**  - the order is reverse status: least important to most. Also, the order is also protective: the ones Jacob wants protected most go last.
  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **He bowed toward the ground seven times**  - Bowing toward the ground is a sign of respect and humility.
