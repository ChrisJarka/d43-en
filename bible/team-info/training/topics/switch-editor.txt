====== Door43 Editors ======

There are two built-in editors in Door43:

  * CKG Edit
  * DW Edit

We have found that both editors have some issues with different browsers. DW Edit can be especially finicky with Internet Explorer. In general, they both tend to work better on Firefox.


==== CKG Edit ====

CKG Edit is a "visual" or "WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get")" editor. 

When you click the "Edit this page" button, this editor is the default version that will normally load. The edit window looks like a simplified word processor.

Here is information on the toolbar icons: [[doku>toolbar|quickbuttons]].


==== DW Edit ====

DW Edit is a "plain text editor." â€“ This is the most basic DokuWiki editor, and it provides full control over the syntax of the text. Go to the [[:en:obs-training:syntax|Formatting Text]] page for some simple editing formats to use in the text editor.


==== Which Editor to Use? ====

We suggest that people who are new to Door43 use CKG Edit. It is easier for most people, and will prevent you from introducing errors in the code for the page.

If you are familiar with programming languages, or have exceptional computer skills, you may want to try DW Edit. It will give you a bit more control over stray spaces and other issues that occasionally happen in the code.


==== How to Switch Editors ====

When you are in the Edit mode for a page, a button will appear to the right of the "Save" button with the option to switch to the other editor. If you are working in "GKG Edit," the button will say "DW Edit." If you are working in "DW Edit," the button will say "CKG Edit."
