\q
\v 15 This is the exultant city that dwelt securely 
\q and said in her heart, 'I am, and nothing is my equal!' 
\q How she has become a horror, a place for beasts to lie down in! 
\q Every one that passes by her will hiss, and shake his hand at her!  
[[‘Nothing is my equal’ was used to capture the idiom of having no one beside Ninevah. It seems to capture the thought nicely and fluidly.]]
