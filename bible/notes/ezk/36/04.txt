\v 4 therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to
the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become
a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about;
\v 5 therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations,
and against all Edom, that have appointed my land to themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with
despite of soul, to cast it out for a prey.
\v 6 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to
the valleys, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because you have borne the shame
of the nations:
