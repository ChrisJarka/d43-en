===== Finalizing =====

//This page answers the question:// //How are audio files finalized?//

Once you have completed all the necessary checking and editing of the files, it is time to finalize your recorded audio. We are choosing to use the term “finalizing” rather than “mastering” because, in the professional audio industry, mastering often includes many steps that are not including in this manual. Many aspects of mastering are not necessary or are simply quite impossible for the sub-optimal context in which we must work, especially without high-end equipment or specialized skills in how to do mastering properly.

Many of the steps of finalizing can be accomplished as the team progresses through the editing phase. We will list the criteria for finalizing an audio file below in a just a moment. No matter if finalizing is done during the editing phase or as a concluding step, it is the responsibility of the recordist to make sure this has been done to every file.

If possible, it is a wise idea to make a backup copy of the “unfinished” audio files before beginning the finishing work. If an error is made in finalizing, you will be thankful to have the original files still available.

Criteria for finished audio files include:

  * 1 second of silence is at the beginning and end of each chapter or story.
  * Markers have been placed in the audio file at each verse or frame.
  * The audio track has been normalized to -3dB (see Guide in Reference section for tips on normalizing)
  * The correct number of files are present in the master project folder.
  * A backup copy of the finished master WAV files has been made and stored in a secure location.
