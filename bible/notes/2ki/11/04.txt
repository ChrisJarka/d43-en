\v 4 In the seventh year, Jehoiada sent and brought the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought
them to himself, into the temple of Yahweh. He made a covenant with them, putting them under oath in the temple of Yahweh. Then he showed them the king’s son.
\v 5 He commanded them, saying, "This is what you must do. A third of you who come in for work on the Sabbath will 
keep watch over the king’s house, 
\v 6 and a third will be at the Sur Gate, and a third at the gate behind the guardhouse. In this way you will keep watch over the palace and form a barrier.”
