\v 14 Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firm our faith in Christ.
\v 15 For we do not have a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our temptationa; but one that has been in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.
\v 16 Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help us in time of need.
