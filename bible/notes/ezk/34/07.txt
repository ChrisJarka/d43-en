\v 7 Therefore, shepherds, hear the declaration of Yahweh:
\v 8 As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—on account of my flock becoming plunder and my flock becoming food for all the living things of the field because there was no shepherd and none of my shepherds sought my flock, but the shepherds shepherded themselves and did not shepherd my flock; 
\v 9 therefore, shepherds, hear the declaration of Yahweh--
\v 10 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold! I am against the shepherds and I will require my flock from their hand! Then I will dismiss them from shepherding the flock and the shepherds will no longer shepherd themselves since I will deliver my flock from their mouth and they will no longer be food for them!
