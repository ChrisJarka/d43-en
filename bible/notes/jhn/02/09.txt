\v 9 And the one who directed the serving tasted the water, which had now become wine. He did not know where the wine had come from. But the servants who had drawn it out of the jar, they knew. And that wine was delicious! So he called to the bridegroom.
\v 10 "Everyone serves the best wine first, and later when the guests have drunk a lot of it and the best is gone, then they serve the cheap wine. But you have kept the best wine until now!"
