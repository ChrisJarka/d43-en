<usfm> \p \q1 \v 5 O house of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the light of Yahweh. \q1 \v 6 For you have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob, \q1 because they are filled with customs from the east and are omen readers like the Philistines, \q1 and they shake hands with sons of foreigners.

\q1 \v 7 Their land is full of silver and gold, and is there no limit to their wealth; \q1 their land also is full of horses, nor is there limit to their chariots. \q1 \v 8 Their land also is full of idols; \q1 they worship the craftmanship of their own hands, things that their own fingers have made. </usfm>
