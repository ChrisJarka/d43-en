This page gives reasons that are widely used and refer to a human "father" and "son."

When the words "Father" and "Son" refer to God they should be translated with words that refer to human fathers and sons. This page tells why. 

**"Father" and "Son" are names which God calls himself in his word, the Bible.**

God himself called Jesus his Son.
>After he was baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water, and... a voice came out of the heavens saying, "__This is my beloved Son__. I am very pleased with him." (Matthew 3:16-17 ULB)
Jesus himself called God his Father.
>Jesus said, "I praise you __Father__, Lord of heaven and earth,... no one knows the __Son__ except the __Father__, and no one knows the __Father__ except the __Son__..." (Matthew 11:25-27 ULB) (See also: John 6:26-57 ULB)
Theologians have found the terms 'Father' and 'Son' to be irreplaceable, because any other terms end up suggesting incorrect things about God. No one should try to replace them in translation.

**"Father" and "Son" __eternally__ and intimately love each other.**
>Jesus said, "Father, glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you... I glorified you on the earth,... Now Father, glorify me... with the glory that __I had with you before the world was created__." (John 17:1-5 ULB)

>The Father __loves__ the Son. (John 3:35-36; 5:19-20 ULB)

>no one knows who the Son is except the Father, an no one knows who the Father is except the Son. (Luke 10:22 ULB)
Father, Son, and Spirit have eternally loved one another. They forever existed together in glory before creation. The Father has always been the Father, and the Son has always been the Son.   

**Father and Son created humanity in their image to love as God loves.**
>"God said, 'Let __us__ make man... after __our__ likeness...' God created man in his own image" (Genesis 1:26 ULB)

>Jesus said, "Only my Father knows who I really am." (Matthew 11:27 ULB)

>Jesus said, "This is my commandment, that you should love one another as I have loved you." (John 15:12 ULB)

The Father and Son have always lived. They created human fathers and sons to be like the Father and Son. God has chosen to reveal himself through normal family relationships. We cannot fully understand the depths of the relationship between God the Father and God the Son, but by translating with words that best represent the relationship between human fathers and sons, God speaks in the way he has chosen.

**Human fathers and sons are fallen and imperfect, but God still desires them to be like him.**

>the wickedness of mankind was great... the thoughts of their hearts was only evil (Genesis 6:5 ULB)

>[all are] under sin, as it is written, "There is none righteous, not one. There is none who understands. There is none who seeks after God. They have all turned away, they together have become useless. There is none who does good, ... all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:9-23 ULB)

>God deals with you as with sons... Should we not... obey the Father of spirits and live? (Hebrews 12:7-9 ULB)

Normal human father-son relationships during Bible times were never as loving or perfect as between Jesus and his Father. But, the translator should not shy away from these God-selected terms. The words "Father" and "Son" allow God to speak to us and correct and guide our understanding of who God has always been. The Bible uses common, normal words for "Father" and "Son," like the English "father" and "son." Choose words in your language that are widely used and refer to a human "father" and "son." 

**The eternal Son humbled himself 2000 years ago and was born of Mary, but his father was God.**
>Then Mary said, "How will this happen, since I am a virgin?" The angel answered her, "The __Holy Spirit__ will come over you and the power of the __Most High__ will overshadow you. Therefore, the holy one who will be born will be called the __Son of God__." (Luke 1:34-35 ULB)

>__Christ Jesus__... did not consider his __equality with God__ as something to hold on to. But instead he emptied himself... in the likeness of men he humbled himself... to the death of the cross. (Philippians 2:5-8 ULB)\\  
Christ is termed "son of the Most High" because the Holy Spirit miraculously placed him in Mary's womb, introducing his mission on earth to be born as a human and provide salvation for humanity.

**God the Father adopts those who believe in his Son as his own children.**
>God sent his Son... that we might receive adoption as sons. Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls, "Abba, Father." (Galatians 4:4-6 ULB)

>God so loved the world, he gave __his only unique Son__, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. God did not send the __Son__... to condemn the world, but so that the world should be saved... He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been condemned already because he has not believed __in the name of the unique Son of God__." (John 3:16-18 ULB)

>we were reconciled to God through the death of his __Son__,... saved by his life. (Romans 5:10 ULB) 

**The terms "Father" and "Son" cannot be replaced by any other terms without suggesting incorrect things about God. No one should try to replace them in translation.**\\

God is eternally Father, Son, and Spirit. God created humanity to have fathers and sons because God himself is Father, Son, and Spirit. God did not chose the words "Father" and "Son" because there are fathers and sons in humanity. Instead, God created us in his image, including fathers bringing forth sons, to illustrate the eternal, loving fellowship of his Persons.

The existence of fathers and sons in humanity is not the reason God describes himself with a 'Father' and a 'Son'. Instead, God created humanity to have fathers and sons because God himself is Father, Son, and Spirit. God did not choose the descriptors 'Father' and 'Son' to use our families to illustrate Himself. Instead, God created us in His image, including fathers bringing forth sons, to illustrate His eternal being and the loving fellowship of His Persons.

Therefore, it is necessary to chose the same terms for God "the Father" and "Son" that are revealed to humanity in God's word, the Bible. God himself is the source of these words, not man. These terms must be translated literally, which means the translator must use words in his language to translate Father and Son that are widely used and refer to a human "father" and his human "son." 
==== Translation Strategies ====

1. Think through all the possibilities that your language has to translate the words "son" and "father" in relation to the "Son of God" and "God the Father." Determine what word for each Person fits the meaning best in the context of God's Persons of "Son" and "Father."

2. If your language has more than one word for "son," use the word that has the closest meaning to "only son" (or "first son" if necessary).

3. If your language has more than one word for "father," use the word that has the closest meaning to "birth father," rather than "adoptive father."
