===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **for I will surely show you** - Here the "you" refers only to Mephibosheth since David is addressing him.  See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]].
    * **you will always eat at my table**  - Here the "my table" refers to being together with or in David's presence.  See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]].   Here the "you" refers only to Mephibosheth since David is addressing him.  See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]].
    * **What is your servant, that you should**  - This is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]].  Here the "your" and "you" both refer only to David since Mephibosheth is addressing him back.  See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]].
    * **on such a dead dog**  - or "on such a has-been".   The implication is that Saul's kingdom is history in the same way that a dead dog is history and that it is impossible to bring back the kingdom to Saul.  See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]
