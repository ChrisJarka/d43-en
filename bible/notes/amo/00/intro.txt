===What is Amos about?===

Amos began his work about 744 to 750 BC. He prophesied against the [[:en:obe:kt:evil|wicked]] ways of the kingdom of Israel even though it was prospering. Amos was called by Yahweh to leave his home and go to the Northern Kingdom. He had no authority or credentials, but there was a conflict in Israel the nature Yahweh’s Law (understood and taught) and the way that people the people of Israel in the Northern Kingdom were living their lives.
Israel was chosen from all the nations on earth to be Yahweh’s Covenant people, but while they verbally agreed with the Law of God, they were not living righteous lives. Yahweh gave to  Amos “judgment oracles” that are found in the first six chapters of the book. Amos preached these oracles. Each of them begins with the phrase, “This is what Yahweh says …” (ULB) or other translations read, “Thus says the LORD …”  There are two groupings of these oracles (according to their content). The first is found in Amos 1:1-2:16. The second grouping of oracles is found in Amos 3:1-6:14.
The last part of Amos has three visions of judgments that are soon to be handed-down, from Amos 7:1-9:15. The first is found in Amos 7:1-17; the second is found in Amos 8:1-14; and the last is in Amos 9:1-15. The final vision promises both destruction and the hope of redemption, see Amos 9:11-15, the “booth of David” would be rebuilt (meaning the Davidic monarchy would be restored).

===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Amos" may also be called the "The book about Amos" or "The sayings of Amos."


===Who wrote Amos?===

It is likely that Amos wrote this book. Amos came from a poor family—from farmers and herdsmen. They grew sycamore trees (known as sycamore fig trees to most—a food for the poorest), and he may have had cows (based on the description of him in 7:14, 15), and he was a shepherd (see 1:1). Though Amos was a farmer, he demonstrates a very thorough knowledge, even extensive understanding of the Law of Moses, but he was not formally trained. There is no record of him being ordained by another prophet. Amos is one of the most elegant and masterful of the prophets.

=== What is the meaning of the term "Israel"? ===

The name “Israel” is used in many different ways in the Bible. The descendants of Jacob, who was also named Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel. This people group developed into the unified nation of Israel. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, while the southern kingdom became known as the Kingdom of Judah. In Amos, "Israel" almost exclusively refers to the northern kingdom of Israel.
