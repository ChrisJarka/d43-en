===== Template =====

Create notes as follows:

  - **(Required)**  Write the ULB phrase that needs explanation in bold
  - **(Optional)**  Give a simple clarifying translation
      - with synonyms
      - with minor changes in syntax
  - **(Optional)**  Explain the meaning of the phrase or word. This may involve
      - figures of speech
      - discourse issues
      - grammar issues
  - **(Optional)**  Suggest alternate ways to translate the text. These involve more complex changes than the clarifying translation. Some examples are:
      - restating a metaphor as a simile
      - restating a passive construction as active
      - restating the phrase and making implicit information explicit
  - **(Optional)**  Add TA Link
  * **(1) ULB Text**  - **(2)**  Clarifying translation. **(3)**  Text meaning. **(4)**  Alternate translation suggestion. **(5)**  (See: Translation Academy Topic)
==== Comments ====

  * All Notes require **(1)**  a phrase from the ULB Text. Try to avoid single word entries. Please include the context. (Ex. for pronouns like "he", "he has promised" is better than "he")
  * The order of the appearance of these note fields is fixed.
  * The topic of the note determines which fields are optional or required.

===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.

=== Gen 06:08 ===

"But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh."

  * **(1) in the eyes of Yahweh**  - **(3)**  Although Yahweh does not have physical eyes, he sees. **(4)**  AT: "in Yahweh's sight" or "in Yahweh's thoughts." **(5)**  (See: Metonymy)
=== Act 07:43 ===

  * **(1) tabernacle of Molech**  - **(3)**  the tabernacle or tent that housed the false god Molech
=== James 4:1 ===

Where does the quarreling and disputing among yourselves come from? Does it not arise out of your evil desires that war among your fellow believers?

  * **(1) among your fellow believers?**  - **(2)**  "in your members." **(3)**  Possible meanings are 1) There is fighting among the local believers or 2) The fighting is internal, between your desire to do evil and good.

===== Special Notes (under development) =====

There are two special types of notes that are used that contain fixed text for the ULB phrase. they are **Connecting Statement:** and **General Information:**.
  * **Connecting Statement:** - This is a note that relates the current chunk to the current discourse. When present, it must be the first note and separated by a blank line from the rest of the notes unless there is also a general information note. There is only one connecting statement used per chunk.
  * **General Information:** - This is a note that addresses other discourse topics not mentioned in the connecting statement. General information notes can occur alone or immediately following the connecting statement and are separated by a blank line from the rest of the notes. There can be one or more general information notes in a chunk.

==== Format ====
  * **Connecting Statement:** - Explanation
  * **General Information:** - Explanation
