\v 8 The goat became very powerful. But when its power was very great, its horn was broken off. But four other large horns took its place. They each pointed in a different direction.

\v 7 I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him, and he struck the ram, and broke off his two horns. The ram was powerless to stand before him, but the goat knocked him down the ground, and trampled upon him. There was no one who could deliver the ram from his power.
\v 8 And the male goat became exceedingly great. But when he became  strong, the great horn was broken, and in the place of it there
grew up four conspicuous horns that pointed toward the four winds of heaven.
