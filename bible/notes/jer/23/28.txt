\v 28 Allow those false prophets to tell people their dreams, but those who have messages that really come from me should proclaim those messages faithfully. I, Yahweh, say that like straw and grain are certainly very different, my messages and the message from those false prophets are certainly very different .
\v 29 It is as though my messages burn like a fire and is like a hammer that smashes rocks into pieces when it affects someone's heart.
\p
\v 30 Therefore, I, Yahweh say, I oppose all those prophets who steal messages from each other and claim that those messages came from me.

<usfm>
\p
\v 28 The prophet who has a dream, let him report the dream. But the one to whom I have declared something, let him declare my word truthfully. What does straw have to do with grain?—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\v 29 Is not my word like fire?—this is Yahweh's declaration—and like a hammer that shatters a rock into pieces?
\v 30 So see, I am against the prophets—this is Yahweh's declaration—anyone who steals words from another person and says they come from me.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues to deliver his message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:09|23:9]] and completes in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:37|23:40]].

  * **What does straw have to do with grain?** - Straw was the worthless stems from which farmers separated the valuable grain. This question emphasizes the difference between false messages and messages from Yahweh. AT: "Straw and grain are two totally different things." or "Worthless straw is nothing like the valuable grain." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Is not my word like fire? ... and like a hammer that shatters a rock into pieces?** - Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that his word is much more powerful than the words of mere men. In that way, his word is like fire or a hammer. AT: "My word is powerful like fire ... and powerful like a hammer that shatters a rock into pieces." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I am against** - "I am opposed to"
  * **steals words from another person** - This implies that the false prophets are thieves. They are so evil that they take each other's messages without permission rather than make up their own false messages.
