===== Definition: =====

The following terms are the most common units of weight in the Bible.. The term "shekel" meant "weight" and many other weights are described in terms of the shekel. All of these weights became used for money.

  * Gerah  (1/20 of a shekel)
  * Bekah<font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>(1/2 shekel)</font>

There are different ways to translate Biblical units for measuring weights:

  - Spell the word in a way that is similar to the way the Bible term is spelled, or the way it sounds. Then give the equivalent value using a unit of measure that is known to the receptor culture. This explanation could be put in the text or in a note.
  - Directly use the equivalent amount in terms of the unit of measure that is known to the receptor culture, without using the Bible name.
