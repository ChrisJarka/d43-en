===== Grammar Topics =====

Grammar has two main parts: words and structure. Structure involves how we put words together to form phrase, clauses, and sentences.

**Parts of Speech** - All words in a language belong to a category called a  part of speech.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech]])\\ 

**Sentences** -  When we speak, we organize our thoughts in sentences. A sentence usually has a complete thought about an event or a situation or state of being. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences]])\\ 
  * Sentences can be statements, questions, commands or exclamations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentencetypes]])
  * Sentences can have more than one clause. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences]])
  * Some languages have both active and  passive sentences (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

**Possession** - This shows that there is a relationship between two nouns. In English it is marked with "of" as in "the love of God," or with "'s" as in "God's love," or with a possessive pronoun as in "his love." (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_possession]])

**Quotations** -  A quotation is a report of what someone else has said.  \\ 
  * Quotations normally have two parts: Information about who said something and what the person said. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_quotations]]) \\ 
  * Quotations can be either direct quotes or indirect quotes  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])\\ 
  * Quotes can have quotes within them (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotesinquotes]])  
  * Quotes can be marked to make it easy for readers to understand who said what. (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotemarks]])
