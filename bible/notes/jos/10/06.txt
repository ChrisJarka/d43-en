\v 6 And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not your hand from your servants; come up to us
quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together
against us.
\v 7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
