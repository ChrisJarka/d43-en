<usfm>
\q
\v 4 In whose eyes a reprobate is despised,
\q But who honoreth them that fear Jehovah;
\q He that swears to his own hurt, and changes not;
\q
\v 5 He that puts not out his money to interest,
\q Nor takes reward against the innocent.
\q He that does these things shall never be moved.
</usfm>
