\v 14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.
\v 15 And the men that have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were
naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the
feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to their brethren: then they returned to
Samaria.
