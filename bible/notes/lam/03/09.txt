===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He blocked my path** - The author speaks of God causing him to continue to suffer as if God was preventing him from escaping the suffering by blocking his path. AT: "It is as though he blocked my path" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a wall of hewn stone** - "a wall of cut stones." People would cut stones into regular shapes that could fit together well in order to build a strong wall. 
  * **he made my paths crooked** - Crooked paths do not lead people to where they want to go. Here they represent unsuccessful ways of escaping suffering. AT: "it is as though he has made my paths crooked" or "I have tried to make the suffering stop, but God has prevented me, like one who prevents another from escaping by making his paths crooked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He is like a bear waiting to ambush me, a lion in hiding** - The author speaks of God being ready to cause him to suffer more, as if God were a wild animal waiting to attack him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he turned aside my paths** - Possible meanings are 1) "he dragged me off the path" or 2) "he caused my path to turn in the wrong direction"
  * **he has made me desolate** - "he has made me hopeless" or "he has not allowed me to have any help"
