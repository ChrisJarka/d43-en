\v 17 So I determined to learn more about being wise, and also to learn about doing things that are very stupid and foolish. But I found out that trying to understand those things was also useless, like chasing the wind.

\v 16 I spoke with my heart, saying, "Behold, I have acquired greater wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem; my heart saw how great  wisdom and knowledge was."
\v 17 And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.
\v 18 For in much wisdom is much grief, and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow.
