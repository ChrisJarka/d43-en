\v 26 Nevertheless Saul spoke not anything that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is
not clean.
\v 27 And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was
the second day, that Davidâ€™s place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Wherefore comes not the son
of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?
