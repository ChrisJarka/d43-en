\v 18 \add You people of Babylonia need to know that your\add* idols are completely \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* useless,

\q
\v 18 What does the carved figure profit you? For the one who has carved it, or who casts a figure from molten metal, is a teacher of lies;
\q for he trusts his own handiwork when he makes these mute gods.
\q
\v 19 'Woe to the one saying to the wood, Wake up! Or to the silent stone, Arise!' Do these things teach?
\q See, it is overlaid with gold and silver, but there is no breath at all within it.
\q
\v 20 But Yahweh is in his holy temple! Be silent before him, all the land."
