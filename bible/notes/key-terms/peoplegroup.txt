====== people group, nation ======

===== Definition: =====

A "people group" usually refers to a group of people who are descended from the same ancestor. They usually share a common language and culture,

  * People groups often live together in a particular land or country.
  * A people group may be made up of a single tribe, or of many tribes.
  * The term "people group" can sometimes be translated as "nation," but these two terms do not always mean the same thing. Sometimes "nation" means "country" whereas the term "people group" is focused on the people and their culture.
  * Sometimes the term "people" is used alone to mean "people group." For example "your people" refers to that person's people group.
