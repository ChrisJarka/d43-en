\v 23 Not only \add do those things groan\add*, but we ourselves also groan inwardly. We who have \add God's\add* Spirit, who is like a partial gift \f + \ft metaphor \f* we have received as we wait for \add the future glory, groan inwardly\add*. We groan while we wait eagerly for the time when we will receive our \add full\add* rights as God's adopted children. That \add will include\add* his freeing our bodies \add from the things that hinder us on earth. He will do this by giving us new bodies\add*.
\v 24 Ever since we were saved \f + \ft Or:since \add God\add* saved us \f*, we have continued to confidently expect \add that future glory\add*. If we had what we waited for, we would not \add need to\add* wait for it any longer, because those who have something, certainly do not continue to wait for it!\f + \ft Or: will they continue to wait for it? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 25 But because we keep waiting expectantly to receive what we do not yet have, we wait for it eagerly and patiently\f + \ft Or: perseveringly \f*.

\v 23 Not only do those things groan, but we ourselves also groan inwardly. We who have God's Spirit, who is like a partial gift  we have received as we wait for the future glory, groan inwardly. We groan while we wait eagerly for the time when we will receive our full rights as God's adopted children. That will include his freeing our bodies from the things that hinder us on earth. He will do this by giving us new bodies.
\v 24 Ever since we were saved
\v 25 But because we keep waiting expectantly to receive what we do not yet have, we wait for it eagerly and patiently.

\v 23 But not only so but even ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for our adoption, the redemption of our body.
\v 24 For in hope were we saved. But hope that is seen is not hope, for who hopes for what he sees?
\v 25 But if we hope for what we do not see, then we wait with patience.
