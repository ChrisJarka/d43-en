\v 37 And I will take thee, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desireth, and shall be king over Israel.
\v 38 And it shall be, if you will listen to all that I command thee, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right
in mine eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will build you a
