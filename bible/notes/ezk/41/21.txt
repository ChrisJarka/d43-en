\v 21 The temple gate posts were square, and the front of the sanctuary appeared like the temple’s appearance.
\v 22 The wooden altar was three cubits high and its length was two cubits. Its corner posts and its length and its frame was wood. Then he declared to me, “This is the table that sits before Yahweh.”
\v 23 There were two doors for the temple and sanctuary,
\v 24 and the two doors had two hinged door panels per door, two panels for one door and two panels for the other.

===== Important Terms: =====

  * altar
  * cubits -- see biblical measurements

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **"he"**  - This is the man whose appearance was like brass (40:3).
  * **"hinged"**  - I assume this is a basic principle of physics, but perhaps not.
  * **"doors" and "door panels"** - UDB uses "doorways" and "doors" instead.  Which is it?
