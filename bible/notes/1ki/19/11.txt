\v 11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And, behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong
wind tore the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before Jehovah; but Jehovah was not in the wind: and after the wind an
earthquake; but Jehovah was not in the earthquake:
