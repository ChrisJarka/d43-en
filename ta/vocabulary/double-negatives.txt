<font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>The usual negatives in the English language are "not" and the prefix "un."  The typical pattern of a double negative sentence is a negative form of a verb (cannot, did not) used with a negative adverb (i.e. unhappy), negative pronoun (i.e. no one) or a negative conjunction (i.e. neither, nor).</font>

<font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Most of the time, a double negative statement is not the best way to express something.  Double negatives can be vague.</font>

For example:  To say, "It is not unlikely" may mean "It is likely." or "It could happen."

There may be times when a vague statement is desired or preferred.  An example might be "She was not unattractive."

However, some double negations are simply incorrect.  For someone to say "I didn't see nothing" is both wrong and likely to be contrary to what the speaker intended to say.  The double negation (not and nothing) actually says "I saw something" because the speaker is saying they did not see 'nothing.'  In all likelihood, the speaker intended to say, "I didn't see anything."  Another example of incorrect grammar would be "I haven't no money."  The speaker likely intended to say "I have no money or I don't have any money."

Making positive statements will protect from double negative errors.  "I have none" uses a positive verb with a negative object.  "I want nothing" is a similar form.  Should you prefer to use the negative with the verb, these sentence would be stated "I do not have any"--with any being a positive quantity.  Or I do not want anything--again the negation has been placed with the verb and the object states a positive quantity.
