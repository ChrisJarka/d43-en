\v 28 But because it is God's Spirit who enables me to drive out demons, that proves that God is beginning to show himself as king.
\p
\v 29 I will show you why I am able to drive out demons. A person cannot go into the house of a strong man like Satan and carry off his possessions if he does not first tie up  that strong man. But if he ties him up, then he will be able to take his possessions.
\p
\v 30 No one can be neutral. Those who do not acknowledge that the Holy Spirit enables me to expel demons are opposing me, and those who do not gather people to become my disciples are causing those people to go away from me.

\v 28 But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
\v 29 And how can anyone enter the house of the strong man and take his belongings without tying up the strong man first? Then he will steal his belongings from his house. 
\v 30 The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters.
