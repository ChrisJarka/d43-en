====== I, Yahweh; me, Yahweh ======

===== Definition: =====

Many times in the Old Testament, when God is speaking about himself, he uses his name instead of a pronoun.

  * For example, instead of saying, "Honor me," he says, "Honor Yahweh." 
  * To make it clear that God is the one talking about himself, the ULB often translates this by adding a pronoun such as in, "Honor me, Yahweh" or "I, Yahweh say."
  * By adding the pronoun "I" or "me," the ULB indicates to the reader that God is the speaker.


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * To make it clear who is speaking, some languages may only use a pronoun with Yahweh one or two times at the beginning of a particular portion of text, but then omit the pronoun in the rest of that section. An example of this in the ULB is Deuteronomy 5:6-16.
  * Some translators may prefer to just follow the literal text and use "Yahweh" but not add a pronoun.
  * Others may choose to only use the pronoun; however, it is best if possible to keep the name Yahweh in the text.
  * Whatever way it is translated, people should be able to understand that Yahweh is talking about himself and it should sound natural in their language. If at all possible it should retain the word "Yahweh."
  * This is a summary of possible ways to translate a phrase like, "Yahweh your God":
     * "Yahweh your God"
     * "I [Me], Yahweh your God"
     * "I" [Me]"
