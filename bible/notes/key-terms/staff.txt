====== staff ======

===== Definition: =====

A biblical shepherd's staff was a long rod used to guide wandering sheep closer to the shepherd or to help a ewe with birthing young. <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>.</font>

  * Some ancient petroglyphs show a man holding a staff with a hook on the end.
  * Modern shepherds say if the shepherd touches a newborn lamb with his hands, the ewe may no longer accept the lamb as her own for care and feeding, due to confusion of body scents.
