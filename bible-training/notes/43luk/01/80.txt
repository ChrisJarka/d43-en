===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **kept growing**  - That is, "grew up (and became a man)." The translation of this should make it clear that he was no longer a child when he lived out in the deserted regions.
    * **became strong in spirit**  - That is, "developed a strong moral character" or "grew stronger in his relationship with God."
    * **until** - This does not necessarily mark a stopping point. John lived out  continued to live out in the desert even after he started preaching publicly. So it may be more clear to say, "even up to the time when".
    * **appear publicly**  - This could be translated as "go before" or "preach in public." "
