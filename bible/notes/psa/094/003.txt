===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked rejoice?** - The psalmist repeats the question to show that he is unhappy with how long Yahweh has allowed the wicked to rejoice. AT: "Yahweh, you have waited too long; you have waited too long to stop the wicked from rejoicing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **will the wicked rejoice** - Why the wicked rejoice can be stated clearly. AT: "will the wicked rejoice because you never punish them for the evil deeds they do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **They pour out arrogant and defiant speeches** - The psalmist speaks of words as if they were a liquid. AT: "The wicked people say many arrogant things and defy you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
