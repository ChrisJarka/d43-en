====== Babel ======

===== Facts: =====

Babel was a chief city in a region called Shinar which later was called Babylonia in the southern part of Mesopotamia.

  * The city of Babel was founded by Ham's great grandson, Nimrod who ruled the region of Shinar.
  * God had told the people to spread out and live in different parts of the world, but instead they decided to stay together in Shinar and try to build a tower high enough to reach heaven. This later became known as the "Tower of Babel."
  * Because the people living in Shinar were proud and refused to spread out as God had commanded, he confused their languages so that they could not understand one another. This forced them to be scattered across the earth.
  * The root meaning of the word for "Babel" is "confusion," named for when God confused the people's language.
