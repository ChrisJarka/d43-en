====== Philippians 03:8-11 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 8 More than that, I consider all things to be worthless, compared to how great it is to know Christ Jesus my Lord. Because I \add want to know\add* him \add better\add* \f + \ft Or: In order that I \add may know\add* him \add better\add* \f*, I have rejected all things as worthless. I consider them \add as useless as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* rubbish, in order that I may have \add a close relationship with\add* Christ \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \v 9 and in order that I may completely belong to him. It was not as a result of \add my obeying\add* the laws \add he gave Moses\add* that God erased the record of my sins. Instead, it is because I have trusted in Christ \add that God\add* has declared the guilt for my sins to be ended and he enables me to act righteously. \add It is\add* God \add himself who\add* has erased the record of my sins, and he enables me to act righteously, \add only\add* because I have trusted \add in Christ\add*. \v 10 I \add want\add* to know Christ \add better and better\add*. Particularly, I \add want\add* to continually experience \add his working\add* powerfully in me\f + \ft Or: my life \f*, \add just like God worked powerfully when he\add* caused Christ to become alive after he died. I \add also want to be continually willing\add* to suffer \add in order that I may obey God\add*, just like Christ suffered \add in order that he might obey God. I also want\add* to be completely willing to die for \add Christ\add*, even as he died for me, \v 11 \add because I expect that, as a result of God's goodness\add*, he will cause me to live again after I have died.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 8 Instead, even more I now consider all things as not only worthless, but as useless garbage to throw away, compared to how great it is to know Christ Jesus my Lord. I have removed from my life everything worthless, in order to benefit from Christ. \v 9 I now belong completely to Christ. I know that I cannot make myself good in God's sight by keeping the Law. Instead I trust totally in Christ, so God has declared me good in His sight. \v 10 When God declared me good in his sight, he did this so that I could begin to know Christ; so that God could begin to work in me with the same power with which he raised Christ from the dead; so that I could begin to suffer along with Christ as he suffered; and so that Christ could make me more like him when he died. \v 11 All of this is because I fully expect that God will cause me to live again, as he has promised.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 8 In fact, now I count all things to be loss because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have discarded all things; I consider them garbage so that I may gain Christ. \v 9 And now I am found in him; I do not have a righteousness of my own from the law. Instead, I have the righteousness from God that is through faith in Christ. \v 10 It is a righteousness of knowing him, the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferingsâ€“and I am transformed by Christ into the likeness of his death, \v 11 so somehow I may experience the resurrection from the dead. </usfm>
