====== test ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "test" refers to causing people to experience difficult or painful things in order to find out how strong or faithful they are. 

  * Tests are sometimes called "trials."
  * God sometimes uses tests to expose people's sin. A test helps a person to turn away from sin and to draw closer to God.
  * God also sometimes uses tests people to show that they are trusting him.
  * To "put to the test" can mean, "challenge something or someone to prove its value."
  * Jesus told Satan that it is wrong to put God to the test. He is the almighty, holy God who is above everything and everyone.
  * Unlike God, Satan does not simply test people, but instead he tempts them to sin.


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * This can also be translated as "challenge."
