\v 27 Think about the way that flowers grow \add in the fields\add*. They do not work \add to earn money\add*, and they do not make their own clothes. But I tell you that \add even though King\add* Solomon, \add who lived long ago, wore very beautiful clothes\add*, his clothes were not as beautiful as one of those \add flowers\add*.
\v 28 God makes the flowers beautiful, but they grow in the fields for only a short time. Then \add they are cut at the same time that the other grass\add* is cut, and thrown into an oven \add to be burned to make heat for baking\add* bread. \add So they really are not worth very much. But you are very precious to\add* God, \add and he\add* will \add care for you\add* much more \add than he cares for the grass by filling it with beautiful flowers\add*. So he will certainly provide clothes for you, who \add live much longer than the grass. Why\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add do you\add* trust him so little?

\v 27 Think about the way that flowers grow. They do not work to earn money and they do not make their own clothes. But I tell you that even though King Solomon, who lived long ago, wore very beautiful clothes, he was never as well dressed as one of those flowers.
\v 28 God makes the plants beautiful even though they grow for only a short time. Then they are cut and thrown into the fire. But you are very precious to God, and he will care for you much more than he cares for the plants. Why do you trust him so little?

\v 27 Consider the lilies - how they grow: they do not labor, neither do they spin; yet I say to you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.
\v 28 If God so clothes the grass in the field, which exists today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples not to worry about food and possessions.)
    * **neither do they spin**  - or, "nor do they make yarn to make cloth"
    * **lilies**  - Lilies are beautiful flowers. If your language does not have a word for lily, you could use the name of another beautiful flower that grows wildly in the fields. Or you could simply translate it as "flowers."
