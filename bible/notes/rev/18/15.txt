<usfm>
\v 15 The merchants of these things who became rich by her shall stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,
\v 16 saying, "Woe, woe, the great city, she who was dressed in fine linen, purple, scarlet, and covered with gold and precious stone and pearl."
\v 17 In one hour so many riches were laid waste. Therefore every ship captain, every passenger and
sailor, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood at a distance.
