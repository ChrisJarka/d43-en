\v 19 No blacksmith could be found throughout all of Israel, because the Philistines said, "Otherwise the Hebrews make swords or spears for themselves."
\v 20 But all the men of Israel went down to the Philistines, each to sharpen his plow points, his mattock , and his axe, and
his sickle;
\v 21 The charge was two-tirds of a sheckel for the plow points, and the mattocks, and a third of a sheckel for sharpening axes, and setting the goads.
