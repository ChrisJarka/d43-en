====== mediator ======

===== Definition: =====

A mediator is a person who helps two enemy parties resolve their differences and become reconciled.

  * Since people have sinned against God, the relationship they had with him was broken. Jesus is the mediator between God the Father and people, restoring that broken relationship through his payment for their sin.
  * Reconciliation was made possible because of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, taking the punishment for sin that people deserved.
  * Ways to translate "mediator" could be, "go-between person" or "reconciler" or "person who brings peace."
