====== Decimal Numbers ======

//This module answers the question:  Why is there a mark between two numbers, such as 2.5?//

The decimal point, or decimal comma, is a mark placed to the left of a number to show that the number refers to a part of a whole number. For example .1 meter is not a whole meter but is only one tenth of a meter. And .5 meter is not five meters, but is only five tenths of a meter. 3.7 meters is three and seven tenths of a meter. Numbers like these are used in the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB).

==== Description ====

The decimal point, or decimal comma, is a mark placed to the left of a number to show that the number refers to part of a whole number. For example .1 meter is not a whole meter but is only one tenth of a meter. And 3.7 meters is three and seven tenths of a meter.

In some countries people use a decimal point, and in other countries people use a decimal comma. So translators in countries that use a decimal comma would write “3.7 meters” as “3,7 meters.” In some cultures people prefer fractions. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_fraction]])

In the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB) parts of a number are written as decimals or fractions. When they are used with a measurement such as meters, grams, and liters, the are usually written as decimals. 

=== Decimal Numbers That Are Used in the UDB ===
^ Decimal ^ Fraction ^ Simpler Fraction^ \\ 
|.1 |one tenth |  | 
|.2 |two tenths | one fifth | 
|.3 |three tenths |  | 
|.4 |four tenths | two fifths| 
|.5 |five tenths | one half | 
|.6 |six tenth | three fifths | 
|.7 |seven tenths |   | 
|.8 |eight tenths | four fifths | 
|.9 |nine tenths |  | 
|.25 |twenty-five one hundredths | one fourth | 
|.75 |seventy-five one hundredths | three fourths|\\

==== Examples from the Bible ====

For telling about parts of a number, the Unlocked Literal Bible (ULB) uses fractions, and the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB) uses decimals. Another difference between the ULB and the UDB is that when measuring [[en:obe:other:biblicaldistance]], [[en:obe:other:biblicalweight]], and [[en:obe:other:biblicalvolume]], they use different systems, so the numbers in the ULB and the UDB are not the same for these measures.

>They are to make an ark of acacia wood. Its length must be __two and a half cubits__; its width will be __one cubit and a half__; and its height will be __one cubit and a half__.  (Exodus 25:10 ULB)
The ULB uses the fraction "half." This can also be written as a decimal: .5. 

>Tell the people to make a sacred chest from acacia wood. It is to be __one meter__ long, __0.7 meter wide__, and __0.7 meter__ high.(Exodus 25:10 UDB)\\ 
The UDB uses the decimal 0.7. This equals seven tenths.


===== Translation Strategies =====

  * Decide whether you want to use only fractions, only decimals, or a combination of the two.  
  * Decide whether you want to use the measures given in the ULB or the UDB or some other kind of measures.
  * If you decide to use fractions and the measures in the ULB, simply translate the numbers and measures in the  ULB.
  * If you decide to use decimals and the measures in the UDB, simply translate the numbers and measures in the UDB.

  - If you decide to use decimals and the measures in the ULB, you will need to change the fractions in the ULB to decimals.
  - If you decide to use fractions and the measures in the UDB, you will need to change the decimals in the UDB to fractions.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. If you decide to use decimals and the measures in the ULB, you will need to change the fractions in the ULB to decimals.

  * **On the eighth day he must take two male lambs without blemish, one female lamb a year old without blemish, and __three tenths of an ephah__ of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and __one log__ of oil.** (Leviticus 14:10 ULB)
   * "On the eighth day he must take two male lambs without blemish, one female lamb a year old without blemish, and __0.3 ephah__ of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and __one log__ of oil."\\

2. If you decide to use fractions and the measures in the UDB, you will need to change the decimals in the UDB to fractions.
  * **The next day that person must bring two male lambs and one female lamb; the female lamb must be one year old, and the animals must have no defects. He must also bring __about 6.5 liters__ of a fine flour offering, mixed with olive oil, to be an offering, and about __one third liter__ of olive oil.** (Leviticus 14:10 UDB)\\
    * "On the eighth day he must take two male lambs without blemish, one female lamb a year old without blemish, and __six and half liters__ of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and __one third liter__ of oil."\\
 



 
      * “Someone must also provide each morning an offering of flour. It must be __about 3.5 liters__ of flour mixed with one liter of olive oil.”\\ (Ezekiel 46:14 UDB)\\
    * “**And you will give a grain offering with it morning after morning, __a sixth of an ephah__ and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour of the grain offering for Yahweh, according to a permanent statute.**”\\ (Ezekiel 46:14 ULB)
