    * **into Abraham's bosom** - The bosom is the place at the chest where a fold is created by a loose garment. This could also be translated as "to Abraham's side" or "to be with Abraham" or "to rest by Abraham's chest." This was a place of security and happiness.  
    * **place of the dead**  -
    * **being in torment**  - That is, "while he was in torment" or "while he was suffered he suffered severe pain."
