===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Has Yahweh struck Jacob and Israel as he struck those nations who struck them **- Yahweh uses a question to deny Israel's complaint that he is punishing them in the same way that he punished their enemies.   His judgement on other nations will be more severe. "Has Yahweh punished Israel as he punished the nations who attacked Israel?"  (See Rhetorical Question)
  * **or have Jacob and Israel been killed as the slaughter of those nations that were killed by them? **- Again Yaheweh says that Israel has not been punished without purpose.  (See: Doublet)
  * **In exact measure **- The punishment is carefully adjusted to the degree of the offence. "Exact measure" could also mean in moderation.
  * **sending Jacob and Israel away he drove them away with his severe wind, on the day of the east wind - ** sending the people of Israel away here means Yahweh has inflicted his judgement or punishment on the people. Yahweh's power is described here as a **"**severe wind" and "east wind". Alternate translation "Yahweh, in his great power, has punished the people of Israel"
