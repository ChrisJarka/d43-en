\v 3 This is what Yahweh says:
\q "For three sins of Damascus,
\q even for four,
\q I will not turn away punishment,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For three sins of ... even for four** - This poetic device is not meant to imply that a specific number of sins have been committed, but to communicate that an abundance of sins have led to Godâ€™s judgment.
  * **I will not turn away punishment** - Yahweh uses two negatives here for emphasis. AT: "I will certainly punish those people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **they threshed Gilead with instruments of iron** - Yahweh speaks of how Damascus treated Gilead as if they were threshing grain with iron tools or weapons. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I will send a fire into the house of Hazael** - Here Yahweh speaks of his judgment against the house of Hazael as if it was a consuming fire. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the house of Hazael** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to Hazael's descendants, who were rulers of Damascus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **it will devour the fortresses of Ben Hadad** - Here Yahweh's judgment is spoken of as if it was fire was. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Hazael ... Ben Hadad** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
