====== Ellipsis ======

Ellipsis is a type of implied information that occurs when the structure of the language permits, requires, or prefers that certain information be omitted in order to be natural and accurate. The information that is omitted has usually already been stated in a preceding sentence or phrase. It is important to understand what words have been omitted in the source text in order to:


◾ understand the complete meaning of the text.



◾ accurately and naturally express that meaning in the receptor language.



◾ think specifically about which information needs to be left implied and which information should be made explicit in the receptor language when translating.

===== Examples from English =====

In the following sentence, "//John can play the guitar and Mary can, too", t//he action that Mary does has been omitted because that is a natural way to express this in English. If the implied information is made explicit, the sentence would be, "//John can play the guitar and Mary can **play the guitar**, too". // Some languages may need to include this implied information in order for the meaning to be clear.
===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Luke 18:40-41**
//Jesus stood still and commanded that the man be brought to him. Then when the blind man was near, Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?" He said, "Lord, that I might receive my sight."//

**that I might receive my sight** - This is an elliptical expression. It is not a full sentence, but its meaning can be understood from the context as “I want to receive my sight” or “Do something so that I might receive my sight.”  Another alternate which would be even more explicit: “Lord, would you please enable me to see?” (or Lord, I would like you to heal me so that I can see). 

**Luke 21:10** 
//Then he said to them, "Nations will rise against other nations, and kingdoms against other kingdoms."// 

Some languages may need to include the implied information and say, "//Then he said to them, "Nations will rise against other nations, and kingdoms **will rise** against other kingdoms."//The phrase "will rise" is not made explicit in Greek or English because it is understood without it.
