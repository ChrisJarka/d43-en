<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh said to Ezekiel, "Son of man, give a message about the hill country and mountains in Israel. Speak to them, just as if they were people. Tell them to listen to my message for them.
\v 2 This is it: the enemies of Israel, those people-groups who live nearby, are now very happy, because they are saying that Jerusalem has been destroyed, so the hill country and mountains of Israel will now belong to them.
\v 3 So you, Ezekiel, must tell the mountains of Israel what I, the Lord Yahweh, am saying to them: 'Armies of other nations attacked you from every direction, and everyone has left you. Those foreign armies are now in your land. They have spoken very maliciously about your people, the Israelites, and have told all kinds of lies about them.
