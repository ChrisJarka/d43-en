\v 1 I, Paul, am writing this letter. Sosthenes, our fellow believer, is with me as I write it. God appointed me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and God chose me to serve him.
\v 2 This letter is to the church of God in Corinth: to those who have been set apart for God, called 'holy ones,' with everyone else--everwhere--who calls on God to save them in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is their Lord and ours.  
\p
\v 3 May God's gracious love and his saving mercy come to you, along with the peace that you have from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
