====== Ecclesiastes 05:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Do not let the things that you promise to do cause you to sin by not doing them. And \add when you promise God to do something and do not do it\add*, do not say to God's priest that is was a mistake for you to promise to do that. If you do that, God will certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* become very angry with you, and he will take from you everything that you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* have worked to acquire.
\v 7 Promising to do something and not doing it is like \f + \ft simile \f* a dream that has no value; instead, revere God \add by doing what you promised him that you would do\add*.

<usfm>
\v 6 Suffer not your mouth to cause your flesh to sin; neither say you before the angel, that is was an error: wherefore should
God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?
\v 7 For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, and in many words: but fear you God.
