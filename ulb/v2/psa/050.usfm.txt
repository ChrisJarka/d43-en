\c 50
\d A Psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, has spoken,
\q And called the earth from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof.
\q
\v 2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
\q God has shined forth.
\q
\v 3 Our God cometh, and does not keep silence:
\q A fire devours before him,
\q And it is very tempestuous round about him.
\q
\v 4 He calls to the heavens above,
\q And to the earth, that he may judge his people:
\q
\v 5 Gather my saints together to me,
\q Those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
\q
\v 6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness;
\q For God is judge himself. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak;
\q O Israel, and I will testify to thee:
\q I am God, even your God.
\q
\v 8 I will not reprove you for your sacrifices;
\q And your burnt offerings are continually before me.
\q
\v 9 I will take no bullock out of your house,
\q Nor he-goats out of your folds.
\q
\v 10 For every beast of the forest is mine,
\q And the cattle upon a thousand hills.
\q
\v 11 I know all the birds of the mountains;
\q And the wild beasts of the field are mine.
\q
\v 12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee;
\q For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
\q
\v 13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls,
\q Or drink the blood of goats?
\q
\v 14 Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving;
\q And pay your vows to the Most High;
\q
\v 15 And call upon me in the day of trouble:
\q I will deliver thee, and you shall glorify me.
\b
\q
\v 16 But to the wicked God saith,
\q What have you to do to declare my statutes,
\q And that you have taken my covenant in your mouth,
\q
\v 17 Seeing that you hate instruction,
\q And throw my words behind thee?
\q
\v 18 When you saw a thief, you consentedst with him,
\q And have been partaker with adulterers.
\q
\v 19 You give your mouth to evil,
\q And your tongue frameth deceit.
\q
\v 20 You sit and speak against your brother;
\q You slanderest your own motherâ€™s son.
\q
\v 21 These things have you done, and I kept silence;
\q You thought that I was altogether such a one as thyself:
\q But I will reprove thee, and set them in order before your eyes.
\b
\q
\v 22 Now consider this, you that forget God,
\q Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver:
\q
\v 23 Whoso offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me;
\q And to him that ordereth his way aright
\q Will I show the salvation of God.
