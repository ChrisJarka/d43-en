\v 18 What does the carved figure profit you? For the one who has carved it, and form his cast figure from molten metal, he is a teacher of lies,
\q since the former trusts his own form when he makes these mute gods.
\q
\v 19 'Woe to the one saying to the wood, Wake up! Or to the silent stone, Arise!' Do these things teach? 
\q See, it is overlaid with gold and silver, but there is no breath at all within it.
\q
\v 20 But Yahweh is in his holy temple! Be silent before him, all the land!"

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **"you"**  - the word "you" refers to Babylonians/Chaldeans.
    * **"he is a teacher of lies"** - This phrase refers to the carved/cast idols.
    * **"the former trusts his own form"** - The idol maker makes the idol in his own image.
    * **"these mute gods"** - English translations refer to a false god using a small “g” and write God with a large “G” when referring to the one true God. Other languages may also choose to do that. Another option would be to use a different word to refer to the false gods.
