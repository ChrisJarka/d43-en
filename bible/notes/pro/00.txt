===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**What is meant by "wisdom" and "foolishness" in the Book of Proverbs?**

Here "wisdom" means first the humility necessary to live in a way that honors Yahweh. Anyone living in this way will also learn to live well with other people and to make good practical decisions in life. The Book of Proverbs also acknowledges that it is important to maintain one's honor, that is, one's good reputation in the opinion of other people. Those who fail to live in this way are called "foolish." For this reason, it is possible for a person to be very intelligent and still to be foolish.
