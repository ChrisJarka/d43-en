<usfm>
\v 37 This statement is true: one person plants the seeds, and another person harvests the crops.

  * [[:en:obe:kt:true]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:harvest]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:labor]] 

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues speaking to his disciples.

  * **One sows, and another harvests** - The words "sows" and "harvests" are metaphors. The one who "sows" shares the message of Jesus. The one who "harvests" helps the people to receive the message of Jesus. AT: "One person plants the seeds, and another person harvests the crops." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you yourselves have entered into their labor** - The reflexive pronoun "yourselves" emphasizes the word "you." Translate this in the way that your language emphasizes a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
