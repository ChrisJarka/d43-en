\v 12 I am happy \add to say\add* that I have behaved toward all people \f + \ft metonymy \f* in an honest and sincere way. I am sure within myself \add that this is true\add*. Especially, I have behaved toward you \add honestly and sincerely because that is what\add* God wants us to do. As I have done that, \add my thoughts\add* have not been the thoughts that unbelieving people \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add think are\add* wise. Instead, \add I have behaved toward people only as God wants me to, depending on\add* God to help me in ways that I do not deserve.
\v 13 \add I say that\add* because \add in all my letters to you\add* I have always written \f + \ft litotes \f* clearly in a way that you can easily and completely understand \add when you\add* read them.
\v 14 \add Previously some of\add* you, but not all of you, have completely understood \add that I am always honest and sincere with you\add*. But I confidently expect that \add soon\add* you will all be fully convinced \add about that\add*. Then when the Lord Jesus \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add returns, you will all be able to say that\add* you are pleased with me, just like I will \add be able to say that\add* I am pleased with you.

\v 12   We are happy to say that we have behaved toward all people in an honest and sincere way. We agree that this is true. Especially, we have lived in the world as people who are set apart for God and we have a honesty about what we believe that comes only from God. Our lives do not follow the style of life the world wants us to live. We do not follow the wisdom of this world in making decisions about how we live, but live by God's loving gifts that fill our lives, and you see him working in us as we live with you.
\v 13 You read my letters. I have always written them so you can understand them.
\v 14 Most of you know that I am completely honest and sincere when I live with you. The more you know us, the more you will trust us. Then on the day when the Lord Jesus returns, you will proud of the way we have lived our lives before God, and we will be proud of how you have lived your lives before God.

\v 12 Now this is our boast:  the testimony of our conscience that  we conducted ourselves  in the world with holiness and sincerity that are from God, not according to earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and even more toward you.
\v 13 We do not write to you anything you cannot read or understand--and I hope that
\v 14 as you already understand us in part,  that on the day of our Lord Jesus, you will boast of us as we will boast of you.
