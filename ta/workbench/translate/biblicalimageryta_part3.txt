====== Biblical Imagery - Cultural Models ======
===== Description =====


The Scriptures employ cultural models, which can be described as systems of thought that are more elaborate and more developed than metaphorical patterns and metonymies. Some of these models, at least, were used extensively in the Ancient Near East, and not only among the Israelites.

=== Model of THEOPHANY (GOD REVEALING HIMSELF) ===

Psalm 18:7-14 

=== Model of GOD as a HUMAN BEING ===

Although the Scriptures explicitly deny that God is a human being, he is often spoken of as performing human actions and having human emotions, etc. This kind of language is so general that the God-human model is often overlooked. Nevertheless, when the Scriptures say that God speaks, we are not to imagine, for example, that he has vocal chords that vibrate. Neither is it the case that when the Scriptures present us with language like the following (e.g., //The hand of God also came on Judah, to give them one heart to carry out the command of the king and leaders by the word of Yahweh//  –2 Chron. 30:12) , we are to attribute to God a physical hand.

We commonly say that //hand //  here is a case of metonymy. Certainly metonymy is involved in this case, but the figure of speech in 1 Chron. 30:12 must involve more than metonymy only. The notion of inducing //hand of God //  to represent divine agency and power can work only if the hand itself can be attributed to God, where //hand //  is then used as a metonym for //God//. But //hand //  cannot be **literally **  attributed to God, so it must be **metaphorically **  attributed to him. On what basis? On the only possible basis: on the model of God as a human being.

Consequently, we must regard //the hand of God//  in its sense of divine agency and power as actually an example of a **combination of a model, metonym, //and //  underlying metaphor**, rather than as a simple metonym. The model is **God as a human being**, the metonym is **hand standing for God**, and the underlying metaphor is** hand representing agency and power**.

=== Model of GOD as a WARRIOR ===

>For you will turn them back; you will draw your bow before them. (Psalm 21:12 ULB)

=== Model of GOD as a KING ===

=== THE WILDERNESS AS A MODEL FOR DISTRESSING SITUATIONS ===
[[Jim, could this be reworded to this - Model of a DISTRESSING SITUATION as a WILDERNESS]]


=== CONTAINMENT MODEL OF THE SUN AT NIGHT ===
[[Jim, could this be reworded to this - Model of the SUN as BEING IN A CONTAINER AT NIGHT?]]

>Yet their words go out over all the earth and their speech to the end of the world. He has pitched a tent for the sun among them. The sun is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and like a strong man who rejoices when he runs his race. (Psalm 19:4-5 ULB)

>from the womb of the dawn your youth will be to you like the dew.  (Psalm 110:3c ULB)
This pictures the sun as being in the womb before it comes out in the morning. 

=== Model of BLOOD as LIFE ===

In this model, the blood of a person or an animal represents life.

>But you must not eat meat with its life—that is its blood—in it. (Genesis 9:4 ULB)

>In this way, this person would not die by the hand of the one who wanted to avenge the blood that was shed, until the accused person would first stand before the assembly. (Joshua 20:9 ULB)

      * If it is **spilled**, someone has killed.
      * If it is **poured out**, there is death.
      * If it **cries out**, nature itself is claiming vengeance (via Personification)

=== Model of a  COUNTRY as a WIFE AND of ITS GOD as her HUSBAND ===

=== Model of the WIND as FUTILITY ===

=== Model of COVENANTS ===

===Model of HUMAN WARFARE as DIVINE WARFARE===

===Model of GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES as OTHER CONSTRAINTS IN LIFE===

===Model of WELLBEING as PHYSICAL CLEANLINESS, and of EVIL as PHYSICAL DIRTINESS===

===Model of HONOR AND SHAME===

===Model of GOOD as EXISTING IN LIMITED AMOUNTS===

===Model of THE EVIL EYE===
Variations of this model are found in many parts of the world. In most of the cultures represented in the Bible, the model included the following elements:

1. People see objects, not because of ambient light reflected off them, but because of light that emerges from their eyes onto those objects. 
>The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore, if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. (Matthew 6:22 ULB)

2. This emergent light carries with itself the viewer's character. 
>The appetite of the wicked craves evil; his neighbor sees no kindness in his eyes.  (Proverbs 21:10 ULB)

> He said, "It is that which comes out of the person that defiles him. For from within a person, out of the heart, proceed evil thoughts…, envy  [lit., //an evil eye//]…. (Mark 7:20-22 ULB) [[Is this saying that "envy" is literally "an evil eye"?]]

3. The primary quality of a person with the evil eye is envy. 
>Is it not legitimate for me to do what I wish with my own possessions? Or is your eye evil because I am good? (Matthew 20:15 ULB, in a context in which the emotion of envy is present)

4. To look at a person with an evil eye is to lay a curse or enchantment on him.
>Foolish Galatians, whose evil eye has harmed you? [Lit., //who has bewitched you with the evil eye?//]. (Galatians 3:1 ULB)

Look at how these elements come together in Luke 11:33-36: [[Jim, I wonder if this is part below is going into more detail than is needed for this page.]]

>No one, after lighting a lamp, places it in a dark closet or under a basket, but on a lampstand so that those who enter may have light. (Luke 11:33 ULB)

>Your eye is the lamp of the body. (Luke 11:34a ULB) [Analogy of the eye to a lamp]

>When your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. (Luke 11:34b ULB)
Having a good eye is a sign that you have goodness within yourself.  (This also has the metaphor of LIGHT representing goodness. See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_phenom]] [[workbench page]])

>But when your eye is bad, your body is full of darkness. (Luke 11:34c ULB)
Having a bad eye is a sign that you have evil within yourself ((This also has the metaphor of DARKNESS representing evil. See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_phenom]] [[workbench page]])

>Therefore, be careful that the light in you is not darkness. (Luke 11:35 ULB) \\ 
This means ensure that you have goodness and not evil within yourself.

>If then, your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, then your whole body will be like when a lamp shines its brightness on you. (Luke 11:36 ULB)

The eye projects the goodness or evil that is inside the body onto whatever it gazes at. In this way, the eye bestows either a blessing or a curse. The following example shows the eye bestowing a blessing.
> "If I have found favor in your eyes...". (1 Samuel 27:5)

===Model of THE NATION OF ISRAEL as GOD'S SON===

>When Israel was a young man I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt.  (Hosea 11:1 ULB)
