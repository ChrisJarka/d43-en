==== Keyboard Shortcuts ====

  * **Edit**  a page – ''Alt-Shift-E''
  * **Preview**  a page (edit window) – ''Alt-Shift-P''
  * **Save**  a page (edit window) – ''Alt-Shift-S''
==== Pasting Content from Word, LibreOffice, or Web Browsers ====

If you have content in a Word document or web page that can legally be included on Door43, use the Graphical Editor (CKG Editor) and look for the "Paste from Word" button on the toolbar. (It looks like a clipboard with a W on it.)

This button opens up a dialog where you can paste formatted content (with **bold**, //italics//, etc.) and, after clicking "OK", pastes it into the page on Door43 with the formatting. Not perfect, but may help.

==== Actions to Know ====

  * **Right click on a link **  to open a new window or new tab - almost all of the links in Door43 will close the window you are in when opening the new window. Sometimes you may want to open another window so that 2, or more, are open at the same time.
  * **Duplicating the tab **- this is another way to have 2 Internet browser windows open at the same time.
  * **Arrange 2 Internet browser windows next to each other**
  * **Bookmarking or Adding to Favorites **- you may find it convenient to keep a few Door43 pages as bookmarks.
