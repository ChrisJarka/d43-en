**What is the Book of Esther about?**\\

The Book of Esther is the account of a terrible plot to kill all the Jews living in the Persian Empire. These were the descendants of the Jews whom the Babylonians had taken into exile. 

This book tells how a young Jewish woman named Esther became the queen of Persia, the most important wife of the king of Persia. The book implies that God used Esther to save her people from destruction.

The Book of Esther ends by explaining that the Jewish festival of Purim began as a celebration of God's rescue of the Jews. The name "Purim" comes from "pur," the lots or dice that the Jews' main enemy threw in order to decide on what day to begin killing them.

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
