====== [DOU] Doublet [ˈdəblət] ======

===A doublet states the same thought in two ways.===
 
**Examples from the Bible** 

Do not judge, and you will not be judged
Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Luke 6:37

This is a doublet.  Judging others and condemning others are very similar.

------------------
My soul magnifies the Lord.
My sprit has rejoiced in God my Savior.   Luke 1:46

This is a doublet. These two phrases mean basically the same thing.
------------------

Make ready the way of the Lord!\\ 
Make his paths straight! Mark 1:3b

This is a doublet. Both commands mean the same thing.
---------------------------

 But as the man went out he began to announce it publicly and spread the story widely, Mark 1:45a NET

The man went //and presented himself to the priest. But then // he began to tell many people about //how Jesus had healed him // [DOU]. Mark 1:45a (TFT)

This is a doublet. "Announce it publicly: and "spread the story widely" mean basically the same thing. The TFT expresses it once with "tell many people".
-------------------
 
For nothing is hidden except to be revealed, 
and nothing is concealed except to be brought to light. Mark 4:22, NET

//Similarly//, there are some //parts of God's message // that people do not know. //But he intends that // people will understand all the things that they do not know //now//. Mark 4:22, TFT

When Jesus spoke he used a doublet. "Nothing is hidden except to be revealed" and "nothing is concealed expect to be brought to light" mean the same thing. The TFT states this idea once with the sentence "But he intended that people will understand all the things that they do not know now."
