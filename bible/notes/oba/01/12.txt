\v 12 But look not you on the day of your brother in the day of his disaster, and rejoice not over the children of Judah in the
day of their destruction; neither speak proudly in the day of distress.
\v 13 Enter not into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, look not you on their affliction in the day of
their calamity, neither lay you hands on their substance in the day of their calamity.
\v 14 And stand you not in the crossway, to cut off those of his that escape; and deliver not up those of his that remain in
the day of distress.
