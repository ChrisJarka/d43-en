<usfm> \v 3 None of you should be concerned about someone else's small faults! That would be like noticing a speck in that person's eye. But you should be concerned about your own big faults. They are like logs in your own eye that you do not notice. \v 4 You should not say to other people about their minor faults, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye!' You should not say that if a log is still in your own eye. \v 5 You hypocrite, stop sinning in all the large ways you do. Then you will be able to help other people stop sinning in their small ways."

<usfm> \v 3 And why do you look at the speck that is in your brotherâ€™s eye, but ignore the log that is in your own? \v 4 How is it that you say to your brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye, while the log is in your own? \v 5 You hypocrite, first remove the log from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's. </usfm>
