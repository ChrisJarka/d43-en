<usfm>
\v 13 it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking
Yahwe ; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh,
saying, For he is good; for his lovingkindness endures for ever; that then the house was filled with a
cloud, even the house of Jehovah,
\v 14 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of God.
