====== Parallelism ======

===== Description =====

 
In parallelism two clauses that are similar in structure or idea are used together. There are different kinds of parallelism. Some of them are the following: 
  - The second clause or phrase means the same as the first. 
  - The second clarifies or strengthens the meaning of the first. 
  - The second completes what is said in the first. 
  - The second says something that contrasts with the first. 
Parallelism is most commonly found in all of Old Testament poetry, such as in the books of Psalms and Proverbs.  It also occurs in Greek in the New Testament, both in the four gospels and in the apostles' letters.

===== Examples from the Bible =====
1.The second clause or phrase means the same as the first. 
You make him to rule over the works of your hands; 
you have put all things under his feet (Psalm 8:6) 
Both lines say that God made man the ruler of everything. 
 
2.The second clarifies or strengthens the meaning of the first. 
The eyes of Yahweh are everywhere,  
keeping watch over the evil and the good. (Proverbs 15:3) 
The second line tells more specifically what Yahweh watches. 
 
3.The second completes what is said in the first. 
I lift up my voice to Yahweh, 
and he answers me from his holy hill. (Psalm 3:4) 
The second line tells what Yahweh does in response to what the person does in the first clause. 
 
4.The second says something that contrasts with the first. 
For Yahweh approves of the way of the righteous,  
but the way of the wicked will perish. (Psalm 1:6) 
This contrasts what happens to righteous people with what happens to wicked people. 
 
A gentle answer turns away wrath, 
but a harsh word stirs up anger.  (Proverbs 15:1) 
This contrasts what happens when someone gives a gentle answer with what happens when someone says something harsh. 
 
 
===== Translation Strategies =====
If your language can use x consider using it. These strategies are for if your language cannot use x.
For most kinds of parallelism, it is good to translate both of the clauses or phrases.  
When the two phrases mean the same thing, some languages would not translate them both. (See  Parallelism with the Same Meaning.)

  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

**Parallelism ** is the expression of one idea in two or more different ways. Parallelism is most commonly found in the book of Psalms and Proverbs but is found throughout the whole of the Hebrew Bible.
There are several reasons for parallelism in poetry:
  * Emphasizes something of great importance.
  * Much of the Hebrew text was sung and poetic writing is easier to sing.
  * Poems and songs are easier to memorize than straight texts.
===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * When a parallelism is used in poetry, a sermon, or prophecy, either keep the parallelism, or use your own culture's way of emphasizing the point in poetry, sermons, and prophecies.
  * When the parallelism is used in a story (a narrative text), either keep the parallelism or use your own culture's way of emphasizing the point in narrative.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.**  Psalms 119:105 \\ This can be written as: Your word is a lamp to my feet and your word is a light for my path. \\ Both 'lamp' and 'light' are parallel because they mean the same thing. The words 'my feet' and 'my path' also mean the same thing.
