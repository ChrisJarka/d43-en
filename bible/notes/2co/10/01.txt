====== 2 Corinthians 10:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Now I myself, Paul, appeal to you in a gentle and humble way, like Christ \add would. Certain people among you have falsely accused me by saying\add*, "When \add Paul\add* is with you, he is humble \add and speaks gently\add* to you, but when he is away from you, \add in the letters he writes to you\add* he threatens \add to punish\add* you." \add Those people claim that I do not have authority over you as an apostle\add*.
\v 2 I strongly plead with you, "\add Please do not listen to people who say things like that!\add*" \add I strongly plead with you to not listen to them\add*, so that when I am there \add with you\add* I will not \add need to\add* speak severely \add to you\add* in the same severe way as I \add plan to\add* speak to those people who think that I behave like people who are not believers.

\v 1 Now I, Paul, appeal to you with the meekness and gentleness that comes from Christ—I who was shy in front of you when standing before you, but bold toward you when I am far away from you—
\v 2 I plead with you that, when I come to you, I will not have to be show my boldness to some of you who need my boldness to prove that we are not living our lives in fulfillment of our sinful natures, you will see how bold I can be if I need to confront those who think this is true of us.

\v 1 I, Paul, myself appeal to you, by the humility and gentleness of Christ—I who am meek when in your presence, but bold toward you when away—
\v 2 I beg of you that when I am present, I would not need to be bold with the self-confidence that I consider to be daring, when I oppose those who think we are living according to the standards of this world.
