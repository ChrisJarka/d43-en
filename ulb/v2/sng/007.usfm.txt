\q
\v 1 How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince’s daughter!
\q Your rounded thighs are like jewels,
\q The work of the hands of a skillful workman.
\q
\v 2 Your body is like a round goblet,
\q Wherein no mingled wine is wanting:
\q Your waist is like a heap of wheat
\q Set about with lilies.
\q
\v 3 Your two breasts are like two fawns
\q That are twins of a roe.
\q
\v 4 Your neck is like the tower of ivory;
\q Your eyes as the pools in Heshbon,
\q By the gate of Bath-rabbim;
\q Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon
\q Which looks toward Damascus.
\q
\v 5 Your head upon you is like Carmel,
\q And the hair of your head like purple;
\q The king is held captive in the tresses thereof.
\q
\v 6 How fair and how pleasant are thou,
\q O love, for delights!
\q
\v 7 This your stature is like to a palm-tree,
\q And your breasts to its clusters.
\q
\v 8 I said, I will climb up into the palm-tree,
\q I will take hold of the branches thereof:
\q Let your breasts be as clusters of the vine,
\q And the smell of your breath like apples,
\q
\v 9 And your mouth like the best wine,
\q That goes down smoothly for my beloved,
\q Gliding through the lips of those that are asleep.
\b
\q
\v 10 I am my beloved’s;
\q And his desire is toward me.
\q
\v 11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field;
\q Let us lodge in the villages.
\q
\v 12 Let us get up early to the vineyards;
\q Let us see whether the vine has budded,
\q And its blossom is open,
\q And the pomegranates are in flower:
\q There will I give you my love.
\q
\v 13 The mandrakes give forth fragrance;
\q And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old,
\q Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
