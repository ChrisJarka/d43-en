\v 14 Then come to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but your disciples fast not?
\v 15 And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days
will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast.
