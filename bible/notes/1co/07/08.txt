====== 1 Corinthians 07:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Now I want to say this to you unmarried people and to you whose spouses have died: It would be good for you to remain \add unmarried\add* as I am.
\v 9 But if you cannot control your \add sexual desires\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*, you should get married. It is better to be married \add so that you can satisfy your sexual desires with your spouse\add* than to constantly have a strong desire \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add for sexual relations\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 To those who have never married and those whose husbands have died, I say, it would be a good thing for them if they continued as I am, living in singleness. There are many advantages for serving God when you are single.
\v 9 But some of you struggle with the many longings and desires people have, who want to marry. They are unfulfilled apart from marriage and they find singleness to be difficult. For those who are unable to find peace in singleness, they should marry. It is better for them to marry than for their desires and longings to destroy their witness for Christ.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 To the unmarried and to widows I say that it is good for them if they remain unmarried, as I am.
\v 9 But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better for them to marry than to burn with passion.
