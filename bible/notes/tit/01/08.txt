\v 8 Rather than that, he should be a friend to strangers, a friend of what is good, balanced in his thinking, honest, truthful and fair toward other people, someone who remembers God in all his thoughts and actions, and he should be self-controlled.
\v 9 He should hold on tightly to the reliable doctrine that he was taught so that he may use it to urge people toward good behavior and to correct undisciplined people.

\v 8 But he should be a friend to strangers, a friend of what is good, sensible, righteous, godly, and self-controlled.
\v 9 He should tightly hold to the trustworthy word of doctrine, so that he may be able to encourage by that doctrine what is sound and rebuke those who oppose him.
