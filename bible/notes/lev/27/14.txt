<usfm>
\v 14 \add Similarly\add*, if someone dedicates his house to be a sacred gift to belong to me, the priest will decide how much it is worth, which will depend on whether the house is in good condition. Whatever the priest says that it is worth, that will be its value \add and that is the price that the priest must pay for it\add*.
\v 15 If the man who dedicated his house to me later wants to buy it back, he must pay that price plus an added one-fifth, and then the house will belong to him again.

\v 14 Similarly, if someone dedicates his house, and to set it apart for the honor of Yahweh, the priest will decide how much it is worth, which will depend on the house's condition. Whatever the priest says that it is worth, that will be its value.
\v 15 If a man set apart his house for the honor of Yahweh, but later he wants to buy it back, he must pay that price plus an added one fifth, and then the house will belong to him again.

\v 14 When a man desires to dedicate his house to be set apart for Yahweh, then the priest will estimate its value. Whatever the priest values it at, that will be its value.
\v 15 But if the owner dedicates his home and later wishes to redeem it, then a fifth of its value is to be added to its redemption price, and then the house will be his again.
