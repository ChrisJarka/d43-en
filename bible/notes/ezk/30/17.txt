===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **vigorous** - "young and strong"
  * **Aven** - Aven was a city in Egypt. It was also call Heliopolis. It was a few miles north and east of where Cairo is today. (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]]) 
  * **Pi-Beseth** – Pi-Beseth was a city in Egypt. It was also call Bubastis.
  * **will fall by the sword** - Swords were one of the most important weapons in a battle or war, so "sword" is used to refer to "battle" or "war." Alternate translation: "will die in battle" or "will die in the war." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **they will walk in captivity** - "the people of these cities will become captives" or "the enemy will take the people of the people of these cities away as prisoners"
  * **Tehaphnehes** - Tehaphnehes was an important city in Egypt.
  * **in Tehaphnehes the day will hold back** - "the day will not come." This phrase compares the disaster that happens to Tehaphnehes with a day on which the sun does not rise. This shows that the disaster is very scary and bad. Alternate translation: "I will destroy Tehaphnehes in a scary and awful way." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **when I break the yoke of Egypt there** This expression means "When I destroy Tehphnhes, Egypt will no longer have control over other nations." (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])
  * **and the pride of her strength will be finished** – "Egypt will will not be proud of being strong anymore" or "that country will no longer be proud of being strong" (UDB)
  * **a cloud covering her** - "she will be sad" or "she will mourn". (See: Metaphor).
  * **her daughters will walk in captivity** - This is a reference to putting a city's daughters into salavery. And in biblical old testament times it was more offensive statement to say "We will put your daughters into slavery", then to state the same their men.
  * **execute judgments** - The word execute here means to complete a plan or task as planned. It does not mean "to put to death."
