\v 12 I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong,
\v 13 but you know that because of a weakness of the flesh I proclaimed the gospel to you the first time,
\v 14 and what was a trial to you in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but instead you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
