\v 12 I do not claim that I have already become completely like Christ Jesus; that is, I have not already become all that God intends me to be \f + \ft doublet \f*. But I earnestly try to become \add more and more like Christ\add*, because he chose me \add in order that I might become like him\add*.
\v 13 My fellow believers, I certainly do not consider that I have already become completely like Christ. But I \add am like a runner. A runner does not look backward\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Instead, he leans\f + \ft Or: stretches \f* forward as he runs straight toward the goal \add in order that he might win the race and get the prize. Similarly\add*, I do not think about what I have already done.
\v 14 Instead, I concentrate only on \add continuing to become more and more like Christ right up to the end of my life\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. As a result, because of my relationship with Christ Jesus, God will call\f + \ft Or: summon \f* me to receive a reward from him \add in heaven\add*.

\v 12 I do not claim that I have already become completely like Christ Jesus. But I do earnestly try to possess maturity as a  Christ-like believer, which is why Christ Jesus has taken possession of me, to become like him.
\v 13 My fellow believers, I certainly do not think that I have already become completely like Christ. But I am like a runner. A runner does not look backward as he runs straight toward the goal, so he might win the race and get the prize. Similarly, I do not think about what I have already done.
\v 14 Instead, I concentrate on continuing to become more and more like Christ right up to the end of my life when God will call  me to receive the reward from him in heaven.

\v 12 I have not yet received these things, and I am not already complete. But I continue pressing on that I may possess the maturity for which Christ Jesus possessed me.
\v 13 Brothers, I do not think I have possessed it myself.  But one thing I do is this: I forget what is behind and strive for what is ahead,
\v 14 I continue pressing on toward the goal to win the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
