\v 19 Then say to the people of the land, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They will
eat their bread with trembling and drink their water with shuddering;' since the land will be despoiled of its fullness because of the violence 
of all those who dwell there.
\v 20 So the cities that were inhabited will be desolate, and the land will become a wasteland; so you will know that I am Yahweh!"
