It is also necessary that I be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws \f + \ft Or:that the elders, the chief priests, and the men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws reject me \f*, and that I be killed \f + \ft Or:they kill me \f*. But on the third day \add after I am killed I\add* will become alive again."
