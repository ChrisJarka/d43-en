===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **And he answered and said to them**  - That is, "Jesus answered and said to the Pharisees, scribes, and elders."
  * **The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?"**  - This could also be translated as "Was John's authority to baptize people from heaven or from men?" or "Did God tell John to baptize people, or did people tell him to do it?"
  * **from heaven**  -  That is, “from God.” Jewish people avoided referring to God by his name “Yahweh.” Often they used the word “heaven” to refer to him (See: Metonymy).
