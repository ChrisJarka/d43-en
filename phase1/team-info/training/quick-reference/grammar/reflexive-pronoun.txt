====== Reflexive Pronoun ======

===== Description =====

Reflexive pronouns refer to someone who has already been referred to in a sentence. In English they are: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves,  yourselves, and themselves. 


===== Usage =====

A note is only necessary when __both the ULB and UDB are unclear about who the pronoun is referring to__.


===== Template =====

The following information should be included in the notes:

  - **Text** - the text that includes the reflexive pronoun from the ULB in bold
  - Clarifying translation - (optional)
  - **Explanation** - the reflexive pronoun and its purpose
  - Alternate translation - (optional)
  - **TA link** - unless already in the notes for the chunk

  * **(1) ULB text**  - **(3)** Explanation.  **(5)** (See: Reflexive Pronoun)


===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.

=== Acts 20:13 ===

"We ourselves went ahead of Paul by ship and sailed away to Assos, where we planned to take Paul on board."

  * **(1) We ourselves**  - **(3)**  The pronoun, 'ourselves', is used here to add emphasis and to separate Luke and his fellow travelling companions from Paul, who did not travel by boat. **(5)**  (See: Reflexive Pronoun)
