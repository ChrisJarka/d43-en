\v 23 So now you will become our slaves. You will always be forced to cut wood and carry water for \add us Israelite people who worship in\add* the temple of our God." That fulfilled \add what Noah\add* predicted \add when he said that the descendants of Canaan would be\add* cursed \add by being the slaves of the descendants of Shem\add*.

\v 22 And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Wherefore have you beguiled us, saying, We are very far from
you; when you dwell among us?
\v 23 Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers of water
for the house of my God.
