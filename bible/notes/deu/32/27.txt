===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: Parallelism)

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 20-29, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **Were it not that I fearead the provocation of the enemy - **  AT: "But I feared the provocation of the enemy " (See: Litotes)
  * **judge mistakenly**  - "misunderstand"
  * **And they would say - **  And the enemy would say
  * **Our hand is exalted**  - Here the enemies "hand" means their strenght or power. "Our strenght has triumphed" or "Our power has won" (See: Synecdoche)
  * **I would have done all this **- AT: "Yahweh has not done all this."
