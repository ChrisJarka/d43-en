===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the wrath of Yahweh had fallen on Judah and Jerusalem** - Here the words "Judah and Jerusalem" refer to the people who live there. Hezekiah speaks of Yahweh being angry with the people and punishing them as if his wrath were an object that fell upon them. AT: "because Yahweh was angry, he had punished the people of Judah and Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **an object of terror, of horror, and of scorn** - This can be translated with verbal phrases. AT: "something that terrifies and horrifies people, and something that people scorn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **as you can see with your own eyes** - The phrase "with your own eyes" emphasizes that the people can see this for themselves without others having to tell them about it. AT: "as you can see for yourselves"
  * **our fathers have fallen by the sword** - The idiom "fallen by the sword" means to die in battle. The word "sword" represents the soldiers, who used swords as their primary weapons. AT: "our fathers have died in battle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
