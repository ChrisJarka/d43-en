\c 13
\q
\v 1 A wise son hears his father’s instruction;
\q But a scoffer hears not rebuke.
\q
\v 2 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth;
\q But the soul of the treacherous shall eat violence.
\q
\v 3 He that guardeth his mouth keeps his life;
\q But he that opens wide his lips shall have destruction.
\q
\v 4 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and has nothing;
\q But the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.
\q
\v 5 A righteous man hates lying;
\q But a wicked man is loathsome, and comes to shame.
\q
\v 6 Righteousness guardeth him that is upright in the way;
\q But wickedness overthrows the sinner.
\q
\v 7 There is that makes himself rich, yet has nothing:
\q There is that makes himself poor, yet has great wealth.
\q
\v 8 The ransom of a man’s life is his riches;
\q But the poor hears no threatening.
\q
\v 9 The light of the righteous rejoiceth;
\q But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
\q
\v 10 By pride comes only contention;
\q But with the well-advised is wisdom.
\q
\v 11 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished;
\q But he that gathers by labor shall have increase.
\q
\v 12 Hope deferred makes the heart sick;
\q But when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.
\q
\v 13 Whoso despises the word brings destruction on himself;
\q But he that fears the commandment shall be rewarded.
\q
\v 14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life,
\q That one may depart from the snares of death.
\q
\v 15 Good understanding gives favor;
\q But the way of the transgressor is hard.
\q
\v 16 Every prudent man works with knowledge;
\q But a fool flaunteth his folly.
\q
\v 17 A wicked messenger falls into evil;
\q But a faithful ambassador is health.
\q
\v 18 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth correction;
\q But he that regards reproof shall be honored.
\q
\v 19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul;
\q But it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil.
\q
\v 20 Walk with wise men, and you shall be wise;
\q But the companion of fools shall hurt for it.
\q
\v 21 Evil pursueth sinners;
\q But the righteous shall be recompensed with good.
\q
\v 22 A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children;
\q And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous.
\q
\v 23 Much food is in the tillage of the poor;
\q But there is that is destroyed by reason of injustice.
\q
\v 24 He that spareth his rod hates his son;
\q But he that loves him chasteneth him betimes.
\q
\v 25 The righteous eats to the satisfying of his soul;
\q But the belly of the wicked shall want.
