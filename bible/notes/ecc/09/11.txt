====== Ecclesiastes 09:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 I have seen something else here on the earth:
\q1 The person who runs fastest does not always win the race,
\q1 the strongest soldiers do not always win the battle,
\q1 the wisest people do not always have food,
\q1 the smartest people do not always become rich,
\q1 and the people who have studied a lot are not always honored\f + \ft Or: treated very specially \f* by others;
\q1 we cannot always control what things will happen to us and where they will happen.
\p
\v 12 No one knows when he will die \f + \ft euphemism \f*;
\q1 fish are cruelly caught in a net,
\q2 and birds are caught in snares\f + \ft Or: traps \f*;
\q1 similarly \f + \ft simile \f*, people experience disasters
\q2 at times when they do not expect them to happen.

\v 11 I have seen some interesting things under the sun:
\q2 The race does not belong to swift people.
\q2 The battle does not belong to strong people.
\q2 Bread does not belong to wise people.
\q2 Riches do not belong to people of understanding.
\q2 Favor does not belong to people of knowledge.
\q1 Instead, time and chance affect them all.
\q1
\v 12 For no one knows his time to die,
\q2 just like fish trapped in a net of death,
\q2 or just like birds caught in a snare.
\q1 Like animals, human beings are imprisoned in evil times
\q2 that suddenly fall on them.
