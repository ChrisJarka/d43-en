\v 2-3 \add I say that\add* because those who speak messages that come directly from God \add are speaking in languages that they and the other believers in the congregation know, and thus\add* they are able to strengthen them \add spiritually\add* and to encourage and comfort them. But those who speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add* are not speaking to people. Instead, they are \add only\add* speaking to God. No one understands them. By \add the power\f + \ft Or: guidance \f* of God's\add* Spirit \f + \ft Or: From within \add their own\add* spirit \f* they speak things that others do not know.
\v 4 Those who speak in languages \add that they have not learned\add* are receiving a blessing for themselves, but those who speak messages that come directly from God are giving a blessing to \add all the believers in\add* the congregation \add because they are speaking in a language that the congregation knows\add*.

\p
\v 1 Pursue love and be zealous for spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.
\v 2 For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, for no man understands him because he speaks mysteries in the Spirit, 
\v 3 But the one who prophesies speaks to people, to build them up, to encourage them, and to comfort them. 
\v 4 He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.
