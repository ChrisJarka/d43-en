\v 8 And the master commended the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly, since the sons of this world are more shrewd concerning their own people than the sons of the light are.
\v 9 And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of worldly wealth, so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal dwellings.
