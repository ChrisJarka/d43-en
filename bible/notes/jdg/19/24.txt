\v 24 Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with them
what seems good to you: but to this man do not any such folly.
\v 25 But the men would not listen to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they
knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
\v 26 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the manâ€™s house where her lord was, till it
was light.
