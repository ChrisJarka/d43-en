\v 12 This will be the plague that Yahweh will use to strike all the peoples that have waged war against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot away even as they are standing up on their feet! Their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot within their mouth!
\v 13 So it will be in that day, a great tumult from Jehovah will come among them and each man will seize the hand of his neighbor and, each hand will be lifted up against the hand of his neighbor!
