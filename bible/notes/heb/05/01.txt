\v 1 For every high priest, chosen from among men, is appointed to act on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for their sins.
\v 2 He can deal gently with the ignorant and the wayweard since he himself also is burdened with weaknesses.
\v 3  Therefore, because of his weaknesses, he too is obligated to offer sacrifices for his sins just as he does for the people's sins.
