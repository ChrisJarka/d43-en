====== Sentences ======

==== Sentence Types ====

A **//sentence//** is a group of words that express a complete thought. They may:

   * State something (declarative) '//This is a fact.//'
  * Ask something (interrogative) '//Do you know him?//'
  * Exclaim something (exclamatory) '//Ouch, that hurt!//'
  * Order action (command) '//Pick that up.//'

The //**subject**// is who or what the sentence is about; Subjects are typically nouns or pronouns. Sometimes a subject is not stated but is implied. For example, 'Close the door.' The verb is 'close'; the subject is implied to be 'you.' See [[:en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]] for more information.

==== Sentence Structure ====

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>The simplest sentence structure in English includes a subject and a verb. Example:  // The boy ran.  //</font>

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Compound sentences are two complete sentences joined together with a comma and a conjunction (i.e. and, or, but). Example:  // The boy ran very hard, but he count not catch the fox.  //</font>

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Complex sentences, which many Bible verses are, contain various components such as as phrases, clauses and/or participles. Example:</font>    //Although the boy ran very hard, he couldn't catch the fox, which disappeared into the woods.//

Translators should use the sentence structure of the target language so that the final translation is natural. **Some aspects of this include word order and clause order.**

For example, in English, adjectives almost always come before the noun they describe, but in French, adjectives can occur before or after the noun, depending on their type.

  * English: t//he pretty flower//
  * French: //la jolie fleur//
  * English:// the purple flower//
  * French:// la fleur violette//

Sometimes languages put an object pronoun before the verb, whereas English puts it after the verb.

  * English: //The man sees the house.//
  * French: //L'homme voit la maison. //
  * English: //The man sees it. //
  * French: //L'homme la voit. //

Languages will also differ as to how they order their clauses. See also: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:wordorder|Word Order]].
