\v 46 And why call you me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
\v 47 Every one that comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:
\v 48 he is like a man building a house, who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock: and when a flood arose, the stream flowed against that house, and could not shake it: because it had been well built.
