===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The end of all things is coming** - AT: "Soon Jesus will return and bring all things on this earth to an end"
  * **be of sound mind, and be sober in your thinking** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Peter uses them to emphasize the need to think clearly about life since the end is near. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **your thinking** - The word "your" refers to all believers
  * **for love does not seek to discover the sins of others** - Peter describes "love" as if it were a person. AT: "for a person who loves others will not make an effort to find out if another person has sinned" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **hospitality** - to show kindness to guests and travelers
