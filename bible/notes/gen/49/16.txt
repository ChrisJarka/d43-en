<usfm>
\v 16 Dan, although your tribe will be small,
\q their leaders will rule their people just like the leaders of other tribes of Israel will rule their people.
\q
\v 17 Your descendants will be like snakes at the side of a road,
\q like poisonous snakes lying beside a path.
\q They will strike the heels of horses that pass by,
\q causing the riders to fall backwards as the horses rear up on their hind legs."
\p
\v 18 Then Jacob prayed, "Yahweh, I am waiting for you to rescue me from my enemies."
