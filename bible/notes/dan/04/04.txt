\v 4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.
\v 5 I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
\v 6 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the
interpretation of the dream.
