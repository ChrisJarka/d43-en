\c 10
\b
\q
\v 1 Why stand you afar off, O Jehovah?
\q Why hide you yourself in times of trouble?
\q
\v 2 In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued;
\q Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.
\q
\v 3 For the wicked boasts of his heartâ€™s desire,
\q And the covetous renounceth, yea, contemns Jehovah.
\q
\v 4 The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, saith, He will not require
it.
\q All his thoughts are, There is no God.
\q
\v 5 His ways are firm at all times;
\q Your judgments are far above out of his sight:
\q As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.
\q
\v 6 He says in his heart, I shall not be moved;
\q To all generations I shall not be in adversity.
\q
\v 7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression:
\q Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
\q
\v 8 He sits in the lurking-places of the villages;
\q In the secret places does he murder the innocent;
\q His eyes are privily set against the helpless.
\q
\v 9 He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert;
\q He lies in wait to catch the poor:
\q He does catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net.
\q
\v 10 He croucheth, he bows down,
\q And the helpless fall by his strong ones.
\q
\v 11 He says in his heart: God has forgotten;
\q He hides his face, he will never see it.
\q
\v 12 Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up your hand:
\q Forget not the poor.
\q
\v 13 Wherefore does the wicked contemn God,
\q And say in his heart, You will not require it?
\q
\v 14 You have seen it; for you behold mischief and spite, to requite it with your hand:
\q The helpless committeth himself to thee;
\q You have been the helper of the fatherless.
\q
\v 15 Break you the arm of the wicked;
\q And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till you find none.
\q
\v 16 Jehovah is King for ever and ever:
\q The nations are perished out of his land.
\q
\v 17 Jehovah, you have heard the desire of the meek:
\q You will prepare their heart, you will cause your ear to hear;
\q
\v 18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed,
\q That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more.
