===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Habakkuk continues to describe his vision of Yahweh.

  * **The sun and moon stood still** - The sun and moon not moving in the sky is spoken of as if they were people who stop walking and stand still. AT: "The sun and moon stop moving" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **above in their high places** - "in the sky"
  * **at the light of your arrows ... at the brightness of the lightning flash of your spear** - These two phrases share similar meanings and tell why the sun and moon have stood still. The lightning flashes in the sky are spoken of as if they were arrows that Yahweh shoots from his bow or a shining spear that he throws through the sky. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **indignation** - "great anger" or "fury"
  * **you have threshed the nations** - Yahweh punishing the people of the nations is spoken of as if he threshed the nations. Threshing refers to the practice of having an ox or some other animal trample upon grain stalks in order to crush them and remove the grain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
