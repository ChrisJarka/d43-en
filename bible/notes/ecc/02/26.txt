====== Ecclesiastes 02:26 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 God enables those who please him to be wise, to know many things, and to enjoy many things. But if sinful people work hard and become rich, God can take their money away from them and give it to those who please him. But that also is something that is difficult for me to understand. Their working hard seems useless, like chasing the wind.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 26 For to the man that pleases him, God gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleases God. This also is vapor and a striving after wind.
