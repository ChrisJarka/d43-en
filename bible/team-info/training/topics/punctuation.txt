====== Punctuation ======

We have decided to use "American-style" punctuation. For this project, that means:

  * Final punctuation should be included inside the quotation marks. (Ex. He said, "What are you doing?")
  * Do not use a comma before the "and" in a string of items. (Ex. the length, height and depth of the box.)
