===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Yet the people will not turn to him who struck them, nor will they seek Yahweh of Hosts** - Isaiah and other prophets claimed that the Lord punished his people so that they would return to him and worship him.   Alternate translation: "The people of Israel will not seek the Lord or return to him even after he has punished them." (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:discourse:implicitexplicit]])  
  * **Yahweh of Hosts** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
  * **Therefore Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed, in one day. The leader and the noble man are the head; and the prophet that teaches lies is the tail** - Isaiah describes Israel's leaders as the head of an animal, perhaps a snake, and as a palm branch, a symbol of kingly rule.  He describes prophets who tell lies as an animal's tail which moves around wildly and as a reed which blows in the wind, making meaningless sounds.  Alternate translation: "As a hunter cuts off a snake's head and tail and as a ruler clears his land of palm branches and reeds, so the Lord will quickly remove Israel's leaders and false prophets." (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:simile]])
