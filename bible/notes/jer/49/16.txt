===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking about what will happen to Edom.

  * **As for your fearsomeness** - Here the abstract noun "fearsomeness" can be replaced with a verb. AT: "As for how terrifying you think you are" or "Although you think you scare other people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **your heart's pride has deceived you** - Here "heart" represents the whole person. People deceiving themselves is spoken of as if their pride deceived them. AT: "you have become prideful, but you have deceived yourselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **so that you may make your nest high like an eagle** - It is implied that the people made homes in high places to remain safe from enemies. AT: "live in safety like an eagle in the heights of the mountains" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **eagle** - This is a very large, powerful bird of prey. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:04:13|4:13]].
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
