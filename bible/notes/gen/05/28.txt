  * **Noah**  - Translators may want to add a footnote that says "This name sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'relief' or 'comfort.'" But the name Noah does not mean "comfort".
  * **in our work and in the toil of our hands** - This is a doublet. It says the same thing twice to emphasize how hard the work was. This could be translated "from our work and from the toil of our hands"  or "from working hard with our hands." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:doublet]].)
