\v 34 And Jotham did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh. He did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
\v 35 However, the shrines were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense at the shrines. Jothan built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh.
\v 36 Now the rest of the deeds of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
