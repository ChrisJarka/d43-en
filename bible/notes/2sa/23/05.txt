===== Translation Notes: =====
This continues David's last words.

  * **Indeed, is my family not like this before God?** - "My family is indeed like this before God!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Has he not made...?** - "He has indeed made...!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Ordered and sure** - This means God's covenant will not change and David's family can trust it.
  * **Does he not increase my salvation...?** - "Does he not keep me safe...?" AT: "He does indeed increase my salvation...!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
