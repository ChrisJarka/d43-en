\v 1 On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.
\v 2 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, of those that kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.
\v 3 And the king said, What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered to him, There is nothing done for him.
