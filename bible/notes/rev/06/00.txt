=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Seven Seals ==
There is disagreement over how these seals are attached to the scroll. It would be logical if they were all side-by-side but the scroll would only have revealed its contents after the last seal is broken. This is not how this chapter describes the scroll because each seal reveals a [[:en:obe:kt:judge|judgment]]. It is also commonly held that the absent seventh seal reveals the seven bowl judgments.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== The Lamb ==
This is a reference to Jesus. In this chapter, it also functions as a title for Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).

== Metaphors ==
This chapter contains many different [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphors]] and symbols. The translators should avoid translating their meaning. If possible, allow any symbolic meaning to be determined later by the reader. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===
