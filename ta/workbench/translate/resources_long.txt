===== Multiple Notes on Long Phrase =====

Sometimes there are notes for a phrase and separate notes for portions of that phrase. In that case, the larger phrase is first, and its parts afterward. As in:

  * **you say, 'Behold, he is a gluttonous man**  - This can be translated as an indirect quote: "you say that he is a gluttonous man" or "you accuse him of being a gluttonous man."
  * **he is a gluttonous man**  - "he is a greedy eater" or "he habitually eats too much food"
