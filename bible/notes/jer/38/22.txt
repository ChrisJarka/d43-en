\v 22 behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes,
and those women shall say, Your familiar friends have set you on, and have prevailed over you:
now that your feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back.
\v 23 And they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans; and you shall not escape out of their hand,
but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.
