**CURRENCY USE IN OLD TESTAMENT TIMES** \\

• In Genesis 24:22 Abraham’s servant gave a gold nose ring weighing a beka (1/2 shekel) and two gold bracelets weighing 10 shekels (4 oz / 10 grams)\\ 
• The shekel is to consist of twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels equal one mina. (Ezekiel 45:12)\\

• When the Greeks dominated Israel then the economy used the Greek coins of gold, silver and copper. These had inscriptions of Caesars on the coins.\\ 
• History says in the year 140 B.C. the Maccabees received permission to coin Jewish money so they used an image of almond rod and pot of money.\\

**MONEY USE IN NEW TESTAMENT TIMES** 


**TALENT** \\ 
• Matthew 18:24 A man owed 10,000 Talents (NIV) ie millions\\ 
• Matthew 25:14-30 The parable of a a man gave 5, 2 and 1 Talents to his servants for investing.\\ 
• A talent (varies from place and time) but is estimated to be about 6,000 denarii (one denarius is one day’s wages). Thus in the parable Mathew 25:15 Five talents was the equivalent of 50,000 days or 137 years of work of one person.


\\ 
**MINA / POUNDS** \\ 
• 1 Mina = about 100 days of labor\\ 
• Luke 19:13-26 Parable of money given to slaves who then after the master came back was given charge over cities.


**STATER** \\ 
• Stater was made of silver\\ 
• 1 Stater = 8 Denarii or 4 Didrachom\\ 
• It's possible that the 30 pieces of silver that Judas Iscariot received from the priest could have been Staters (Matthew 36:15, Matthew 27:3-6)


**DIDRACHOM ** \\ 
• 1 Didrachom = 2 drachmas\\ 
• Matthew 17:24 After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax came to Peter and asked, “Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?” (NIV)\\ 
• Matthew 17:27 Jesus told Peter to go fishing and catch a fish. The fish will have a four-drachma coin in its mouth. That was to be used to pay a tax.


**DRACHMA Greek coin for a day’s wages** \\ 
• Luke 15:8-10 parable of 10 pieces of silver (drachmas)


**DENARIUS Roman coin for a day’s wages** \\ 
• Matthew 20:1-16 Parable in which each person was paid 1 denarius for a day of working in the field.\\ 
• Luke 10:35 the Good Samaritan paid two denarii (plural of denarius) for the care of the sick man.\\

• Mark 14:5 & John 12:5 the woman used ointment equal to 300 denarii a years worth of labor\\ 
• Luke 7:41 the debt owed was 500 and 50 denarii which was forgiven by the steward.

• Assarion was translated as a farthing in KJV\\ 
• Matthew 10:29 an Assarion/farthing could buy two sparrows\\ 
• Luke 12:6 price of five sparrows


**KODRANTES /QUADRANS** \\ 
• Kodrantes Greek word for the Latin Quadrans was worth 1/4 of a Assarion.\\ 
• Matthew 5:25 One will not come out of debtor's prison till you has paid the last kodrantes.\\ 
• Two mites (lepta) which make a kodrantes (KJV farthing)


**LEPTON / LEPTA** \\ 
• Mark 12:42, Luke 21:2Jesus saw a woman give two mites (one mite was a Greek lepton coin) and was the smallest and lightest coin in the economy.


**MONEY CHANGERS IN THE TEMPLE** \\ 
• Every year every male Israelite twenty and older had to pay into the temple treasury a half-shekel as an offering to the LORD (Exodus 30:13-15). Thus money changers were needed to provide the exchange into exactly a Jewish half shekel. The interest charged for this service of exchange was between 10 to 12% thus the money changers made a good profit. It was these money changers that Jesus drove out of the temple


**USERY / INTEREST TAX** \\ 
• Usury is mentioned in the parable Jesus told in Mathew 25:27. Although usury (charging interest on a loan or a deposit, was technically against Jewish law (Ex 22:25; Lev 25:36-37; Deut 23:19-20; Nehemiah 5:7; Psalm 15:5; Proverbs 28:8; Ezekiel 18:8, 13, 17; 22:12) it was the common practice in Jesus’ time. Jews could charge Gentiles usury just not each other.
