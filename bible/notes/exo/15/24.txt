\v 24 The people complained to Moses, saying, "What are we going to drink?"
\v 25 So Moses prayed to Yahweh. Then Yahweh showed him a tree. So he took one of the branches and threw it into the water, and the water became good to drink. There at Marah, Yahweh gave them a fixed rule to live by. He also tested them there, to determine if they would obey him.
\v 26 He said, "I am Yahweh, your God. If you will obey me when I speak to you and do those things that are right to me, and listen to all the things that I tell you, I will keep you from all the diseases that I brought on the Egyptians. Do not forget that I am Yaweh, the one who heals you."

\v 24 So the people complained against Moses, saying, "What can we drink?"
\v 25 He cried to Yahweh, and Yahweh showed him a tree. He threw it into the water, and the water was made drinkable.
There Yahweh made for them a binding ordinance, and there he tested them;
\v 26 He said, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, do what is right in his
eyes, pay attention to his commandments, and obey all his ordinances, I will put on you none of the diseases that I 
put upon the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh, who heals you."
