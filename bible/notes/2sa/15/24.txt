\v 24 Abiathar and Zadok, \add the priests\add*, were walking with them. The descendants of Levi \add who helped the priests\add* also went with them, carrying the sacred chest that contained the Ten Commandments. But they set it on the ground until all the others had left the city.
\p
\v 25 But then the king said to Zadok, "You two take the sacred chest back into the city. If Yahweh is pleased with me, he will some day allow me to return to see it and the place where it is kept.
\v 26 But if he says that he is not pleased with me, then I am willing for him to do to me whatever he thinks is good."

\v 24 And, lo, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set
down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
\v 25 And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, he
will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:
\v 26 but if he say thus, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seems good to him.
