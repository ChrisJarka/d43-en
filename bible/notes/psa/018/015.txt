The Psalmist continues to talk of Yaweh's great power.

  * **water channels appeared**  - AT: "earth path under the waters was clear" or "shape of earth under the ocean could be seen"
  * **blast of the breath of your nostrils **- AT: "air forced out with strength through the nose".  God does not have human physical characteristics. (See: Personifcation)
