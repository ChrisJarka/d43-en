\c 7
\d Shiggaion of David, which he sang to Jehovah, concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite.
\b
\q
\v 1 O Jehovah my God, in you do I take refuge:
\q Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me,
\q
\v 2 Lest they tear my soul like a lion,
\q Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
\q
\v 3 O Jehovah my God, if I have done this;
\q If there be iniquity in my hands;
\q
\v 4 If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me
\q (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary;)
\q
\v 5 Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it;
\q Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth,
\q And lay my glory in the dust. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 Arise, O Jehovah, in your anger;
\q Lift up yourself against the rage of mine adversaries,
\q And awake for me; you have commanded judgment.
\q
\v 7 And let the congregation of the peoples compass you about;
\q And over them return you on high.
\q
\v 8 Jehovah ministereth judgment to the peoples:
\q Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that is in me.
\q
\v 9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish you the righteous:
\q For the righteous God tries the minds and hearts.
\q
\v 10 My shield is with God,
\q Who saves the upright in heart.
\q
\v 11 God is a righteous judge,
\q Yea, a God that has indignation every day.
\q
\v 12 If a man turn not, he will whet his sword;
\q He has bent his bow, and made it ready;
\q
\v 13 He has also prepared for him the instruments of death;
\q He makes his arrows fiery shafts.
\q
\v 14 Behold, he suffers with iniquity;
\q Yea, he has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
\q
\v 15 He has made a pit, and digged it,
\q And is fallen into the ditch which he made.
\q
\v 16 His mischief shall return upon his own head,
\q And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.
\q
\v 17 I will give thanks to Jehovah according to his righteousness,
\q And will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.
