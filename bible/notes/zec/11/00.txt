====== Zechariah 11 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter unlike the previous one is a warning against the leaders amongst the exiles.

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 11:1-3,17, which are extended quotations.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

This chapter uses an extended metaphor of sheep and shepherds to convey Yahweh's dismay at the leaders of the exiles. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

The writer uses symbolism. The Zechariah is told to become a shepherd and he uses two staffs and names them Unity and Favor. He does very specific things with them. In order to preserve this symbolism it is important to pay attention the specific words used.
