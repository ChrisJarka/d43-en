\v 39 But the Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of a cup and a bowl, but the inside of you is filled with greed and evil.
\v 40 You thoughtless men, did not the maker make the outside and the inside?
\v 41 What should be inside you is to give to the poor and to recognize that all things are clean for you.
