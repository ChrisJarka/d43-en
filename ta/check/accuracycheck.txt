===== How To Do an Accuracy Check =====

The people who do the Level One accuracy check can be members of the translation team, but they should __not__ be the same people who translated the story or Bible passage that they are checking. They can also be members of the community who are not part of the translation team. They should be speakers of the language of the translation, be respected in the community, and, if possible, know the Bible well in the language of wider communication. The purpose of this step is to make sure that the translation accurately communicates the meaning of the original story or Bible passage. The checkers will be helping the translation team think about the best way to translate the meaning of the story or Bible passage in their own language. There can be one person who checks a story or Bible passage, or more than one. Having more than one person checking a story or passage can be helpful, because often different checkers will notice different things. The people doing the checking should follow these steps: 

- Each of the checkers should read the translation (or listen to the recording) by himself, comparing it to the original Bible passage or story in the language of wider communication. As the checker reads (or listens to) the translation and compares it to the original, he should keep in mind these general questions: 

* Does the translation add anything to the original meaning? 
* Is there any part of the meaning that is left out of the translation? 
* Has the translation changed the meaning in any way? 

In addition to these general questions, the checker should consider the questions for specific Bible passages that are being developed. [link] 

2. The checker should make notes where he thinks there might be a problem or something to be improved. 

3. After the checkers have done this individually, they should all meet with the translator or translation team and review the story or Bible passage together. As they come to the places where each checker made note of a problem or question, the checkers can ask their questions or make suggestions for improvement. As the checkers and the translation team discuss the questions and suggestions, they might think of other questions or new ways of saying things. This is good. As the checkers and the translation team work together, God will help them discover the best way to communicate the meaning of the stories. 

4. After the checkers and the translation team have decided what they need to change, the translation team will revise the translation. 

5. After the translation team revises the translation, they should read it out loud to each other or to other members of the language community to make sure that it still sounds natural in their language. 

6. The translator (or team) makes a note of any Bible passages that are still difficult to understand, and where they would like additional consultant help. These notes will be used by the church leaders and checkers in levels two and three, so that they can help the translators understand the meaning and communicate it more clearly.
