====== 1 John 02 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== New and old commandments ==
The old commandments are contained in the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Moses]]. The new commandments are those given to the church after the death and resurrection of Jesus. 

== Antichrist ==
This chapter refers to both a specific Antichrist and many different antichrists. "Antichrist" means to be against Jesus. The antiChrist is a person who will come in the [[:en:obe:kt:lastday|last days]] and imitate the ministry of Jesus for [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]]. Before this person comes, there will be many different people who work against the cause of Christ and are referred to as "antichrists" because they are working against Jesus. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metonymy ==
There are many different [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|metonymies]] used in this chapter. They are used to teach and to give instructions that are generic and can be applied in many different circumstances. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "This we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments" ==
John has just stated that all Christians sin, so how can this statement be accurate if Christian do not always keep God's commandments? What John is explaining is that the desire to serve God is born from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and the new life or nature given to Christians. It is not that a person who sins is not a Christian. The word "know" can be understood in many different ways and this range of meaning can cause confusion here.
