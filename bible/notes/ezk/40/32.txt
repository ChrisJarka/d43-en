\v 32 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures;
\v 33 and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were
windows therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\v 34 And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that
side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.
