===== Definition: =====

Text

  * They appear to be fiery spiritual beings per Isaiah 6, Ezekiel 1 and Ezekiel 10.  There is a related Hebrew word which means "flames." They have a special closeness to God because they appear in His immediate manifest presence as in the throne room of Isaiah 6 and the the LORD is manifested immediately above them in Ezekiel 1.  There are also wooden representations of them on top of the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy Place, again signifying that these are beings with an especially close relationship with God.
