\v 1 Moreover Elihu answered and said,
\q
\v 2 Hear my words, you wise men;
\q And give ear to me, you that have knowledge.
\q
\v 3 For the ear tries words,
\q As the palate tastes food.
\q
\v 4 Let us choose for us that which is right:
\q Let us know among ourselves what is good.
\q
\v 5 For Job has said, I am righteous,
\q And God has taken away my right:
\q
\v 6 Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar;
\q My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.
\q
\v 7 What man is like Job,
\q Who drinks up scoffing like water,
\q
\v 8 Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,
\q And walks with wicked men?
\q
\v 9 For he has said, It profiteth a man nothing
\q That he should delight himself with God.
\b
\q
\v 10 Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:
\q Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,
\q And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
\q
\v 11 For the work of a man will he render to him,
\q And cause every man to find according to his ways.
\q
\v 12 Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly,
\q Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
\q
\v 13 Who gave him a charge over the earth?
\q Or who has disposed the whole world?
\q
\v 14 If he set his heart upon himself,
\q If he gather to himself his spirit and his breath;
\q
\v 15 All flesh shall perish together,
\q And man shall turn again to dust.
\b
\q
\v 16 If now you have understanding, hear this:
\q Listen to the voice of my words.
\q
\v 17 Shall even one that hates justice govern?
\q And will you condemn him that is righteous and mighty?â€”
\q
\v 18 Him that says to a king, You are vile,
\q Or to nobles, You are wicked;
\q
\v 19 That respecteth not the persons of princes,
\q Nor regards the rich more than the poor;
\q For they all are the work of his hands.
\q
\v 20 In a moment they die, even at midnight;
\q The people are shaken and pass away,
\q And the mighty are taken away without hand.
\b
\q
\v 21 For his eyes are upon the ways of a man,
\q And he sees all his goings.
\b
\q
\v 22 There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,
\q Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
\q
\v 23 For he needs not further to consider a man,
\q That he should go before God in judgment.
\q
\v 24 He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out,
\q And sets others in their stead.
\q
\v 25 Therefore he takes knowledge of their works;
\q And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
\q
\v 26 He striketh them as wicked men
\q In the open sight of others;
\q
\v 27 Because they turned aside from following him,
\q And would not have regard in any of his ways:
\q
\v 28 So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him,
\q And he heard the cry of the afflicted.
\q
\v 29 When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?
\q And when he hides his face, who then can behold him?
\q Alike whether it be done to a nation, or to a man:
\q
\v 30 That the godless man reign not,
\q That there be none to ensnare the people.
\b
\q
\v 31 For has any said to God,
\q I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any
more:
\q
\v 32 That which I see not teach you me:
\q If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?
\q
\v 33 Shall his recompense be as you wilt, that you refusest it?
\q For you must choose, and not I:
\q Therefore speak what you knowest.
\q
\v 34 Men of understanding will say to me,
\q Yea, every wise man that hears me:
\q
\v 35 Job speaks without knowledge,
\q And his words are without wisdom.
\q
\v 36 Would that Job were tried to the end,
\q Because of his answering like wicked men.
\q
\v 37 For he adds rebellion to his sin;
\q He clappeth his hands among us,
\q And multiplies his words against God.
