\q
\v 1 My son, if you will receive my words,
\q And lay up my commandments with thee;
\q
\v 2 So as to incline your ear to wisdom,
\q And apply your heart to understanding;
\q
\v 3 Yea, if you cry after discernment,
\q And lift up your voice for understanding;
\q
\v 4 If you seek her as silver,
\q And search for her as for hid treasures:
\q
\v 5 Then shall you understand the fear of Jehovah,
\q And find the knowledge of God.
\q
\v 6 For Jehovah gives wisdom;
\q Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding:
\q
\v 7 He lays up sound wisdom for the upright;
\q He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;
\q
\v 8 That he may guard the paths of justice,
\q And preserve the way of his saints.
\q
\v 9 Then shall you understand righteousness and justice,
\q And equity, yea, every good path.
\q
\v 10 For wisdom shall enter into your heart,
\q And knowledge shall be pleasant to your soul;
\q
\v 11 Discretion shall watch over thee;
\q Understanding shall keep thee:
\q
\v 12 To deliver you from the way of evil,
\q From the men that speak perverse things;
\q
\v 13 Who forsake the paths of uprightness,
\q To walk in the ways of darkness;
\q
\v 14 Who rejoice to do evil,
\q And delight in the perverseness of evil;
\q
\v 15 Who are crooked in their ways,
\q And wayward in their paths:
\q
\v 16 To deliver you from the strange woman,
\q Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words;
\q
\v 17 That forsakes the friend of her youth,
\q And forgetteth the covenant of her God:
\q
\v 18 For her house inclines to death,
\q And her paths to the dead;
\q
\v 19 None that go to her return again,
\q Neither do they attain to the paths of life:
\q
\v 20 That you may walk in the way of good men,
\q And keep the paths of the righteous.
\q
\v 21 For the upright shall dwell in the land,
\q And the perfect shall remain in it.
\q
\v 22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the land,
\q And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.
