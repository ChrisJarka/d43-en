===== Publishing to unfoldingWord =====

There is a process to follow to get translated work published:
  - Translators translate the OBS or Bible text from a Source Language.
  - The translation is checked by the community or a church representative.
  - Fill out the short form found on [[https://admin.unfoldingword.org/publish/request/]] 
  - The translated text version and checking level is posted on the Door43 website.
    *  See the left side panel of the text in the target language.
