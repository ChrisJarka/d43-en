===== Common Issues that Require Review =====

These are issues that often occur:

  * A note might be commentary or interpretation rather than a translation issue.
  * A note might have complicated language that would be hard for some of our audience.
  * A note might not be worded, structured, and formatted according to [[:en:bible:team-info:processes:create-notes|How to Create Translation Notes]]
  * A note might be a repeat of a note in another chunk, and could be solved by saying "See how you translated this in 8:19" and adding a link to that chunk.
  * There may be issues that are not addressed by translation notes.
  * Figures of speech may be identified, but their purpose in the text may not be explained.
  * The notes team may have disagreed about how to handle something.
  * Changes to the UDB or ULB may be needed.
  * Notes may need to be changed to fit with revisions to the UDB or ULB.
  * Important Terms may be missing or incorrectly linked.
