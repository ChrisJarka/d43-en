===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Babylon was a golden cup in the hand of Yahweh that made all the world drunk** - The word "world" is a metonym for the people living in the nations surrounding Babylon. Making those people drunk could be a metaphor for Yahweh punishing those nations by allowing Babylon to conquer them. AT: "Babylon was a strong nation that Yahweh used to punish all the people of the surrounding nations severely" Or it could be a metaphor for those nations joining Babylon in worshiping idols and being violent. AT: "Babylon was a rich and powerful nation, and other nations wanted to become sinful just like it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **nations drank her wine and became insane** - Possible meanings are 1) "Babylon defeated and destroyed other nations" or 2) "nations enjoyed her riches and power and became evil." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **insane** - "unable to think clearly"
  * **Babylon will ... be destroyed** This can be translated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will destroy Babylon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Wail** - make a long, loud cry that shows that the person is sad
  * **perhaps she can be healed** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "perhaps Yahweh can heal her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
