\v 21 The earth trembleth at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea.
\v 22 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
