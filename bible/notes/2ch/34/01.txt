  * **the eighth year ... the twelfth year** - "the 8th year ... the 12th year" or "year 8 ... year 12" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:14:01|14:2]]
  * **what was right in the eyes of Yahweh** - Here Yahweh's "sight" refers to how he judges or decides on the value of something. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:14:01|14:2]]. AT: "the things that Yahweh said were right" or "the things that Yahweh considers right" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **walked in all the ways of David his ancestor** - Josiah behaving as David did is spoken of as if he walked on the same road or way as David. AT: "lived the way David his ancestor had lived" or "followed the example of David his ancestor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from ... the cast metal figures** - This speaks of Josiah getting rid of the things that were used for worshiping false gods from Judah and Jerusalem as if he were making the places physically clean. Josiah would have commanded his workers to remove these things. AT: "he began to make Judah and Jerusalem acceptable again to Yahweh by having his workers remove from them the high places, the Asherah poles, the craved figures, and the cast metal figures" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
