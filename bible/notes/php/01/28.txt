<usfm>
\v 28 And do not be frightened by anything from those opposing you, which is for them a sign of their destruction but of your salvation, which comes from God.
\v 29 Because to you it has been granted on the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf,
\v 30 causing you to have the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
