\v 45 If you are wanting to use one of your feet to sin, do not use it! Even if you have to cut off your foot to avoid sinning, do it! It is good that you live eternally, even though you lack one of your feet while you are here on earth. But it is not good that you sin and as a result for God to throw your whole body into hell.

===== Translation Notes: =====

While talking to his disciples, Jesus has just given two other illustrations about how important it is not to cause simple people or children not to believe.

  * **better for you to enter into life lame** - Whatever the personal cost, separate from sin and embrace obedient faith. This is the third similar illustration Jesus uses to make his point strongly. (See: Parallelism and Hyperbole)
  * **maimed** - "crippled"
  * **unquenchable fire** - "fire that never goes out" or "fire that cannot stop burning"
