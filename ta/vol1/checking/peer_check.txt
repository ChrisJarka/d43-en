How to do a Peer Check of Your Draft Translation
* Give your translation to a member of the translation team who did not work on this passage. Have that person go through all of the same steps of the Self Check, making note of any places that need fixing.
* Review the translation together and fix those places.
* Read the revised translation out loud to this person and fix anything that does not sound like it is the way that someone from your community would say it.
