\v 21 He told them another parable, saying, "People certainly do not light an oil lamp and then bring it in the house in order that it may be put under something that would cover its light.  Instead, they put it on a lamp stand so that the light will shine.
\v 22 Similarly, things that were hidden will be brought made known, and the things that have been done in secret will be brought into the light.
\v 23 If you want to understand this, you should consider carefully what you have just heard."

\v 21 He said to them, "Is the lamp brought inside to be put under a bushel, or under the bed, and not to be put on a lampstand?
\v 22 For there is nothing hidden that will not be made known, nor is there anything done in secret that will not come to light
\v 23 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
