**What is the Book of Joshua about?**\\
The Book of Joshua is about how God fulfilled his promise that the Israelites would enter the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]] and occupy it. This was done as they united in obedience to God and as they fought battles under his direction through Joshua, the leader who took the place of Moses. This book also tells how the twelve tribes received their various portions of the land when it was shared out it them.

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]). The name “Joshua” means “Yahweh saves.” It is the same name as "Jesus." It is not only a book written by Joshua, but a book about Israel under the leadership of Joshua as well.

**Who wrote the Book of Joshua?**\\
There is no indication in the book about who wrote it, although there are several references in it to Joshua writing some things down. It became traditional in Judaism, however, to think that Joshua wrote most of the book.



===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
**Was the conquest of Canaan a religious war?**\\
Joshua gives the rules for a religious or holy war. During the conquest, some people were spared, but in many cases, the army was ordered to kill the people, their livestock, to "utterly destroy" everything in the city. At other times, the city would be plundered and the animals would be taken, but the people would be killed. This unique situation was morally acceptable because God as the king of Israel ordained these actions as punishment for the evil of the Canaanite people.

These battles were carried out as acts of loyalty to God's covenant with Moses. It is the mighty acts of God in repeatedly conquering their enemies which is the center of this account. Even in their failures, Israel defined the ideal of what covenantal obedience should be.

**Who were the twelve tribes in Joshua?**\\
While the twelve tribes are the twelve sons of Jacob, these are not the twelve peoples who receive a portion of the Promised Land. This is because the priests, who are descendants of Jacob's son Levi, did not receive any land.  Instead, Jacob's son Joseph receive two portions of land. These portions were given to Joseph's sons Ephraim and Manasseh. This is why Joseph does not appear to receive an allotment of land.

**Why was it wrong for the people east of the Jordan River to build another altar?**\\
Religiously, it was very important that Israel have a central place of worship. This promoted the unity of Israel centered on the one altar. The unity of Israel plays an important part in the book of Joshua.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**What is the meaning of the phrase "to this day"?**\\
This phrase often occurs in the Book of Joshua. It marks passages that describe events that led to conditions still existing at the time that this book was either initially written or revised. The first such example concerns the twelve stones placed in the Jordan River to mark where the Israelites crossed it ([[en:bible:notes:jos:04:08]]): "And the memorial is there to this day."

This phrase suggests that there was a significant period of time between the events of the book and when they were written. The translator must avoid giving the impression that the present day of the translation's readers is meant.  

**What does the phrase "all Israel" mean?**\\
This phrase appears many times in the Book of Joshua, but it does not always mean the entire Israelite nation, that is, literally all Israelites. At times it means the Israelite army; at other times it means the representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel. In still other passages it probably means many people throughout the nation of Israel.

**When should Joshua be translated**\\
The Book of Joshua should probably not be translated before Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy are translated. This is because the overall historical context of Judges will not be understood without the context provided by these previous books.
