~~DISCUSSION~~{{tag>check book5}}

Perhaps the title "A Song of Ascents" should be addressed for the translator, since it is written in English Bible most translations.

"I call out to you to help me" does not say the same thing as "my  voice for pleas for mercy"  , The Psalm reads that the speaker is examining himself, repentant for his own failings, yet the UDB sounds more like the troubles come from outside himself.

"Hear me" has a command voice ,"let Your ear be attentive" has a more submissive asking tone.  I do not know how to rewrite to get this attitude into the text.
