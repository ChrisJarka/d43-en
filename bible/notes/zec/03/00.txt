====== Zechariah 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter is introduced in prose and then shares the fourth vision of the priest in filthy clothes. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

This chapter seems to refer to a particular person, Joshua the high priest. However, we do not know anything more about him.
