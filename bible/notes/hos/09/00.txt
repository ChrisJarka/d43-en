====== Hosea 09 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The chapter is written in poetic form showing Yahweh's displeasure with Israel's [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sins]]. He is showing the many ways in which they do not worship him. The priests and kings don't understand how they have totally broken their [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenant]] with their God. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Exile ==
Because the covenant has been broken, the people will be exiled into another land. This actually shows the mercy of God toward His people. He did not destroy them; He simply moved them to another place. 
However, this chapter goes into many parts of their society to show how far they have moved away from truly worshipping Yahweh. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Change in Speaker ==
In verse 16 Yahweh is speaking but in verse 17 Hosea starts speaking. There is a change in pronouns and and the use of "My God" must mean someone other than Yahweh is speaking.
