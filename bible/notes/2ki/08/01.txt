\v 1 Now Elisha had spoken to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your household, and
sojourn wherever you can sojourn: for Jehovah has called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
\v 2 And the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God; and she went with her household, and sojourned in
the land of the Philistines seven years.
