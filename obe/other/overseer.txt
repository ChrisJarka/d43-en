====== overseer ======

===== Definition: =====

The term “overseer” refers to a person who supervises or who is in charge of the work and welfare of other people.

  * In the Old Testament, an overseer had the job of making sure the workers under him did their work well. Another term for this might be "supervisor."
  * In the New Testament this term is used to describe leaders of the early Christian church. Their work was to oversee or tend to the spiritual needs of the believers, including making sure they received accurate Biblical teaching.
  * Paul refers to an overseer as being a shepherd over his “flock,” which refers to the believers in the local church.
  * The overseer, like a shepherd, keeps watch over the flock. He guards and protects the believers from false spiritual teaching and other evil influences.
  * Jesus is also described as the chief Overseer of the Church.
  * The Bible indicates that the terms “overseer,” “elder,” and “shepherd/pastor" were probably different ways of referring to the same spiritual leaders.
