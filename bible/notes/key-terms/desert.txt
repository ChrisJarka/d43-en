====== desert, wilderness ======

===== Definition: =====

A desert is a dry, barren place where very few plants and trees can grow. Because it is uninhabitable, a desert is also referred to as wilderness.

  * A desert usually has sandy and austere terrain with high winds.
  * Wilderness is derived from the word "wild" and conveys the meaning of being remote, desolate and uninhabitable.
