\v 7 Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon
had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the
poorest of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;
\v 8 then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, to wit, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of
Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they
and their men.
