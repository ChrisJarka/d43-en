<usfm>
\v 15 Suppose that a man has two wives, but he likes one of them and dislikes the other one. And suppose that they both give birth to sons, and the oldest son is the child of the woman that he does not like.
\v 16 On the day when that man decides how he will divide his possessions for his sons to possess \add after he dies\add*, he must not favor the son of the wife that he loves by giving him \add a bigger share\add*, the share that the older son should receive.
\v 17 He must give two-thirds of his possessions to the older son, the son of the wife whom he does not like. That son is his firstborn son, and he must be given the share that he should receive because of his being that man's firstborn son.

\v 15 If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated;
\v 16 then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn:
\v 17 but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.
