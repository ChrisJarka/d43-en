\v 11 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him.
\v 12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why does this generation seek a sign? verily I say to you, There shall
no sign be given to this generation.
\v 13 And he left them, and again entering into the boat departed to the other side.
