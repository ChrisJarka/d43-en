\v 16 For we did not follow cleverly invented myths when we told you about the power and the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
\v 17 For he received from God the Father honor and glory when a voice was borne to him from the Majestic Glory saying, "This is my Son, the beloved One, with whom I am well pleased." 
\v 18 We heard this voice that came out of heaven, while we were with him on the holy mountain.
