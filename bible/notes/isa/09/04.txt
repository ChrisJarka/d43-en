===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For the yoke of his burden, the beam across his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor is shattered** - These phrases suggest the Israelites' life of slavery and suffering under oppressors.  A "beam across his shoulder" is a yoke, and all three phrases express the same meaning. (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]]) (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]]) The word "his" refers to the Israelites.  To shatter is to "break into pieces."  Alternate translation: "The Lord has broken into pieces the yoke of your burden, the beam across your shoulders, and the rod of your oppressors."

  * **as on the day of Midian** - This is referring to a past battle when the army of the Midian people were destroyed.
  * **For every boot treading in the tumult and the garments rolled in blood** - "The boots that the enemy soldiers wore and their clothing which has stains of blood on them" (UDB)
  * **fuel for the fire** - The clothing of war is something to be burned up in a big fire.
