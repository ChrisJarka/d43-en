\v 3 However, I am sending Titus and the other two believers in order that \add they will be able to help you finish collecting the money. Then when I and others arrive later, the people with me will see for themselves that\add* the things that I have been boasting about you are true \f + \ft litotes \f*. \add I want\add* you \add to have your gift\add* ready \add for us\f + \ft exclusive \f* to take to Jerusalem\add*, just like I have been telling them that you were ready.
\v 4 When I come, if any of \add the believers from\add* Macedonia come with me, \add I do not want them to find that your gift is\add* \f + \ft metonymy, euphemism \f* not ready. If that were \add to happen\add*, I would be very ashamed, and you yourselves would be even more ashamed.
\v 5 So that is why I felt that it was necessary to urge these \add three\add* believers to go \add and visit\add* you before I \add come. In that way, they would be able to help you to finish\add* collecting the generous gift \f + \ft euphemism \f* that had been promised by you \f + \ft Or:you had said you would give \f*. \add If you do that, not only will\add* the gift be ready \add by the time that we arrive, but everyone will see that you have given because you really want to give, and\add* not because anyone has forced you to give.

\v 3 For I sent the brothers so when they met you, they would see that our praise for you was not for nothing, and so you would be ready to finish the work, as I promised.
\v 4 My concern is that some Macedonians might come and find that we are not ready to complete this collection and we would feel that we had disappointed them—I am not speaking of you is saying this—because we had been so confident that this would be completed.
\v 5 I decided it was necessary to make every effort to bring the brothers along so that we could make arrangements in advance to receive the money that you had promised for this ministry, and that the gift would be given by you freely and not because you were compelled by anyone to give it.

\v 3 But I sent the brothers so that our boasting about you may not be an pointless exercise and so that you would be ready, as I said you would be.
\v 4 Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we would be put to shame—I say nothing about you—for being so confident in you.
\v 5 So I thought it was necessary to urge the brothers to come to you and to make arrangements in advance for the gift you had promised, so that it might be ready as a freely-offered gift, and not because you were forced to give it.
