\v 18 Men who belong to the group of Sadducees deny what other Jews believed, that people become alive again after they die. Some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him,
\v 19 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us Jews that if a man who has no children dies, his brother should marry the dead man's widow. Then if those two bear children, everyone will consider that those children are the children of the man who died, and in that way the dead man will continue to have descendants.

\v 18 Then Sadducees came to him, they who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,
\v 19 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If a man's brother dies and leaves a wife behind him, but no child, the man should take the brother's wife, and have a child for his brother.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Before this while seeking to trap Jesus, the Pharisees and Herodians had asked him about paying taxes.

    * **Moses wrote for us, 'If a man's brother** - If you don't have the ability to put a quote within a quote, the Sacduccees quotation from Moses could be stated as an indirect quote rather than a direct quote  “Moses wrote that if a man's brother dies…” (See: Indirect quote)
    * **Moses wrote for us....**  - This quote comes from God's Old Testament laws in the first five books.
