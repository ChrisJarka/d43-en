====== Isaiah 25 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

This chapter shifts from being a prophecy against the nations to the personal praises of Isaiah. He praises Yahweh for the deliverance of his people. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:deliverer]] and [[:en:obe:kt:peopleofgod]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== End times ==
This chapter appears to prophesy about the messiah's kingdom. This would therefore primarily reference events during the "end times."
