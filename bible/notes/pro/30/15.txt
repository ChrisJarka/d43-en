\v 15 The leach has two daughters, "Give, give," they cry.
\q There are three things that are never satisfied,
\q four never say, "Enough":
\q
\v 16 Sheol; the barren womb;
\q land thirsty for water;
\q and the fire that never says, "Enough."
\q
\v 17 The eye that mock a father,
\q and scorns obedience to a mother,
\q will be picked out by the ravens of the valley,
\q and the young eagles shall eat it.
\b
