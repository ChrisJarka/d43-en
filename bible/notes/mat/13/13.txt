\v 13 That is why I use parables when I speak to people, because although they see \add what I do\add*, they do not perceive \add what it means\add*, and although they hear \add what I say\add*, they do not really understand \add what it means\add*.
\v 14 What these people do completely fulfills what \add God told\add* the prophet Isaiah \add to say long ago to the people who did not\add* try to understand what he said, \p You will hear \add what I say\add*, but you will not understand it. You will keep seeing \add what I do\add*, but you will not understand \add what it means\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*. \p

\v 13 That is why I use parables when I speak to people, because although they see what I do, they do not understand what it means, and although they hear what I say, they do not really learn what it means.
\v 14 What these people do completely fulfills what God told the prophet Isaiah to say long ago,
\q 
\p You will hear what I say, but you will not understand it.
\q  You will see what I do, but you will not learn what it means.

\v 13 So I talk to them in parables, because although they see, they do not really see. And although they hear, they do not really hear, neither do they understand.
\v 14 To them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, that which says, 
\q 'While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand;
\q while seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to explain to his disciples why he teaches in parables.
  * **General Information:** - In verse 14, Jesus quotes the prophet Isaiah to show that the people's failure to understand Jesus' teaching is a fulfillment of prophecy.

  * **I talk to them** - The pronoun "them" in these two verses refers to the people in the crowd.
  * **because although they see, they do not really see. And although they hear, they do not really hear** - Jesus uses this parallelism to tell the disciples that the crowd refuses to understand. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **although they see, they do not really see** - "though they see things, they do not understand them." The second use of "see" here means understand.
  * **although they hear, they do not really hear, neither do they understand** - What is heard can be stated clearly. AT: "though they hear instruction, they do not understand the truth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand; while seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive** - This begins a quote from the prophet Isaiah about the unbelieving people of Isaiah's day. Jesus is using this quote to describe the crowd that was listening to Him. This is another parallelism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand** - "You will hear things, but you will not understand them."  What is heard can be stated clearly. AT: "You will hear instruction, but you will not understand the truth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **while seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive** - "you will see things, but you will not understand them."
