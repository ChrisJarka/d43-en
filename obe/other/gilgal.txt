The term Gilgal was a town north of Jericho and was the first place that the Israelites camped after crossing the Jordan River to enter Canaan.

  * There may also have been several other places called "Gilgal."
  * The Gilgal near Jericho was the political, religous and military center of the tribe.
  * Gilgal was the departure point of Elijah and Elisha as they crossed the Jordon when Elijah was taken up to heaven.
  * The word "gilgal" means "circle of stones," perhaps referring to a place where a circular altar was built. It is also related to the word for something that rolls.
  * The word almost always occurs in the phrase, "the gilgal," which may indicate that this was a general reference to a kind of place rather than to a specific place name.
