\v 11 Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 12 Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: You sealest up
the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
\v 13 You was in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the
beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of your tabrets and of
your pipes was in thee; in the day that you was created they were prepared.
