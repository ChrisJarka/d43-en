\c 25
\p
\v 1 O Jehovah, you are my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise your name; for you have done wonderful things,
even counsels of old, in faithfulness and truth.
\v 2 For you have made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be
built.
\v 3 Therefore shall a strong people glorify thee; a city of terrible nations shall fear thee.
\v 4 For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade
from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.
\v 5 As the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of
the terrible ones shall be brought low.
\p
\v 6 And in this mountain will Jehovah of hosts make to all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of
fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
\v 7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over
all nations.
\v 8 He has swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his
people will he take away from off all the earth: for Jehovah has spoken it.
\p
\v 9 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Jehovah; we
have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
\v 10 For in this mountain will the hand of Jehovah rest; and Moab shall be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden
down in the water of the dunghill.
\v 11 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth
his hands to swim; but Jehovah will lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands.
\v 12 And the high fortress of your walls has he brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.
