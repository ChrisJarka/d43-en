\q
\v 3 Their hands do evil proficiently,
\q The prince asks,
\q The judge is ready for a bribe,
\q And the powerful man tells the evil desire of his soul.
\q Thus they conspire together.
\q
\v 4 The best of them is like a brier,
\q The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.
\q The day of your watchmen,
\q Even your visitation comes,
\q Now their confusion comes.
