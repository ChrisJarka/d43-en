====== Personification ======

Personification is giving attributes human characteristics to a non-human object (i.e. thing, idea or animal).  Personification helps a writer to make something more vivid or life-like. It adds depth to writing and helps the reader 'feel' the subject matter more fully. 

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * If the personification would be understood correctly, use it.
  * Using the words "like" or "as" can help clarify that this is a figure of speech, as in 1 Thessalonians 5:4, "that the day should overtake you __like__  a thief"
  * If it wouldn't be understood correctly, find a way to translate it without the personification. For example, "The wisdom of God said" could be translating as "God in his wisdom said."

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Wisdom is justified by all her children.** Luke 7:35 (WEB)\\
Here Jesus spoke of wisdom as if it were a woman that has children. Wisdom's "children" are people who believe and follow wisdom. As a result of following God's wisdom they live wisely, and their wise behavior proves that God's wisdom is right.

**Therefore also __the wisdom of God said__, â€˜I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,** Luke 11:49 (WEB)\\
Here God's wisdom is personified as if it could speak.

===== Examples from English =====

**That delicious looking dessert is calling out to me, "Eat me. Eat me."** This personification helps to show how tempted the speaker feels to eat the cake. It also implies that the responsibility for the speaker's choice to eat the cake belongs to the cake.

**The raging fire devoured everything in its way.** \\
This description of the fire helps show how terrifying and destructive it was by comparing it to a wild animal that devours other animals.
