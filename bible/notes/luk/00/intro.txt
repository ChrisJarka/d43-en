=== What are the Synoptic Gospels? ===

The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the synoptic gospels because they share a large amount of textual material. However, the authors often used the same accounts and the same teachings of Jesus to emphasize different aspects of his life, ministry, and message.
