  * God told the Israelites to let the poor people and foreigners glean the leftover grain in order to provide food for themselves on a daily basis.
  * Sometimes the gleaners would just come later and pick up whatever was dropped by the harvesters. Other times, the owner of the field would generously allow the gleaners to go right behind the harvesters to glean which would give them much more grain.
  * A clear example of how this worked is in the story of Ruth, who was generously allowed to glean in the harvest fields of her relative Boaz.
  * Other ways to translate "glean" can be, "pick up" or "gather" or "collect",
