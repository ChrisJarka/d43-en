\c 17
\p
\v 1 And this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir the
firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
\v 2 So the lot was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of
Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children
of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their
families.
