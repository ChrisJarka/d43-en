===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - This is the end of the story of Uriah.
 
  * **Elnathan ... Achbor ... Ahikam ... Shaphan** - men's names (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **corpse** - "dead body"
  * **the hand of Ahikam** - Ahikam supported Jeremiah and protected him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the hand of Ahikam ... was with Jeremiah** - The hand is a metonym for the power that the hand exercises. Ahikam was not a soldier, so he probably was able to talk to people and change their minds. AT: "Ahikam ... was able to help Jeremiah" or "Ahikam ... was able to keep the people from harming Jeremiah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he was not given into the hand of the people to be put to death** - The hand is a metonym for the power that the hand exercises. This can be translated in active form. AT: "Ahikam did not allow the people to have the power to put Jeremiah to death" or "the people could not kill Jeremiah because Ahikam did not give them the power to" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
