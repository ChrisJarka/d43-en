\v 19 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke
of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over to him, and cast his mantle upon him.
\v 20 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will
follow thee. And he said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to thee?
