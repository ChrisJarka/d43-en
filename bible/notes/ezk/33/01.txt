\p
\v 1 And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of
the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman;
\v 3 if, when he sees the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
\v 4 then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and takes not warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood
shall be upon his own head.
