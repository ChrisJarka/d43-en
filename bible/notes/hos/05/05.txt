\v 5 And the pride of Israel does testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them.
\v 6 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find him: he has withdrawn himself from them.
\v 7 They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields.
