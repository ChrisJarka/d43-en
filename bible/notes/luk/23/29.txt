\v 30 Then, \add in order that they will not have to suffer greatly when their enemies destroy this city\add*, people who are left in the city will say to the mountains, 'Fall down on us!' And people will say to the hills, 'Cover us!'
\v 31 \add I am innocent\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add I am like\add* a living tree \add that people do not try to burn. But the people of Jerusalem deserve that their enemies punish them.

\v 29 I want you to know that there will soon be a time when people will say, 'Women  who have never borne children or nursed babies are fortunate!'
\v 30 Then, in order that they will not have to suffer greatly when their enemies destroy this city, people who are left in the city will say to the mountains, 'Fall down on us!' And people will say to the hills, 'Cover us!'
\v 31 I am innocent. I am like a living tree that people do not try to burn. But the people of Jerusalem deserve that their enemies punish them. They are like dry wood that is ready to burn. So if they nail me to the cross, their enemies will certainly do much worse things to them!"

\v 29 For behold, the days are coming, in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that did not bear, and the breasts that did not nurse.'
\v 30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us'; and to the hills, 'Cover us.'
\v 31 For if they do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"
