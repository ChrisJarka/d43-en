\v 1 Someone might say then, "If that is true, then it appears that there is no advantage to be a Jew over a non-Jew, and being circumcised does not benefit us Jews at all."
\v 2 But I tell you that being Jews has many benefits. First of all because it was to their ancestors that God spoke his words, words that show us who he is.

\v 1 Then what advantage does the Jew have? And what is the benefit of circumcision?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul proclaims the advantage that Jews have because God gave them his law.

  * **Then what advantage does the Jew have? And what is the benefit of circumcision?** - Paul presents ideas that people might have after they hear what he wrote in chapter 2. He does this in order to respond to them in verse 2. AT: "Some people might say, 'Then what advantage does the Jew have? And what is the benefit of circumcision?'" or "Some people might say, 'If that is true, then the Jews do not have any advantage, and there is no benefit in being circumcised.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **It is great in every way** - Paul now responds to the concerns brought up in verse 1. Here "It" refers to being a member of the Jewish people. AT: "But there is a great advantage to being a Jew!"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **First of all** - Possible meanings are 1) "First in order of time" or 2) "Most certainly" or 3) "Most importantly."
  * **the Jews were entrusted with revelation from God** - Here "revelation" refers to God's words and promises. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God gave his words that contain his promises to the Jews" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
