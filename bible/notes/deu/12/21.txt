  * **within your gates** - “within your community” or “inside your city.” Cities often had walls around them to keep out enemies, and gates for people to go in and out. (See: Metonymy)
  * **like the gazelle and the hart** - Yahweh identified in the law the animals that were acceptable for food such as the gazelle and hart. See Deut. 14:4,5. The hart is a deer.
