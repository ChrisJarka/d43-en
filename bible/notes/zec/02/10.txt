===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:en:obe:other:zion]]
  

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Ho**  - This term is an interjection/exclamation used by prophets. “Ho” is the pronunciation in the original Hebrew. This word indicates strong emotion and warning. It could mean “ah”, “alas”, or “woe”, but in this case is probably used to draw attention to what is being said. Most major English translations leave it out in this verse.
    * **daughter of Zion**  - This refers to the people of Jerusalem.  Since Jerusalem was the capital of Judah, it could refer to the people of Judah by extension.
    * **I/myself/He**  - These pronouns refer to Yahweh.
    * **encamp**  - This word literally means "to set up and use a camp."  It probably refers figuratively to  Yahweh's presence in the Tent of Meeting in the middle of Israel's camp during the exodus.  Similarly, he is coming back to Jerusalem.
    * **you**  - People of Jerusalem.
