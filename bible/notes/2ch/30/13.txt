\v 13 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great
assembly.
\v 14 And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast
them into the brook Kidron.
\v 15 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were
ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of Jehovah.
