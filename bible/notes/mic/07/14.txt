\v 14 Shepherd your people with your rod,
\q the flock of your inheritance.

\q Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead
\q as in the old days.
\q
\v 15 As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt,
\q I will show them wonders.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Shepherd your people with your rod, the flock of your inheritance** - Micah is praying to Yahweh, asking him to protect his people of Israel again. Here "rod" refers to God's leadership and guidance, as a shepherd uses a stick to guide and protect his sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They live alone in a thicket, in the midst of a pastureland** - Micah speaks of his people as if they were wild animals hiding in bushes instead of livestock grazing in fields with much grass to eat. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a thicket** - a place where many small woody plants grow
  * **Bashan and Gilead** - These regions are known as rich land for growing food.
  * **as in the old days** - Bashan and Gilead had been part of Israel long ago, when David was king. [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]
  * **As in the days ... them wonders** - Yahweh speaks to the people.
