\v 12 I am happy \add to say\add* that I have behaved toward all people \f + \ft metonymy \f* in an honest and sincere way. I am sure within myself \add that this is true\add*. Especially, I have behaved toward you \add honestly and sincerely because that is what\add* God wants us to do. As I have done that, \add my thoughts\add* have not been the thoughts that unbelieving people \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add think are\add* wise. Instead, \add I have behaved toward people only as God wants me to, depending on\add* God to help me in ways that I do not deserve.
\v 13 \add I say that\add* because \add in all my letters to you\add* I have always written \f + \ft litotes \f* clearly in a way that you can easily and completely understand \add when you\add* read them.
\v 14 \add Previously some of\add* you, but not all of you, have completely understood \add that I am always honest and sincere with you\add*. But I confidently expect that \add soon\add* you will all be fully convinced \add about that\add*. Then when the Lord Jesus \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add returns, you will all be able to say that\add* you are pleased with me, just like I will \add be able to say that\add* I am pleased with you.

\v 12 I am happy to say that I have behaved toward all people  in an honest and sincere way. I am sure within myself that this is true. Especially, I have behaved toward you honestly and sincerely because that is what God wants us to do. As I have done that, my thoughts have not been the thoughts that unbelieving people think are wise. Instead, I have behaved toward people only as God wants me to, depending on God to help me in ways that I do not deserve.
\v 13 I say that because in all my letters to you I have always written  clearly in a way that you can easily and completely understand when you read them.
\v 14 Previously some of you, but not all of you, have completely understood that I am always honest and sincere with you. But I confidently expect that soon you will all be fully convinced about that. Then when the Lord Jesus  returns, you will all be able to say that you are pleased with me, just like I will be able to say that I am pleased with you.

\v 12 We boast in the testimony of our conscience, that  we lived in the world with holiness and the sincerity of God, not according to earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and even more toward you.
\v 13 We do not write other things to you than what you read or understand--and I hope you will understand until the end--
\v 14 as you already understand us to some degree, that we are your boast, even as you also are ours, when the day of our Lord Jesus comes.
