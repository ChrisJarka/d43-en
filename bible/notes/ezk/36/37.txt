===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05|5:5]].
    * **I will show myself to this house of Israel when I do this for them** - This can be translated as "I will also do this for them; I will allow the house of Israel to ask me to do things for them."
    * **when I multiply their population like sheep** - "I will make them multiply like a flock of people." Sheep and goats multiply very quickly. Alternate translation: "I will make the people multiply very quickly like a flock of sheep or goats." ([[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
    * **Like the flocks reserved for the offerings** - Possible meanings are 1) "The people will be holy like a flock that is holy to Yahweh" or 2) "There will be as many people as the sheep and goats that are now sacrificed." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[en:obe:kt:consecrate]])
    * **like the flocks in Jerusalem at her appointed feasts** - Possible meanings are 1) "and like the huge number of people in Jerusalem for the feasts." Yahweh had commanded the people of Israel to come to Jerusalem for certain feasts, so during these feasts there was a very large number of people in Jerusalem. 2) "and like the huge number of sheep and goats in Jerusalem during the feasts." During the feasts, the people of Israel sacrificed very many animals, so there would have been very many animals in Jerusalem. (See: [[en:bible:notes:exo:23:14|Exodus 23:14]]-[[en:bible:notes:exo:23:16|17]]) 
    * **the desolate cities will be filled with flocks of people** - This can be translated as "each of the desolate cities will be fill such a flock of people." 
    * **will know that I am Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]].


    * ** flock of Jerusalem **  - The population of Jerusalem will be increased so it will be similar to a flock of sheep.
