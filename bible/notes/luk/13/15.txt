\v 15 Then the Lord replied to him, "You\add \f + \ft singular \f* and your fellow religious leaders are\add* hypocrites! On the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: On the our Jewish day of rest \f*, \add just like on every other day\add*, each of you unties his ox or donkey, and then leads it from the food trough to where it can drink water.\f + \ft Or: does not each of you untie his ox or donkey, and then lead it from the food trough to where it can drink water? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add That is work, too!\add*
\v 16 This woman \add is more important than an animal; she is a Jew\add*, descended from Abraham! But Satan has \add kept her\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add crippled\add* for eighteen years, \add as though\add* he had tied her \add and not let her escape!\add* So it is certainly right that she be freed \f + \ft Or:that \add I\add* free her \f*, \add even if this\add* is a Sabbath day!\f + \ft Or: was it not right that she be freed \f + \ft Or:that \add I\add* free her \f*, \add even if this\add* is a Jewish rest day? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"

\v 15 Then the Lord replied to him, "You and your fellow religious leaders are hypocrites! Each of you also works on the day of rest sometimes! Would you not untie your ox or donkey to lead it from the food trough to where it can drink water?
\v 16 This woman is a Jew, descended from Abraham! But Satan has kept her crippled for eighteen years, as though he had tied her up! Certainly you would agree that it is right that I free her from Satan, even if I do it on a day of rest!

\v 15 But the Lord answered him and said, "Hypocrites! Does not each of you untie your donkey or cow from its stall and lead it to drink on the Sabbath?
\v 16 So too this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, is it not necessary to untie her from her bonds on the Sabbath?"
