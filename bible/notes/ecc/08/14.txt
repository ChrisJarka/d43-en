====== Ecclesiastes 08:14-15 ======

\v 14 Another thing that \add sometimes\add* happens on this earth is that bad things happen to righteous people, and good things happen to evil people. It is difficult to understand why that happens.
\v 15 So I decided that I would recommend that people be happy while they are alive, because the best thing that people can do here on this earth is to eat and drink and be happy. Enjoying doing those things will help people while they do their work, all the days that God has given to them to remain alive here on the earth.

\v 14 There is another useless vapor—something else that is done on the earth. Things happen to righteous people as they happen to wicked people, and things happen to wicked people as they happen to righteous people. I say that this also is useless vapor.
\v 15 So I recommend happiness, because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat and drink and to be happy. It is happiness that will accompany him in his labor for all the days of his life that God has given him under the sun.
