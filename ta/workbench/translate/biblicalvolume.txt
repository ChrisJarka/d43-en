===== Description =====

The following terms are the most common units of volume used in the Bible to state how much a certain container could hold. The containers and measurements are given for both liquids (such as wine) and dry solids (such as grain). 

^  Type ^  Original Measure ^   Liters |
|  Dry |  omer |  2 liters |
|  Dry |  ephah |  22 liters |
|  Dry |  homer |  220 liters |
|  Dry |  kor |  220 liters |
|  Dry |  seah |  7.7 liters |
|  Liquid |  metrete |  40 liters |
|  Liquid |  bath |  22 liters |
|  Liquid |  hin |  3.7 liters |
|  Liquid |  kab |  1.23 liters |
|  Liquid |  log |  0.31 liters |

=== Translation Principles === 

Using the Bible terms can show that the Bible is true and that people actually used these units of measure during that time period.

==== Translation Strategies =====

  - Keep the Bible term and spell it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  - State the amount using a unit of measure that is known.
  - Use the Bible term and give the equivalent amount in the text or a note.

=== When the unit of measure is implied ===  
Sometimes the Hebrew does not specify a particular unit of volume but only uses a number. In these cases, many English versions, and the ULB and UDB, add the word "measure." For example in Haggai 2:16 it has, "twenty (measures) of grain" and "fifty (measures) of wine."

=== Translation Strategies.
  - Translate literally by using the number without giving a unit.\\
  - Use a generic word like "measure" or "quantity" or "portion." \\ 
  - Use the name of an appropriate container, such as "basket" for grain or "jar" for wine. \\ 
  - Use a unit of measure that you are already using in your translation.
