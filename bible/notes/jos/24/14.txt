\v 14 \add Then Joshua said to the people\add*, "\add Because of all that\add* Yahweh \add has done for you\add*, have an awesome respect for him, and serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* him very faithfully. Throw away the idols that your ancestors worshiped on the east\f + \ft Or: other \f* side of the Euphrates River and in Egypt. Serve only Yahweh.
\v 15 But if you do not want to serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* Yahweh, you should decide today what \add gods\add* you will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f*. You should decide whether you will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* the gods that your ancestors who lived on the other\f + \ft Or: east \f* side of the Euphrates River served, or whether you will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* the gods that the descendants of Amor, who previously lived in the land where you are now living, \add serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f*\add*. But as for me and my family \f + \ft metonymy \f*, we will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* Yahweh!"

\v 14 Now therefore fear Jehovah, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served
beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve you Jehovah.
\v 15 And if it seem evil to you to serve Jehovah, choose you this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your
fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we
will serve Jehovah.
