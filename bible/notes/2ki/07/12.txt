\v 12 And the king arose in the night, and said to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They
know that we are hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of
the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.
\v 13 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in
the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel
that are consumed); and let us send and see.
