**Preparation for the battle**

Saul had sent most of his army home. Then Jonathan attacked and defeated a Philistine garrison. That made the Philistines very angry and they brought a huge army into Israel and camped at the top of a hill. Most of Saul's army ran away and hid from the Philistines. Only Saul and Jonathan had swords because the Philistines would not allow the Israeli people to make swords or spears.
