v 13 But the tax collector, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but struck his breast, saying, God, be you merciful to me a sinner.
\v 14 I say to you, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalts himself shall be humbled; but he that humbles himself shall be exalted.
