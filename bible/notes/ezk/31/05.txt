===== Translation Notes: =====

The comparison of Assyria to a tree continues.

  * **higher than** **all the trees of the field**- This means this tree is <font 13px line-height: 19.5px background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)/Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;;inherit;;rgb(255, 255, 255)>above others.  Therefore, Assyria was higher than others in position, rank, or order. (See:Metaphor)</font>
  * <font 14px line-height: 19px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>** Its boughs grew long because of many waters as they went forth ** - "it grew strong because of all its resources"</font>
  * <font 14px line-height: 19px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>** every bird of the heavens nested in its branches  ** - "many nations depended upon Assyria"</font>
  * <font 14px line-height: 19px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>** every living thing of the field brings forth young under its foilage **</font> - This possibly indicates that Assyria helped many nations to profit.
  * **many nations dwell under its shade **- "Assyria protects many nations"
  * <font 14px line-height: 19px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>** the length of its branches, for its roots were in many waters!  ** - "Assyria's influence extended very far!"</font>
