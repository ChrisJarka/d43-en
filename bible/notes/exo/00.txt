**What is Exodus about?**\\
Exodus appears to be a continuation of the previous book, Genesis. It is the account in chronological order of the trials and slavery endured by the children of Israel, as well as their deliverance from Egypt. It describes how they received the Law of God to guide them in the way they should relate to him. Exodus is also about how they wandered in the wilderness before entering the Promised Land. 

**Who wrote Exodus?**\\
Exodus was written by Moses after the Exodus and before the entrance into the Promised Land, about 1450 BC. The place-names appear to be updated by later editors but the account is by an eyewitness of the events. (Exodus 17:14) Exodus is included in the first five biblical books, called the Pentateuch. This word is from the Greek language for “Five Books.”  

**What are the different parts of Exodus?**\\
The first half of Exodus is about Israel’s identity and history, and their faith in the One True God. The second half is about the Law and the failure of the people of Israel to obey the Law of God. The Law of Yahweh was given on Mount Sinai for all humanity. It was about the worship of Yahweh, and the protection of human lives, family, property, and relations with others. 

Exodus has instructions about how to build the Tabernacle, which the people of Israel carried through the wilderness. When they entered the Promised Land, the Tabernacle was set for many years in Shiloh until the time of Eli (about 1075 BC), when the Ark was taken by the Philistines). The Tabernacle contained the Ark of the Covenant, and the Holy of Holies (Leviticus 16, Day of Atonement). 

Summary verses: Exodus 34:5–7, Yahweh is “compassionate … yet will not leave the guilty unpunished.”
