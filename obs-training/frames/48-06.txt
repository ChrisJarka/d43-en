====== The Great High Priest [48-06] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-48-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

For hundreds of years, **[[:en:obe:kt:priest|priests]]**  continually offered **[[:en:obe:other:sacrifice|sacrifices]]** to **[[:en:obe:kt:god|God]]** for people to show the punishment that they deserved for their **[[:en:obe:kt:sin|sins]]**. But those sacrifices could not take away their sin. **[[:en:obe:kt:jesus|Jesus]]** is the **[[:en:obe:kt:highpriest|Great High Priest]]**. Unlike other priests, **he offered himself** as the only sacrifice that could take away the sin of all the people in the world. Jesus was the perfect high priest because he **took the [[:en:obe:other:punish|punishment]]** for every sin that anyone has ever committed.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he offered himself** - This could also be translated as, “Jesus allowed himself to be killed.”
  * **took the punishment** - That is, "received the punishment in his own body."
