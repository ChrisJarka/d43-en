\v 7 Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram
against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
\v 8 And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the
sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and killed them.
