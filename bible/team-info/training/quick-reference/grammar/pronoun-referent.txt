====== Pronoun Referent ======

===== Description =====

First person is how a speaker normally refers to himself. English has the first person pronouns ”I” and ”we”. (Also: me, my, mine, us, our, ours)

Second person is how a  speaker normally refers to the person or people he is speaking to. English uses the second person pronoun ”you.” (Also: your, yours)

Third person is how a speaker refers to someone else. English has the third person pronouns ”he”, ”she”, ”it” and ”they”. (Also: him, his, her, hers, its, them, their, theirs.)

In some languages, first, second and third person are usually shown with a prefix or suffix on a word, rather than with a personal pronoun.  You should do what is most natural in your language. Furthermore, in some languages (including Greek) using a personal pronoun indicates a special emphasis on the thing it refers to.  

  - People normally use first person pronouns when referring to themselves. 
    * The mother said to her young children, ”Stop fighting over the ball. Give it to me.”
  - But sometimes they use a noun instead of a pronoun.
    * The mother said to her young children, "Stop fighting over the ball. Give it to Mommy.
