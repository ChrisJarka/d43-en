\v 13 Then Delilah said, "You have deceived me and lied to me \add again\add*! Please tell me how someone can tie you up securely!" Samson replied, "If you weave the seven braids of my hair into the threads you are weaving on the loom, and then fasten those threads with the pin \add that makes the threads tight\add*, then I will be as weak as other men."
\p So again, while Samson was sleeping on her lap, Delilah held the seven braids of his hair, and wove them into the threads on the loom,
\v 14 and she tightened them with the pin. Then she called out, "Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!" But Samson woke up and pulled out the pin, and pulled his hair from the threads on the loom.

\v 13 Delilah said to Samson, “You have mocked me until now and told me lies. Tell me how you might be tied up.”
Samson said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the loom, I will be as any other man.”
\v 14 Delilah fastened his head with the pin and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson.” He woke up out of his sleep and plucked away the pin of the beam and the web.
