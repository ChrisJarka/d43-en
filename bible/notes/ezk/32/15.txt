<usfm>
\v 15 When I cause Egypt to become empty\f + \ft Or: desolate \f*
\q2 and strip off everything that grows on the land,
\q1 and when I get rid of all the people who live there,
\q2 people will know that it is I, Yahweh, \add who have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.'
\p
\v 16 That is the sad song that people will sing about Egypt.

<usfm>
\v 15 He also says this: "When I cause Egypt to become empty,
\q2 when I strip off everything that grows on the land,
\q1 and when I get rid of all the people who live there,
\q2 people will know that it is I, Yahweh, who have the power to do what I say that I will do.
\p
\v 16 That is the sad song that people will sing about Egypt.
\p Women of many nations will sing it;
\q2 they will chant it about Egypt and all its many people."
\q2 This will surely happen because Yahweh has said that it would happen.

<usfm>
\q
\v 15 When I make the land of Egyptan an abandoned place, when the land is stripped of all its fullness, 
\q when I attack all the inhabitants in her, they will know that I am Yahweh.
\q
\v 16 There will be this lament; the daughters of the nations will lament over her; they will lament over Egypt,
\q over all her multitudes they will lamentâ€”this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.'"
