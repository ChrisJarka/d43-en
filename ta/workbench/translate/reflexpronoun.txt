====== Reflexive Pronoun ======
Reflexive pronouns refer to someone who has already been referred to in a sentence. In English **the reflexive pronouns** are: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, and themselves. 

===== Functions of Reflexive Pronouns =====
  - To refer to a person or object that has already been mentioned in the sentence.  For example, in the sentence "I saw myself in the mirror” the word "myself" refers back to "I" and in the sentence ”The man bought himself a new shirt,” the word "himself" refers back to the "the man." 
  - To emphasize  a person or thing in the sentence, perhaps because it something that the listener might not expect. This may also imply a contrast with something else.  For example, "Mary herself bought the food" and "Mary bought the book herself" both emphasize that it was Mary who did it, not someone else.
  - To state that someone did something alone or without help. For example, "Frank read the book by himself" could mean that Frank did it alone or that he did it without any help. The context will show which meaning is intended.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  - Consider how the language indicates that something has already been referred to. Some languages may add something to the personal pronoun (as in English) or to some other part of the sentence.\\
  - Languages have different ways of showing that a certain person or thing is being emphasized. They may or may not use a reflexive pronoun to do this.\\
  - The idiom "by myself" could be translated as "alone" or "without help," depending on the context.
