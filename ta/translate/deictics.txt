Deictics are a word or phrase whose meaning depends on the time, place, and speaker; it is dependent on the context

==== Translation Suggestions ====

It is important that you understand the context of the original (SL) text (find additional resources if you need clarification). Make sure the TL text indicates the same contexts (people/places/times) indicated in the original. Sometimes, this may mean that a change in part of speech is necessary in order to be clear. For example, a pronoun may need to be translated as a (proper) noun used earlier in the text. Occasionally, the organization/ flow of the text may need to be altered to make the TL text clear.

Psalm 122:1-2

1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. 2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.

"they" refers to someone from a previous passage; the end of the direct communication is marked by a difference location: David (the writer of Psalm 122) is not in Jerusalem.

Psalm 2:7

7 I will tell the promise that he made to me: â€œYou are my son, because today I have begotten you".

Here, the pronoun changes, from 'he' to 'I' and 'me' to 'you', showing a change in speaker from David to God.

I am here now.

Out of context, we don't know who "I" refers to, where "here" is, or when I am here. I could be male or female, here could be Jakarta, Indonesia or Los Angeles, United States. Now could be August 7, 1982 or April 21, 2015. This sentence alone doesn't give us enough information to clarify this.
