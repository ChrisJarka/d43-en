====== hour ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "hour" is used in several different ways in the Bible. Often it means "time" or "moment."

  * A phrase like "in that very hour" means "at that moment" or "at that time."
  * Sometimes "hour" refers to a regular, set time to do something like "the hour of prayer."
  * Jewish daylight was divided into 12 hours, beginning with dawn and ending at sundown.
  * The Romans began their day at midnight and then counted 12 hours until noon and then 12 more hours until midnight.
  * Based on this, the "third hour of the day" means about 9:00 in the morning, and the "third hour of the night" is about 9:00 in the evening.
