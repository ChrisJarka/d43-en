\c 144
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Blessed be Jehovah my rock,
\q Who teaches my hands to war,
\q And my fingers to fight:
\q
\v 2 My lovingkindness, and my fortress,
\q My high tower, and my deliverer;
\q My shield, and he in whom I take refuge;
\q Who subdueth my people under me.
\q
\v 3 Jehovah, what is man, that you take knowledge of him?
\q Or the son of man, that you make account of him?
\q
\v 4 Man is like to vanity:
\q His days are as a shadow that passes away.
\q
\v 5 Bow your heavens, O Jehovah, and come down:
\q Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
\q
\v 6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them;
\q Send out your arrows, and discomfit them.
\q
\v 7 Stretch forth your hand from above;
\q Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters,
\q Out of the hand of aliens;
\q
\v 8 Whose mouth speaks deceit,
\q And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
\q
\v 9 I will sing a new song to thee, O God:
\q Upon a lute of ten strings will I sing praises to thee.
\q
\v 10 You are he that gives salvation to kings;
\q Who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
\q
\v 11 Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens,
\q Whose mouth speaks deceit,
\q And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
\b
\q
\v 12 When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth,
\q And our daughters as corner-stones hewn after the fashion of a palace;
\q
\v 13 When our garners are full, affording all manner of store,
\q And our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;
\q
\v 14 When our oxen are well laden;
\q When there is no breaking in, and no going forth,
\q And no outcry in our streets:
\q
\v 15 Happy is the people that is in such a case;
\q Yea, happy is the people whose God is Jehovah.
