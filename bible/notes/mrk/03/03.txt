===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Get up and stand here in the middle of everyone.**- "Get up and stand here in the middle of this crowd." 
  * **Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath day or to do harm; to save a life, or to kill? **- Under the rules of the Pharisees, it was legal to heal on the Sabbath only in the instance of life and death matters. Jesus knows the law. He asks the people this question to remind them of the laws. Alternate translation: "The law says to do good on the Sabbath; to save a life."  (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
