===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Howl in lament** - "Cry loudly and weep"
  * **Heshbon** - Translate the name of this city as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:48:01|48:2]]. Here "Heshbon" represents the people. AT: "people of Heshbon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for Ai will be devastated** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "for your enemies will devastate Ai" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **daughters of Rabbah** - Possible meanings are 1) "daughters" represent the women who live in Rabbah. AT: "women of Rabbah" or 2) all the people in general are spoken of as if they are the daughters of Rabbah. AT: "people of Rabbah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for Molech is going into captivity** - "for your enemies will take your god Molech captive." This means the enemies will take back to their land the idol that represents Molech.
  * **Why are you proud of your strength?** - Yahweh uses a question to scold the people. AT: "You should not be so proud because you really are not strong." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Your strength will flow away** - "Your strength will fail" or "You will become weak"
  * **faithless daughter** - Here, the people of Ammon are spoken of as if they were a daughter. AT: "faithless people" or "rebellious people" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **You say, 'Who will come against me?'** - The Ammonites use this question to state that they do not believe anyone can defeat them. It can be reworded as an indirect statement. AT: "You falsely think that no one can defeat you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
