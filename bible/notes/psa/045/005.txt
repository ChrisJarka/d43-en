\q
\v 5 Your arrows are sharp;
\q the peoples fall under you;
\q your arrows are in the hearts of the king’s enemies.
\q
\v 6 Your throne, God, is forever and ever;
\q a scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom.
\q
\v 7 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
\q therefore God, your God, has anointed you
\q with the oil of gladness more than your companions.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the peoples fall under you**  - This means the king's enemies die in battle. (See: Euphemism)
  * **the peoples fall…the king's enemies - **  These two lines express the same idea in two different ways. (See: Parallelism)
  * **Your throne, God, is forever and ever; a scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom -**  The author turns his attention from speaking to the king and speaks to God. (See: Apostrophe)
  * **has anointed**** you with the oil of gladness**- "Anointed" means to put oil on a king to appoint him for special service to God. The author uses "oil of gladness" to represent the joy that God gives the king. (See: Metaphor)
