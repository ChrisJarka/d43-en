\v 19 Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
\v 20 by the way which he established for us, a new and living way, through the curtain, that is to say, his flesh.
\v 21 And because we have a great priest over the house of God;
\v 22 let us draw near with a true heart in the assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having our body washed with pure water.
