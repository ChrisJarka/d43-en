\v 10 I request that you do something for Onesimus. He is now like a son of mine because I told him about Christ here in prison.
\v 11 Although his name, as you know, means "useful," he was useless to you in the past. But now he is useful both to you and to me!


\p
\v 12 Although he is very dear to me, I am sending him back to you.
\v 13 I would like to have kept him with me, in order that he might serve me in your place.  I need him because I am in prison because of my preaching the message about Christ.

\v 10 I ask you concerning my child Onesimus,  whom I have begotten in my bonds,
\v 11 who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable both to you and to me.
\v 12 I have sent him, himself, back to you, he who is my very heart:
\v 13 whom I would rather have kept with me, so that on your behalf he might help me, who am  in chains for the gospel.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Onesimus**  - This is the name of a man. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:translatenames|How to Translate Names]])
  * **my child Onesimus**  - This is a metaphor that means that Paul thought of Onesimus as a son. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **whom I have begotten**  - This is a metaphor and can be translated as "who became a son to me" or "who became like a son to me." How Onesimus became like a son to Paul can be made explicit: "who became my spiritual son when I taught him about Christ and he received new life" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **in my bonds**  - "in my chains." This can be translated as "while being in prison." Bonds is a metonym for prison. Paul was in prison when he taught Onesimus, and he was still in prison when he wrote this letter. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **who once was unprofitable**  - This could be translated as a new sentence: "Before he was useless."
  * **but now is profitable**  - "but now he is is useful." Translators may also add a footnote that says "The name Onesimus means 'profitable' or 'useful'."
  * **I have sent him, himself, back to you**  - "I have sent Onesimus back to you". Since Paul was probably writing the letter just before sending Onesimus, it could also be translated as "I am sending him back to you" (UDB).
  * **he who is my very heart**  - Here "heart" is used as a metonym for someone who is dearly loved. This phrase could be translated as "whom I love dearly." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **whom I would rather have kept with me**  - This could be translated as a new sentence: "I would rather have kept him with me."
  * **that on your behalf he might help me**  - "that, since you cannot be here, he might help me." It could also be translated as a separate sentence: He would be helping me in your place."
  * **who am in chains for the gospel**  - This can also be translated as "while I am in prison" or "because I am in prison."
  * **for the gospel**  - This can be translated here as "because I preach the gospel."
