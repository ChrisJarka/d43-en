===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 I solemnly tell you that \add as you keep in mind that\add* God and Christ Jesus and the holy angels know everything that you do, obey these commands \add about elders\add*! \add As you consider what others say about an elder doing wrong\add*, do not easily\f + \ft Or: quickly \f* decide that what they say is true. And treat them all equally.
\p
\v 22 Do not be in a hurry to put your hands on a man \add to set him apart\f + \ft Or: to appoint him\add* \f* \add as an elder. Wait until you have examined him to see how he conducts his life\add*, because \add God will consider\add* that you are responsible if \add you approve\add* a person who sins, saying that he should \add become an elder\add*. Keep your life pure in every way.

\v 21 I solemnly declare these things in the sight of God and of Christ Jesus and of the chosen angels, so that you may keep these things without pre-judgment and do nothing because of favoritism. 
\p
\v 22 Do not be quick to lay your hands in prayer upon anyone to commission them to do some work,  neither be a partner with a man in his sins. You should keep yourself pure.
