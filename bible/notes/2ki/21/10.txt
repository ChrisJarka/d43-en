\v 10 And Jehovah spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
\v 11 Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, that
were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols;
\v 12 therefore thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever
hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.
