\v 7 Are you not as the children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? says Jehovah. Have not I brought up Israel
out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
\v 8 Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth;
save that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, says Jehovah.
