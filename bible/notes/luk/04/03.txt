===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **If you are the Son of God **-That is, "'if you are really the Son of God." This was a challenge, "assuming you are indeed the Son of God, show it to me" or "you claim that you are the Son of God, do this." Some see it as recognition, "since you are the Son of God."
    * **command this stone to become bread**  - Literally, speak to this stone so that it might become bread." Possible translation, "tell this stone to become bread." The devil was either holding the stone in his hand or pointing to a nearby stone.
    * **It is written**- Rather "it has been written." This indicates authority and truthfulness, that is implying, "it is written in the Scriptures," or "it is written in the authoritative Scriptures."
    * **"Mankind cannot live on bread alone"**  - Literally, "a human being will not live on just bread". Possible translation, "It is not just bread that makes a person live." Bread was a staple food, something common to meet physical needs. H
    * **bread** - Here "bread" is used to refer to food in general. If people would understand it as saying that bread is not the only __food__ that people need to eat, it could also be translated as "food." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
