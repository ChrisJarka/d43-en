====== bread ======


===== Definition: =====

Bread is a food made from flour mixed with water and oil to form a dough. The dough is then shaped into a loaf and baked.

  * Bread dough is usually made with something that makes it rise, such as yeast.
  * Bread can also be made without yeast so that it does not rise. In the Bible this is called "unleavened bread" and was used for the Jews' passover meal.
  * Since bread was the main food for many people in biblical times, this term is often used in the Bible to refer to food in general, as in the phrase, "daily bread." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * The "bread of the presence" was a special kind of bread that was made specifically as a symbol of God's presence and of his fellowship with his people. Twelve loaves of this bread were kept on a special table outside the holy place of the tabernacle or temple. Every week the old bread would be eaten by the priests and they would place freshly made bread back on the table. This could be translated as "bread that symbolized God fellowshiping with them."
  * The figurative term, "bread from heaven" referred to the special white food called "manna" that God gave the Israelites when they were wandering through the desert.
  * Jesus also called himself the "bread that came down from heaven" and the "bread of life."
  * When Jesus and his disciples were eating the Passover meal together before his death, he compared the unleavened Passover bread to his body which would be wounded and killed on a cross.
