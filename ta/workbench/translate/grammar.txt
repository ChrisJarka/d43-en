===== Speech Quotations =====

In English there are direct or non-direct, or indirect, quotations.

  * DIRECT quotations are when the words that were said originally are used. (She said, “Come.” and then he said, “I will come.”)
  * INDIRECT or NON-DIRECT quotations are when the original words are changed. (She told him to come. He said he would come.) The quote marks ” ” are not used and often there is a change in the verb tense.
