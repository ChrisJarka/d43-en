<usfm>
\v 18 So, even though \add their leaders\add* made an idol that resembled a calf and insulted you by saying \add about the idol\add*, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,' you did not desert them.
\pi
\v 19 Because you always act mercifully, you did not abandon them when they were in the desert. The bright cloud which was like a huge pillar continued to lead them during the daytime, and the fiery cloud showed them where to walk at night.

\v 18 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God that brought you up out of Egypt, and had wrought
great provocations;
\v 19 yet you in your manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them
by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.
