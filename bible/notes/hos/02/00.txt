====== Hosea 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this which is a series of quotation. Chapter 1 and 2 is a single series forming one narrative.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==
Many relationships are used in this chapter that are metaphors for the relationship between Israel and her God (i.e. brother, sister, husband, wife, mother and children). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

This chapter creates an abrupt change of address. The prophet is now addressing the children directly in the first few verses but the whole chapter is written against Gomer as a type for Israel as an adulteress people. In some fashion, God has set Gomer up as a type to show the people of Israel how they are not to treat Him as their God.
