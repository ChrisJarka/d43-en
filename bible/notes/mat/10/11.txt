<usfm> \v 11-12 In any town or village that you enter, find a person who wants you to stay in his home. As you go into that house, call upon God to do good to the people who live there. Stay in that home until you leave that town or village. \v 13 If the people who live in that house receive you well, God will indeed do good to them. But if they do not receive you well, then your prayer will not help them, and God will not do them good. </usfm>
