<usfm>
\v 14 Those whom you appointed to teach others God's truth, keep reminding them about these things that I have told you. Warn them before God not to fight over foolish words, because doing so does not help anything and can ruin those who listen.
\p
\v 15 Do your best to cause God to approve you as a worker who has no need to be ashamed, who teaches the true Word of God correctly.

\v 14 Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God not to quarrel about words. Because of this there is nothing useful. Because of this there is destruction for those who listen.
