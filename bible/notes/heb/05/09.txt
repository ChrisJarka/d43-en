  * **Connecting Statement:** - In verse 11 the writer begins his third warning.  He warns these believers that they are still not mature and encourages them to learn God's word so they can understand right from wrong.

  * **perfected** - Here this means being made mature, able to honor God in all aspects of life.
  * **after the manner of Melchizedek** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:05:06|5:6]]
  * **you are dull of hearing** - The ability of understand and obey is spoken of as if it were the ability to listen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]].  And the ability to listen is spoken of as if it were a metal tool that becomes dull with use (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
