<usfm>
\q1 
\v 11 The more words that are spoken the more futillity increases, so what advantage is that to a man?
\v 12 For who knows what is good for man in his life, during the numbered days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow?
for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
