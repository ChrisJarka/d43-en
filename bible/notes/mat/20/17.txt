\v 18 "Listen carefully! We are now going up to Jerusalem. While we are there, someone will enable the chief priests and the men who teach the Jewish laws to seize me, the Son of Man, and they will put me on trial. They will condemn me and say that I should die.
\v 19 Then they will put me in the hands of non-Jews so that they can make fun of me, whip me, and kill me by nailing me to a cross. But on the third day after that, God will cause me to live again."

\v 17 As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said to them,
\v 18 "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes. They will 
condemn him to death
\v 19 and will deliver him to the Gentiles for them to mock him, scourge him, and crucify him. But on the third day he will be raised up."
