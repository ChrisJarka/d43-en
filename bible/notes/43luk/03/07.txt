    * **from the wrath that is coming**  - That is, "from the punishment that is coming." The word "wrath" is being used to refer to God's punishment because his wrath precedes it. This could also be translated as "from God's wrath" or "from God's punishment" or "from being punished." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy|Metonymy]])
    * **wrath **- That is, anger that slowly builds up over a period of time as opposed to a sudden outburst of anger.
