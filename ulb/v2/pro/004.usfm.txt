\q
\v 1 Hear, my sons, the instruction of a father,
\q And attend to know understanding:
\q
\v 2 For I give you good doctrine;
\q Forsake you not my law.
\q
\v 3 For I was a son to my father,
\q Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
\q
\v 4 And he taught me, and said to me:
\q Let your heart retain my words;
\q Keep my commandments, and live;
\q
\v 5 Get wisdom, get understanding;
\q Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;
\q
\v 6 Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee;
\q Love her, and she will keep thee.
\q
\v 7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom;
\q Yea, with all your getting get understanding.
\q
\v 8 Exalt her, and she will promote thee;
\q She will bring you to honor, when you do embrace her.
\q
\v 9 She will give to your head a chaplet of grace;
\q A crown of beauty will she deliver to thee.
\b
\q
\v 10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings;
\q And the years of your life shall be many.
\q
\v 11 I have taught you in the way of wisdom;
\q I have led you in paths of uprightness.
\q
\v 12 When you goest, your steps shall not be straitened;
\q And if you runnest, you shall not stumble.
\q
\v 13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go:
\q Keep her; for she is your life.
\q
\v 14 Enter not into the path of the wicked,
\q And walk not in the way of evil men.
\q
\v 15 Avoid it, pass not by it;
\q Turn from it, and pass on.
\q
\v 16 For they sleep not, except they do evil;
\q And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
\q
\v 17 For they eat the bread of wickedness,
\q And drink the wine of violence.
\q
\v 18 But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light,
\q That shineth more and more to the perfect day.
\q
\v 19 The way of the wicked is as darkness:
\q They know not at what they stumble.
\b
\q
\v 20 My son, attend to my words;
\q Incline your ear to my sayings.
\q
\v 21 Let them not depart from your eyes;
\q Keep them in the midst of your heart.
\q
\v 22 For they are life to those that find them,
\q And health to all their flesh.
\q
\v 23 Keep your heart with all diligence;
\q For out of it are the issues of life.
\q
\v 24 Put away from you a wayward mouth,
\q And perverse lips put far from thee.
\q
\v 25 Let your eyes look right on,
\q And let your eyelids look straight before thee.
\q
\v 26 Make level the path of your feet,
\q And let all your ways be established.
\q
\v 27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left:
\q Remove your foot from evil.
