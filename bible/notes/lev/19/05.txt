<usfm>
\v 5 When you bring an offering to maintain fellowship with me, offer it in a way that will cause me to accept it.
\v 6 The meat should be eaten on the day that you sacrifice it, but you are permitted to eat some of it on the next day. Anything that remains until the third\f + \ft Or: next \f* day must be completely burned.
\v 7 For any of it to be eaten on the third day is very displeasing to me, and I will not accept that offering.
\v 8 I will punish anyone who eats it \add after the second day\add*, because he will have not respected what I say is holy. And that person must no longer be allowed to associate with my people.

\v 5 And when you offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah, you shall offer it that you may be accepted.
\v 6 It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the morrow: and if anything remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.
\v 7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted:
\v 8 but every one that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy thing of Jehovah: and that soul shall be cut off from his people.
