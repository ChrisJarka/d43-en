\c 27

\v 1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder
son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Here am I.
\v 2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.
\v 3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison;
\v 4 and make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless you before I die.
\p
\v 5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
\v 6 And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,
\v 7 Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Jehovah before my death.
\v 8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
\v 9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory food for your father,
such as he loveth:
\v 10 and you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.
\v 11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
\v 12 My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a
blessing.
\v 13 And his mother said to him, Upon me be your curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
\v 14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.
\v 15 And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her
younger son;
\v 16 and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:
\v 17 and she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
\p
\v 18 And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who are thou, my son?
\v 19 And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your first-born; I have done according as you commanded me: arise, I pray thee,
sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.
\v 20 And Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah your God
sent me good speed.
\v 21 And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether you be my very son Esau or not.
\v 22 And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the
hands of Esau.
\v 23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.
\v 24 And he said, Are you my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
\v 25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near
to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.
\v 26 And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
\v 27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said,
\q See, the smell of my son
\q Is as the smell of a field which Jehovah has blessed:
\q
\v 28 And God give you of the dew of heaven,
\q And of the fatness of the earth,
\q And plenty of grain and new wine:
\q
\v 29 Let peoples serve thee,
\q And nations bow down to thee.
\q Be lord over your brethren,
\q And let your mother’s sons bow down to thee:
\q Cursed be every one that curses thee,
\q And blessed be every one that blesses thee:
\p
\v 30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the
presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
\v 31 And he also made savory food, and brought it to his father; and he said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat
of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me.
\v 32 And Isaac his father said to him, Who are thou? And he said, I am your son, your first-born, Esau.
\v 33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he that has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have
eaten of all before you camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.
\v 34 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless
me, even me also, O my father.
\v 35 And he said, Your brother came with guile, and has taken away your blessing.
\v 36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and,
behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast you not reserved a blessing for me?
\v 37 And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for
servants; and with grain and new wine have I sustained him: and what then shall I do for thee, my son?
\v 38 And Esau said to his father, Hast you but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau
lifted up his voice, and wept.
\v 39 And Isaac his father answered and said to him,
\q Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be your dwelling,
\q And of the dew of heaven from above;
\q
\v 40 And by your sword shall you live, and you shall serve your brother;
\q And it shall come to pass, when you shall break loose,
\q That you shall shake his yoke from off your neck.
\p
\v 41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of
mourning for my father are at hand; then will I kill my brother Jacob.
\v 42 And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah.; and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to
him, Behold, your brother Esau, as touching thee, does comfort himself,
purposing to kill thee.
\v 43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee you to Laban my brother to Haran;
\v 44 and wait with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turn away;
\v 45 until your brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which you have done to him: then I will send, and
fetch you from thence: why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?
\p
\v 46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters
of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
