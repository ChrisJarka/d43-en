====== Thomas ======

===== Facts: =====

Thomas was one of twelve men whom Jesus chose to be his disciples and later, apostles. He was also known as "Didymus" which means "twin."

  * Thomas is best known for saying that he would not believe that Jesus was alive again unless he could see and feel the places where Jesus had been wounded.
  * It was also Thomas who asked Jesus to explain how they could know the way to go to the Father. Jesus answered by telling his disciples, "I am the Way and the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."
