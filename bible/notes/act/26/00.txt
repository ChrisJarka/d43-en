====== Acts 26 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This is the third account of Paul's conversion in the book of Acts. Because this is such an important event in the early church, there are three accounts of Paul's convserion (see: Acts 9 and 22).

This chapter functions as a type of legal defense that Paul give concerning his actions. He lays out the fact refuting the charges brought against him.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Light and Darkness ==
These are common images in the New Testament. Light is used here to indicate the revelation of God and his righteousness. Darkness describes [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] and sin seeks to remain hidden from God.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== ""I am Jesus" ==

The text does not make it explicitly clear, but this is Jesus after he was raised from the dead. He was only visible to Saul.
