\c 18
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the servant of Jehovah, who spoke to Jehovah the words of this song in
the day that Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: and he said,
\q
\v 1 I love thee, O Jehovah, my strength.
\q
\v 2 Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
\q My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge;
\q My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.
\q
\v 3 I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised:
\q So shall I be saved from mine enemies.
\q
\v 4 The cords of death compassed me,
\q And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
\q
\v 5 The cords of Sheol were round about me;
\q The snares of death came upon me.
\q
\v 6 In my distress I called upon Jehovah,
\q And cried to my God:
\q He heard my voice out of his temple,
\q And my cry before him came into his ears.
\q
\v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled;
\q The foundations also of the mountains quaked
\q And were shaken, because he was wroth.
\q
\v 8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,
\q And fire out of his mouth devoured:
\q Coals were kindled by it.
\q
\v 9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down;
\q And thick darkness was under his feet.
\q
\v 10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly;
\q Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind.
\q
\v 11 He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him,
\q Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
\q
\v 12 At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,
\q Hailstones and coals of fire.
\q
\v 13 Jehovah also thundered in the heavens,
\q And the Most High uttered his voice,
\q Hailstones and coals of fire.
\q
\v 14 And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them;
\q Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.
\q
\v 15 Then the channels of waters appeared,
\q And the foundations of the world were laid bare,
\q At your rebuke, O Jehovah,
\q At the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
\q
\v 16 He sent from on high, he took me;
\q He drew me out of many waters.
\q
\v 17 He delivered me from my strong enemy,
\q And from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
\q
\v 18 They came upon me in the day of my calamity;
\q But Jehovah was my stay.
\q
\v 19 He brought me forth also into a large place;
\q He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
\q
\v 20 Jehovah has rewarded me according to my righteousness;
\q According to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.
\q
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,
\q And have not wickedly departed from my God.
\q
\v 22 For all his ordinances were before me,
\q And I put not away his statutes from me.
\q
\v 23 I was also perfect with him,
\q And I kept myself from mine iniquity.
\q
\v 24 Therefore has Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness,
\q According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
\q
\v 25 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful;
\q With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect;
\q
\v 26 With the pure you will show yourself pure;
\q And with the perverse you will show yourself froward.
\q
\v 27 For you will save the afflicted people;
\q But the haughty eyes you will bring down.
\q
\v 28 For you will light my lamp:
\q Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness.
\q
\v 29 For by you I run upon a troop;
\q And by my God do I leap over a wall.
\q
\v 30 As for God, his way is perfect:
\q The word of Jehovah is tried;
\q He is a shield to all them that take refuge in him.
\q
\v 31 For who is God, save Jehovah?
\q And who is a rock, besides our God,
\q
\v 32 The God that girdeth me with strength,
\q And makes my way perfect?
\q
\v 33 He makes my feet like hindsâ€™ feet:
\q And sets me upon my high places.
\q
\v 34 He teaches my hands to war;
\q So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.
\q
\v 35 You have also given me the shield of your salvation;
\q And your right hand has holden me up,
\q And your gentleness has made me great.
\q
\v 36 You have enlarged my steps under me,
\q And my feet have not slipped.
\q
\v 37 I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them;
\q Neither will I turn again till they are consumed.
\q
\v 38 I will strike them through, so that they shall not be able to rise:
\q They shall fall under my feet.
\q
\v 39 For you have girded me with strength to the battle:
\q You have subdued under me those that rose up against me.
\q
\v 40 You have also made mine enemies turn their backs to me,
\q That I might cut off them that hate me.
\q
\v 41 They cried, but there was none to save;
\q Even to Jehovah, but he answered them not.
\q
\v 42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind;
\q I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.
\q
\v 43 You have delivered me from the strivings of the people;
\q You have made me the head of the nations:
\q A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
\q
\v 44 As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me;
\q The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.
\q
\v 45 The foreigners shall fade away,
\q And shall come trembling out of their close places.
\q
\v 46 Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock;
\q And exalted be the God of my salvation,
\q
\v 47 Even the God that executes vengeance for me,
\q And subdueth peoples under me.
\q
\v 48 He rescueth me from mine enemies;
\q Yea, you lift me up above them that rise up against me;
\q You deliver me from the violent man.
\q
\v 49 Therefore I will give thanks to thee, O Jehovah, among the nations,
\q And will sing praises to your name.
\q
\v 50 Great deliverance gives he to his king,
\q And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed,
\q To David and to his seed, for evermore.
