**[[:en:obe:other:paul|Paul]]** and **[[:en:obe:other:silas|Silas]]** often met with people at the place of **[[:en:obe:other:pray|prayer]]**. Every day as they walked there, a **[[:en:obe:other:servant|slave girl]]** **[[:en:obe:kt:demon-possessed|possessed by a demon]]** followed them. By means of this **[[:en:obe:kt:demon|demon]]** she predicted the future for people, so she made a lot of money for **her [[:en:obe:kt:lord|masters]]** **as a fortuneteller**.

===== Translation Notes: =====

   * **her masters** - In this case, this could also be translated as, "her owners."
   * **as a fortuneteller** - That is, "as someone who told people what would happen to them in the future."
