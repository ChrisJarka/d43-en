====== Anthropomorphism ======

Anthropomorphism is a figure of speech in which a speaker or writer speaks of God or animals as though they have traits or behaviors that usually only humans have.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Anthropomorphism is a figure of speech and therefore should not be taken literally. The Bible is not saying that God has hands, or eyes, or ears, nor does he need to rest. Instead, the biblical writers use this kind of figure of speech as a way to help their readers understand God through a comparison with normal human terms and conditions.

Normally, this figure of speech can be translated with good understanding. But if the people misunderstand the figure and take it to mean that God has a human body or other human limitations, language can be used that is not figurative. For example, Exodus 7:4 says, "I (God) will put __my hand __ on Egypt." In this context, God is talking about punishing Egypt. So you could translate, "I will __punish __ the people of Egypt."

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Exodus 7:5 "And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when __I stretch out My hand__ on Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their midst.”

Psalm 34:15 __The eyes of the Lord__ are toward the righteous, and __His ears__ are open to their cry."

Gen. 2:2, "And by the seventh day God completed His work which He had done; and __He rested__ on the seventh day from all His work which He had done."
