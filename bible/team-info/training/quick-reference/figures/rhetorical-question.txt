====== Rhetorical Question ======

===== Description =====

A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. An answer is not expected for rhetorical questions. A rhetorical question may be used to express deep emotion or to encourage the reader to think deeply on a topic. At times, rhetorical questions are used for sarcasm, rebuking or scolding.
