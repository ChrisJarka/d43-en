\q
\v 1 O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is your name in all the earth,
\q Who have set your glory upon the heavens!
\q
\v 2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have you established strength,
\q Because of your adversaries,
\q That you might still the enemy and the avenger.
\q
\v 3 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,
\q The moon and the stars, which you have ordained;
\q
\v 4 What is man, that you are mindful of him?
\q And the son of man, that you visit him?
\q
\v 5 For you have made him but little lower than God,
\q And crownest him with glory and honor.
\q
\v 6 You make him to have dominion over the works of your hands;
\q You have put all things under his feet:
\q
\v 7 All sheep and oxen,
\q Yea, and the beasts of the field,
\q
\v 8 The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,
\q Whatsoever passes through the paths of the seas.
\q
\v 9 O Jehovah, our Lord,
\q How excellent is your name in all the earth!
