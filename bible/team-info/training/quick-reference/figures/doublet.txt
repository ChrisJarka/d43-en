====== Doublet ======


===== Description =====

In a **doublet** two words or two phrases that mean basically the same thing are used together–-typically, as a way to reinforce the concept. The two words are often joined with "and."  In the Bible, doublets are often used in poetry, prophecy, and sermons.

=== Isaiah 6:1 === 
**on a high and elevated throne** - The words “high” and “elevated” mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. The height of the throne emphasizes the supreme authority and holiness of the Lord. Alternate translation: “on a throne that was raised up very high” (See: Doublet)

=== Luke 1:71 ===

"He promised to provide for us salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of everyone who hates us."

  * **(1) enemies…everyone who hates us**  - **(3)**  These two phrases  both refer to those who are against God's people. **(4)** Alternate translation: "people who fight against us and want to harm us." **(5)**  (See: Doublet)

=== 2 Thessalonians 1:4 ===

"So we ourselves speak proudly about you among the churches of God concerning your patience and faith in all your persecutions and afflictions that you endure. "

  * **(1) your persecutions and afflictions**  - **(3)**  This says the same thing in different ways to emphasize the how badly they were being treated by their enemies. **(4)** Alternate translation: "your severe persecutions." **(5)**  (See: Doublet)
