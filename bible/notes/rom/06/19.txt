\v 19 I am illustrating what I say \add by talking about slavery\add* because your human nature prevents you from understanding \add spiritual truth\add* easily. \add In the past\add* you willingly did the immoral and unlawful things that \add your minds compelled\add* your bodies to do \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like\add* slaves \add do what their masters compel them to do\add*. As a result, you did even more unlawful things. Now, \add you need to\add* willingly allow \add your minds to compel\add* your bodies to \add act\add* righteously \f + \ft metaphor \f*, in order that you will behave in a holy\f + \ft Or: pure \f* way.
\v 20 When you were \add like\add* slaves \add because your sinful desires compelled you to do\add* sinful things \f + \ft metaphor \f*, you were not \add concerned about behaving\add* righteously \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 21 Nevertheless, \add doing\add* those things resulted in your being separated from God, so you did not benefit at all from \add doing\add* the \add sinful\add* things that you are now ashamed of.\f + \ft Or: what did you gain from \add doing\add* the things that you are now ashamed of? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 19 I am writing to you in a parable that people can understand, to help you understand the truth about yourselves and God. In the past, you were slaves to your minds; you did all kinds of impure and evil things, the things that your minds told you to do. But now, allow God, who is righteous, to control you as his slaves, so that he will set you apart for himself as his people.
\v 20 It is true that in the past, you behaved as people who were free from God's power and righteousness (because you did whatever your evil minds told you to do). You did not have to do things that were right.
\v 21 But what good was that freedom to you? Doing those things that you are now ashamed of just meant you would have to be apart from God forever.

\v 19 I speak like a man because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your body parts as slaves to uncleanness and to evil, thus now present your body parts as slaves to righteousness for sanctification.
\v 20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness.
\v 21 What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I speak like a man** - Paul is describing "sin" and "obedience" as "slavery" which is an image that people in the Roman Empire would understand. Alternate translation: "I am speaking about slavery to describe sin and obedience."
  * **because of the weakness of the flesh** - Often Paul uses the word "flesh" as the opposite of "spirit." Alternate translation: "because you do not fully understand spiritual things."
  * **presented your body parts as slaves to uncleanness and to evil** - Here, "body parts" refers to the whole person. Alternate translation: "offered yourselves as slaves to everything that is evil and not pleasing to God."
  * **present your body parts as slaves to righteousness for sanctification** - "offer yourselves as slaves to what right before God and he will make you pure." ​
  * **What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed?**- Paul is using a question to emphasize that sinning results in nothing good. Alternate translation: "You gained nothing by doing those things that now cause you shame."(See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
