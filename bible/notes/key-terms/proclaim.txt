====== proclaim ======

===== Definition: =====

\\
To proclaim is to announce or declare something publicly and boldly.

  * Often in the Old Testament, "proclaim" means to announce publicly something that God has commanded to be done or to declare to others about God's character and how great he is.
  * Often in the New Testament, proclaiming has to do with teaching the good news about Jesus to many people in many different cities and regions.
  * When “proclaim” is not related to God or the good news, it can refer to decrees made by kings or to sin, evil, or false teaching about God.
  * Other ways to translate "proclaim" could include "openly preach (the word of God)" or "publicly declare (the good news about Jesus)" or "announce".
