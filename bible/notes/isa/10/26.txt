<usfm>
\v 26 Then Yahweh of Hosts will wield a whip against them, like when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb. He will raise his rod over the sea and lift it up as he did in Egypt.
\v 27 In that day,
\q1 his burden is lifted from your shoulder and his yoke from off your neck, 
\q1 and the yoke will be destroyed because your neck will be too fat for it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Yahweh of Hosts** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].
  * **will wield a whip against them** - "will beat the Assyrians with a whip." God will not really use a whip. This refers to God's power to punish the Assyrians severely. Alternate translation: "will punish the Assyrians severely as if with a whip" (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **like when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb** - This refers to when God helped a man named Gideon defeat the army of Midian. (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]])
  * **He will raise his rod over the sea and lift it up as he did in Egypt** - This refers to when God caused the water of the Red Sea to split so the people of Israel could escape from the Egyptian army and so that the Egyptian army would drown in it. Alternate translation: "He will help you escape from the army of Assyria as he helped your ancestors escape the army of Egypt."
  * **In that day** - See how you translated the similar phrase in [[en:bible:notes:isa:02:09|2:11]].
  * **his burden is lifted from your shoulder and his yoke from off your neck** - "Yahweh will lift the burden that Assyria has put on your shoulder, and he will remove the yoke that Assyria has put on your back." These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The words "burden" and "yoke" refer to slavery. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will remove the army of Assyria who oppresses and enslaves you" or Yahweh will stop the Assyrians from making you slaves." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]],  [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]] and [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **Aiath…Migron…Michmash…Geba…Ramah…Gibeah** - These are all cities and villages near Jerusalem that the army of Assyria went through and caused trouble in.  (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]])
  * **Ramah trembles and Gibeah of Saul has fled** - "The people of Ramah tremble and the people of Gibeah of Saul have fled"
