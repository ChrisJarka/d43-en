===== Translation Notes: =====

Now the Psalmist writes the words that Yahweh spoke.

  * **Meribah,...Massah** - Both words refer to a place in the dessert that Moses named because the Israelites rebelled against God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **challenged my authority and tried my patience** - These two phrases have similar meanings. AT: "tried my patience by challenging my authority" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **my deeds** - AT: "the amazing things I had done."
