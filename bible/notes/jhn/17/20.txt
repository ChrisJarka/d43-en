===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **world** - This refers to the people of the world.
  * **they may all be one...as you, Father, are in me, and I am in you...they also may be in us** - God the Father is in God the Son and the Son is in Father. Those who trust in Jesus, God the Son, then become one with the Father and the Son when they believe. The words "Father" and "Son" show the closeness and compassion of the persons of God for one another. "Father" and "Son" must be translated literally to reveal God with the words God has chosen to use to describe himself.
