===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **They will do these things**  - The words "these things" refer to the actions in verses 1-2. Alternate translation: "They will do these evil deeds" or "They will do these evil works"
    * **I have spoken these things to you**  - "I have informed you" or "I have told you this information." This is a different meaning of the word "things" here. Doing things implies deeds and speaking things implies passing on information.
    * **in the beginning** - This has the meaning "from the very first days when I began to teach" as in [[en:bible:notes:jhn:15:27|15:27]]
