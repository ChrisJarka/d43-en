\v 4 And so it was just as Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them that they ran away and went out by night from the city by the garden path of the king 
through the gate between the walls, and he went out on the way to the steppes.
\v 5 But the army of Chaldeans pursued after them and overtook Zedekiah on the plains of Jericho. Then they took him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, 
to Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he declared judgment against him.
