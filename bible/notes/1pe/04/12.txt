\v 12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you, which comes upon you to prove you, as though a strange thing happened to you:
\v 13 but insomuch as you are partakers of Christâ€™s sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory also you may rejoice with exceeding joy.
\v 14 If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are ye; because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you.
