\v 1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
\q
\v 2 Can a man be profitable to God?
\q Surely he that is wise is profitable to himself.
\q
\v 3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous?
\q Or is it gain to him, that you make your ways perfect?
\q
\v 4 Is it for your fear of him that he reproves thee,
\q That he enters with you into judgment?
\q
\v 5 Is not your wickedness great?
\q Neither is there any end to your iniquities.
\q
\v 6 For you have taken pledges of your brother for nought,
\q And stripped the naked of their clothing.
\q
\v 7 You have not given water to the weary to drink,
\q And you have withholden bread from the hungry.
\q
\v 8 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth;
\q And the honorable man, he lived in it.
\q
\v 9 You have sent widows away empty,
\q And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
\q
\v 10 Therefore snares are round about thee,
\q And sudden fear troubleth thee,
\q
\v 11 Or darkness, so that you can not see,
\q And abundance of waters cover thee.
\b
\q
\v 12 Is not God in the height of heaven?
\q And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
\q
\v 13 And you sayest, What does God know?
\q Can he judge through the thick darkness?
\q
\v 14 Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he sees not;
\q And he walks on the vault of heaven.
\q
\v 15 Wilt you keep the old way
\q Which wicked men have trodden?
\q
\v 16 Who were snatched away before their time,
\q Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,
\q
\v 17 Who said to God, Depart from us;
\q And, What can the Almighty do for us?
\q
\v 18 Yet he filled their houses with good things:
\q But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
\q
\v 19 The righteous see it, and are glad;
\q And the innocent laugh them to scorn,
\q
\v 20 Saying, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off,
\q And the remnant of them the fire has consumed.
\b
\q
\v 21 Acquaint now yourself with him, and be at peace:
\q Thereby good shall come to thee.
\q
\v 22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,
\q And lay up his words in your heart.
\q
\v 23 If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up,
\q If you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.
\q
\v 24 And lay you your treasure in the dust,
\q And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks;
\q
\v 25 And the Almighty will be your treasure,
\q And precious silver to thee.
\q
\v 26 For then shall you delight yourself in the Almighty,
\q And shall lift up your face to God.
\q
\v 27 You shall make your prayer to him, and he will hear thee;
\q And you shall pay your vows.
\q
\v 28 You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to thee;
\q And light shall shine upon your ways.
\q
\v 29 When they cast you down, you shall say, There is
lifting up;
\q And the humble person he will save.
\q
\v 30 He will deliver even him that is not innocent:
\q Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.
