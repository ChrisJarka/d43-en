===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Indeed, he said to me**- That is, "he even said to me," indicating that what follows is the most important part of Boaz's words to Ruth.
  * **You shall keep close** -  "Shall" is to exhort or command. "You must keep close" or "Ruth, keep close".
  * **come to harm**  - Most interpreters take Naomiâ€™s words to mean that she is concerned that other workers might abuse Ruth physically or sexually. Another interpretation, Naomi is concerned that in another field, the owner would interfere or stop her from gleaning until the end of the harvest (see note on 1:22).
