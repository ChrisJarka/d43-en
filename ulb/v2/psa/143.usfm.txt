\c 143
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Hear my prayer, O Jehovah; give ear to my supplications:
\q In your faithfulness answer me, and in your righteousness.
\q
\v 2 And enter not into judgment with your servant;
\q For in your sight no man living is righteous.
\q
\v 3 For the enemy has persecuted my soul;
\q He has struck my life down to the ground:
\q He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.
\q
\v 4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me;
\q My heart within me is desolate.
\q
\v 5 I remember the days of old;
\q I meditate on all your doings;
\q I muse on the work of your hands.
\q
\v 6 I spread forth my hands to thee:
\q My soul thirsteth after thee, as a weary land. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 7 Make haste to answer me, O Jehovah; my spirit faileth:
\q Hide not your face from me,
\q Lest I become like them that go down into the pit.
\q
\v 8 Cause me to hear your lovingkindness in the morning;
\q For in you do I trust:
\q Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk;
\q For I lift up my soul to thee.
\q
\v 9 Deliver me, O Jehovah, from mine enemies:
\q I flee to you to hide me.
\q
\v 10 Teach me to do your will;
\q For you are my God:
\q Your Spirit is good;
\q Lead me in the land of uprightness.
\q
\v 11 Quicken me, O Jehovah, for your nameâ€™s sake:
\q In your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
\q
\v 12 And in your lovingkindness cut off mine enemies,
\q And destroy all them that afflict my soul;
\q For I am your servant.
