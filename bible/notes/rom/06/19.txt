\v 19 I am illustrating what I say by talking about slavery because your human nature prevents you from understanding spiritual truth easily. In the past you willingly did the immoral and unlawful things that your minds compelled your bodies to do just like slaves do what their masters compel them to do. As a result, you did even more unlawful things. Now, you need to willingly allow your minds to compel your bodies to act righteously, in order that you will behave in a holy way.
\v 20 When you were like slaves because your sinful desires compelled you to do sinful things, you were not concerned about behaving righteously.
\v 21 Nevertheless, doing those things resulted in your being separated from God, so you did not benefit at all from doing the sinful things that you are now ashamed of.

\v 19 I speak like a man because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and to evil, thus now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification.
\v 20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness.
\v 21 What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death.
