\v 9 The message \add that Moses taught them was wonderful, but when people heard\add* that message, \add they realized that they were sinners and that God\add* would punish them. But God's message that we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* teach is a\add* much more wonderful message. We teach people that God will erase the record of\f + \ft Or: declare people no longer guilty for \f* \add the sinful things that they have done\add*.
\v 10 \add The truth is that, although the work of teaching the people to obey God's laws\add* was once important, it is not as important now, because \add the work of teaching people that God will forgive them and\add* enable them to live to please him is far more important.
\v 11 Furthermore, \add the message that Moses taught was not a lasting message, just like\add* the brightness on his face was not lasting and soon faded away. But \add when God gives his Spirit to people\add*, the wonderful work that \add God's Spirit does in their lives\add* is much greater \add because\add* it lasts forever.

\v 9 Even the ministry of the law shined for a while with the light from God. But the law could only bring condemnation and it could never rescue anyone from the sins. But how much more does the light of God shine out of the ministry that makes us right with God through the death of Christ on the cross!
\v 10 The light that shined from God in the lawâ€”the people saw that light on the mountain where the law was given. But now there is another light that shines from God, and it will shine with even more brightly that light from God.
\v 11 When God gave the law, he shined the light from God upon it. But that light came to an end. But how much more will he shine the light from God, on the Good News that will never fade away.

\v 9 For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, how much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory!
\v 10 For indeed that which was once made glorious is no longer glorious in this respect, because of the glory that surpasses it.
\v 11 For if that which came to an end had glory, how much more will what is permanent have glory!
