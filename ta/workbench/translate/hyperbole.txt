====== Hyperbole ======


This module answers the question: What is the literary device called hyperbole?\\ Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

Hyperbole describes something as larger or greater than it really is to show how strongly the speaker feels about it. Hyperbole is a deliberate, often extreme or even unreal exaggeration used to emphasize a speaker’s feeling or opinion about something. 

===== Description =====

Hyperbole is a figure of speech in which the speaker seeks to illustrate the importance of something by providing a greatly exaggerated or unreal statement to describe it. (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]). 

**Reason this is a translation issue** \\ 
If readers understand a statement of hyperbole as if it is literally true, then they will misunderstand the real meaning and believe that the statement is not a true statement, or that it is nonsense. \\ 

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**When the sun was setting, __all__  those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.**  Luke 4:40 \\ Luke wrote that "all" brought their sick ones to Jesus. This is a hyperbole. Probably not everyone did this, but many did. The hyperbole helps to show how excited people were that Jesus could heal them and that a large number of them came to him to be healed.\\ 
\\ 
**When they had brought their boats to land, __they left everything__, and followed him.**  Luke 5:11 \\ Luke wrote that when Jesus invited some fishermen to follow him, they left everything. We know that they left their fishing business. Saying that they left "everything" may be a case of hyperbole to emphasize that now they were completely committed to following Jesus.\\
\\
**If your hand causes you to stumble, __cut it off__. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire"** Mark 9:43a\\
When Jesus said to cut off our hand, he meant that we should do whatever extreme things we need to do in order not to sin. He used this hyperbole to show how extremely important it is to try to stop sinning. Sin weakens our lives from following Jesus, so we must seriously seek to turn from sinning.\\
\\
**If anyone comes to me, and doesn’t __hate__ his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.** Luke 14:26
Because of many other things that Jesus said, we know that his use of the word “hate” here is hyperbole. He meant that we must not love even our own family members more than we love him. Because the Lord Jesus is our God and Savior, we must put him first. Our love for Jesus is the most important love in our lives.
===== Translation Strategies =====

  * Keep the hyperbole if it would not be misunderstood or thought to be a lie.
  * Express the meaning without the hyperbole. For example "all the people" could be translated as "large crowds of people."
  * If you decide to express the meaning without the hyperbole, be sure that it truly is hyperbole. God does miraculous things. Do not assume that something could not have happened just because it seems to be impossible.
