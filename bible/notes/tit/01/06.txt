===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Now every elder must be someone who no one can criticize; he must also have just one wife; his children must trust in God, and people must not consider his children to be wicked or disobedient.
\v 7 Everyone who leads God's people is like someone who manages God's house. So it is necessary for this person to have a good reputation. He should not be proud, he must not get angry quickly, and must not stay angry for any reason. He must not be  an alcoholic, not someone who likes to fight and argue, and not a greedy man.

===== ULB: =====

\v 6 An elder must be without blame, a husband of one wife, with faithful children not categorized as wicked or undisciplined.
\v 7 It is necessary for the overseer, as Godâ€™s house manager, to be blameless, not loud or unrestrained, not wrathful, not addicted to wine, not a brawler, nor a greedy man.
