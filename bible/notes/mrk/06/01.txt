\v 1 And he went out from thence; and he comes into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
\v 2 And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, Whence
has this man these things? and, What is the wisdom that is given to this man, and
what mean such mighty works wrought by his hands?
\v 3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters
here with us? And they were offended in him.
