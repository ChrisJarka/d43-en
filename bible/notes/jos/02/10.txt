You \add Israelites\add* totally destroyed everyone and \add everything in their kingdom\add*.
\v 11 When we heard about those things, we were very dismayed. We no longer have courage to fight against you, because we know that Yahweh, the God \add whom you worship\add*, is helping you. \add And we know that\add* he rules everything up in heaven and here on earth.

\v 10 For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyoud.
\v 11 And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.
