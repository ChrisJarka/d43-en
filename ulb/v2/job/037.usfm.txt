\q
\v 1 Yea, at this my heart trembleth,
\q And is moved out of its place.
\q
\v 2 Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice,
\q And the sound that goes out of his mouth.
\q
\v 3 He sends it forth under the whole heaven,
\q And his lightning to the ends of the earth.
\q
\v 4 After it a voice roareth;
\q He thundereth with the voice of his majesty;
\q And he restraineth not the lightnings when his voice is heard.
\q
\v 5 God thundereth marvelously with his voice;
\q Great things does he, which we cannot comprehend.
\q
\v 6 For he says to the snow, Fall you on the earth;
\q Likewise to the shower of rain,
\q And to the showers of his mighty rain.
\q
\v 7 He sealeth up the hand of every man,
\q That all men whom he has made may know it.
\q
\v 8 Then the beasts go into coverts,
\q And remain in their dens.
\q
\v 9 Out of the chamber of the south comes the storm,
\q And cold out of the north.
\q
\v 10 By the breath of God ice is given;
\q And the breadth of the waters is straitened.
\q
\v 11 Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture;
\q He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:
\q
\v 12 And it is turned round about by his guidance,
\q That they may do whatever he commands them
\q Upon the face of the habitable world,
\q
\v 13 Whether it be for correction, or for his land,
\q Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come.
\b
\q
\v 14 Listen to this, O Job:
\q Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
\q
\v 15 Do you know how God lays his charge upon them,
\q And causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?
\q
\v 16 Do you know the balancings of the clouds,
\q The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
\q
\v 17 How your garments are warm,
\q When the earth is still by reason of the south wind?
\q
\v 18 Canst you with him spread out the sky,
\q Which is strong as a molten mirror?
\q
\v 19 Teach us what we shall say to him;
\q For we cannot set our speech in order by reason of darkness.
\q
\v 20 Shall it be told him that I would speak?
\q Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
\b
\q
\v 21 And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies;
\q But the wind passeth, and cleareth them.
\q
\v 22 Out of the north comes golden splendor:
\q God has upon him terrible majesty.
\q
\v 23 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out:
\q He is excellent in power;
\q And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.
\q
\v 24 Men do therefore fear him:
\q He regards not any that are wise of heart.
