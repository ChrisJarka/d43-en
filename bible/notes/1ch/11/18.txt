\v 18 So the three greatest warriors forced through the camp of Philistia soldiers and drew some water from the well, and brought it to David. But he would not drink it. Instead, he poured it out \add on the ground to be an offering\add* to Yahweh.
\v 19 He said, "Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That would be like \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* drinking the blood of these men who were willing\f + \ft Or: ready \f* to die for me!" So he refused to drink it.
\p That was one of the things that David's three greatest warriors did.

\v 18 So these three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, the well at the gate. They took the water and brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to Yahweh.
\v 19 Then he said, "Yahweh, far be it far from me, that I should drink this. Should I drink the blood of men who have risked their lives?" Because they had put their lives at risk, he refused to drink it. These are things the three mighty men did.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **three mighty men** - "3 mighty men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **broke through the army of the Philistines** - "fought their way through the army of the Philistines"
  * **the well of Bethlehem, the well at the gate** - These two phrases refer to the same well. The second specifies which well in Bethlehem. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:11:15|11:17]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **he poured it out to Yahweh** - This means that he poured out the water as an offering to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Yahweh, far be it far from me, that** - This phrase is an idiom that means that this is something that David would never do because Yahweh has forbidden him to do so. AT: "Yahweh forbid that" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Should I drink the blood of men who have risked their lives?** - David speaks of the water as if it were blood because the men risked their lives to bring the water to him. He uses a question to emphasize this. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I should not drink this water, which would be like drinking the blood of men who have risked their lives to bring it to me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
