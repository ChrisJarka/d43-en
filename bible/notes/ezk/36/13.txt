\v 13 Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because they say to you, You
land are a devourer of men, and have been a bereaver of your nation;
\v 14 therefore you shall devour men no more, neither bereave your nation any more, says the Lord Jehovah;
\v 15 neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations, neither shall you bear the reproach of the peoples any
more, neither shall you cause your nation to stumble any more, says the Lord Jehovah.
