<usfm>
\q
\v 27 I have made you an assayer among my people, so you will know and examine their way.
\q
\v 28 All of them are the most stubborn of people, who walk in slander.
\q All of them are brass and iron: they act corruptly.
\q 
\v 29 The bellows is scorched by their fire; the lead is consumed in their flame.
\q They keep on refining in vain, for the wicked will be torn apart!
\q
\v 30 They will call them “Reject silver!” for Yahweh has rejected them!’”
