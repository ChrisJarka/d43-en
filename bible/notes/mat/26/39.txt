\v 41 You must keep alert and pray so that you can resist when anyone tempts you do sin. You want to do what I tell you, but you are not strong enough to actually do it."

\v 39 He went a little further, fell on his face, and prayed; he said, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
\v 40 He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "What, could you not watch with me for one hour?
\v 41 Watch and pray, that you do not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."

===== Important Terms: =====

  * Father
  * disciples
  * Peter
  * pray
  * temptation
  * spirit

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **fell on his face -**  This is an intentional action and not accidental. (See UDB)
  * **My Father **- This begins a prayer addressed to God the Father.
  * **cup**  - "cup of suffering" (See UDB) The cup represents the sufferings that Jesus had to go through.
  * **What, could you not watch with me for one hour? **- This is a rhetorical question that could be written as a statement as in the UDB. (See: Rhetorical Question)
  * **the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak **- This is a figure of speech that can be understood as in the UDB.  Translation of this verse should not imply that the spirit is always good and the flesh is always bad.
  * **the spirit indeed is willing **- "your intentions are good"
  * **the flesh**  - "your human nature"
