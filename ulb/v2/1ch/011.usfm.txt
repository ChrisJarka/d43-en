\p
\v 1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
\v 2 In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you that led out and brought in Israel: and Jehovah your God said
to thee, You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.
\v 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and
they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of Jehovah by Samuel.
\p
\v 4 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were
there.
\v 5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come in hither. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion;
the same is the city of David.
\v 6 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up
first, and was made chief.
\v 7 And David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.
\v 8 And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
\v 9 And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah of hosts was with him.
\p
\v 10 Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together
with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.
\v 11 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he
lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.
\v 12 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.
\v 13 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground
full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
\v 14 And they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Jehovah saved them by a great
victory.
\p
\v 15 And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the
Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 16 And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.
\v 17 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!
\v 18 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the
gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out to Jehovah,
\v 19 and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in
jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the
three mighty men.
\p
\v 20 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed
them, and had a name among the three.
\v 21 Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: howbeit he attained not to the
first three.
\p
\v 22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two
sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.
\v 23 And he killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s
beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.
\v 24 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.
\v 25 Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the
first three: and David set him over his guard.
\p
\v 26 Also the mighty men of the armies: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,
\v 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
\v 28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
