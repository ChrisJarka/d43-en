\v 22 On the other hand, if I continue to live, that will enable me to continue to serve \add Christ\add* effectively. As a result, I do not know whether I prefer \add to live or to die\add*.

\v 22 But if to live in the fleshwill produce fruit from my work, then I don't know which to choose. 
\v 23 For I am perplexed in choosing between the two. Having the desire to depart and be with Christ is very far better.
\v 24 Yet to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.
