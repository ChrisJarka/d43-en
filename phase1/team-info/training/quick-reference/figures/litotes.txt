====== Litotes ======

===== Description =====

Litotes is a figure of speech in which the speaker expresses a strong positive meaning by using two negative words (See: [[:en:phase1:team-info:training:quick-reference:grammar:double-negatives|Double Negatives]]) or a negative word with a word that means the opposite of the meaning he intends. A few examples of negative words are "no," "not," "none," and "never." The opposite of "good" is "bad." Someone could say that something is "not bad" to mean that it is extremely good.

**Under construction:**
We are only calling something litotes if it also includes irony. However, we have not yet found an easy way to talk about irony in litotes on the tA page or in the notes. So at this point, we will not discuss irony in the notes. (If you can think of a way to do this, please let me know so I can add it to these pages. Susan Q.)
