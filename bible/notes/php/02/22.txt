\v 22 But you know that Timothy has proven his affection for those who love Jesus by the way he serves the believers. He has served with me in the spread of the Good News like a son serves his own father.
\v 23  I confidently expect to send Timothy to you as soon as I know what will happen to me.
\v 24 And because I believe it is the Lord's desire, I am confident that I will soon be released and will be able to travel to see you.
