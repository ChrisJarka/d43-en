====== Hosea 11 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter continues using the poetic form to communicate about Yahweh's relationship to Israel, the Northern Kingdom. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

This is an extended metaphor of Israel as a male child in care of Yahweh, his parent. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

Yahweh uses rhetorical questions to show his disappointment and anger at Israel's persistent rejection of Him.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

In verse 10, Yahweh is portrayed as a lion. This seems opposite to the intent of Yahweh's calling. 
Ephraim and Israel are used to refer to the same people. 

== Yoke ==
The yoke sat in such a way as to make it hard for the animals to chew. So in verse 4, 
"I was to them like someone who eased the yoke on their jaws," is showing how Yahweh was helping His people even in the midst of their rebellion.
