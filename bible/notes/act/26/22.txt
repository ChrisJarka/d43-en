\v 22 However, God has been helping me \add from that time, and he is still helping me\add* today. So I stand here and I tell \add all of you people\add*, those who are important and those who are not, \add who Jesus is\add*. Everything that I say \add about him\add* is what Moses and the \add other\add* prophets wrote \add about long ago, things that they said\add* would happen.
\v 23 They wrote that \add people would cause\add* the Messiah to suffer and die. They also wrote that he would be the first person to become alive again, to proclaim \add the message that would be like\add* light, \add that he would save\add* both \add his own Jewish\add* people and non-Jewish people."

\v 22 However, God has been helping me, so I have continued to proclaim these things to this very day. I have continued to tell both ordinary people and important people exactly what the prophets and Moses said would happen.
\v 23 They said that the Christ would suffer and die, that he would be the first to rise from the dead. They also said that he would proclaim, both to his own people and to the non-Jewish people, that God is truly able to save them."

\v 22 God has helped me until now, so I stand and testify to the common people and to the great ones about nothing more than what the prophets and Moses said would happen;
\v 23 that Christ must suffer, and that he would be the first to be raised from the dead and to proclaim light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.
