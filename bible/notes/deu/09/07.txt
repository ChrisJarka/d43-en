===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Remember and do not forget**  - It would be acceptable to translate only "remember" or "do not forget," since they mean the same. (See: [[:en:ta;vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **you** and **your** - Throughout this passage, the word you and the word your are plural, referring to the entire people of Israel. Beginning with this verse, and for most of the chapter, Moses uses the word you and the word your to mean the generation of Israelites that came before this one. (See: [[:en:ta;vol1:translate:figs_youdual]]) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
