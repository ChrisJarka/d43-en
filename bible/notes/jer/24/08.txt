\v 9 I will \add cause them to experience calamities\f + \ft Or: disasters \f*\add*, with the result that people in every nation on the earth will be horrified, and will hate them because they are evil people.

\v 10 And I will cause them to experience wars and famines and diseases, until they have disappeared from Israel, this land which I gave to them and to their ancestors."

\v 8 But like the bad figs that are too bad to be eaten—this is what Yahweh says—I will act in this way with Zedekiah, king of Judah, with his officials, and with the rest of Jerusalem who remain in this land or go to stay in the land of Egypt.
\v 9 I will turn them into a frightening thing, a disaster, in the sight of all the kingdoms on earth, a disgrace and a subject for proverbs, taunts, and curses in every place where I will have driven them.
\v 10 I will send out sword, famine, and plague against them, until they are destroyed from the land that I gave them and their ancestors."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But like the bad figs that are too bad to be eaten** - This simile speaks of the evil officials in Jerusalem as if they were bad figs that were too rotten to eat. Just as bad figs are useless, so these people who do not follow Yahweh are also useless. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **I will turn them into a frightening thing, a disaster ... a disgrace and a subject for proverbs, taunts, and curses** - These phrases mean the same thing and emphasize how thoroughly Yahweh will judge the people of Jerusalem. They will become something that will frighten other people when they see it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will send out sword, famine, and plague against them** - "I will kill them with war, famine and sicknesses"
  * **I will send out sword** - Here "sword" refers to war or enemy armies. AT: "I will send enemy armies" or "I will send out war" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **sword, famine, and plague** - These things are spoken of as if they were living things that could attach the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **they are finished off from the land** - "none of them remain in the land"
