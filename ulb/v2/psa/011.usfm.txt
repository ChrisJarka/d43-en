\c 11
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 In Jehovah do I take refuge:
\q How say you to my soul,
\q Flee as a bird to your mountain;
\q
\v 2 For, lo, the wicked bend the bow,
\q They make ready their arrow upon the string,
\q That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart;
\q
\v 3 If the foundations be destroyed,
\q What can the righteous do?
\q
\v 4 Jehovah is in his holy temple;
\q Jehovah, his throne is in heaven;
\q His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
\q
\v 5 Jehovah tries the righteous;
\q But the wicked and him that loves violence his soul hateth.
\q
\v 6 Upon the wicked he will rain snares;
\q Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.
\q
\v 7 For Jehovah is righteous; he loves righteousness:
\q The upright shall behold his face.
