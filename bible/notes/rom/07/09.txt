\v 9 Formerly, when I did not \add know\add* what God's laws \add required\add*, I used to live \add without worrying about what I was doing\add*. But when I \add became aware that God\add* commanded, \add "You must not covet\add*," I suddenly realized \f + \ft personification \f* that I was sinning,
\v 10 and \add I realized that\add* I was separated from God. The laws that \add I thought would enable me to\add* live \add eternally as a result of my obeying them\add* caused me \add to realize that\add* I was separated from God!

\v 9 Formerly, when I did not know what God's Law required, I used to sin without worrying about what I was doing. But when I became aware that God had given us his Law, I suddenly realized that I was sinning,
\v 10 and I realized that I was apart from God. The Law that was supposed to allow me to live forever, if I obeyed it, was leading me to die instead.

\v 9 I was alive without the Law once, but when the commandment came, sin regained life and I died.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I was alive without the Law once**  - Before the law there was not conviction of sin. The Law allowed one to recognize he was either obedient or separated from God. Paul is addressing his listeners as to how he lived a life of sin before in order that they might understand the laws purpose. Alternate translation: "I did whatever I wanted before I knew God's Law." (See: Euphemism)
  * **sin regained life and I died** - Here a comparison of life and death. Obedience to Law brings life disobedience leads to death or separation from God. (See:[[en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]] and [[en:ta:translate:personification|Personification]])
  * **The commandment, which was to bring life, I found to be death** - Alternate translation: "The commandment which leads to eternal life showed me how much I was separated from God."
