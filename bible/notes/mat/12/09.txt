\v 9 After Jesus left there that day, he went into a synagogue.
\v 10 There he saw a man with a shriveled hand. The Pharisees kept wanting to debate with Jesus about the Sabbath, so one of them asked him, "Does God permit us to heal people on our day of rest?" They were hoping that Jesus would commit a sin by saying something wrong.

\v 10 Behold, there was a man having a dried up hand. The Pharisees asked Jesus, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they
might accuse him of sinning.
