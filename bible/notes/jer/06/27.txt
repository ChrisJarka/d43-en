<usfm>
\p
\v 27 I have made you a trier and a fortress among my people; that you may know and try their way.
\v 28 They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.
\v 29 The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not
plucked away.
\v 30 Refuse silver shall men call them, because Jehovah has rejected them.
