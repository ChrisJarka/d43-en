\v 8 But they rebelled against me, and were not willing to listen to me. Each man did not throw away the detestable things of his eyes 
and did not forsake the idols of Egypt, so I determined to pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my wrath among them in the midst 
of the land of Egypt.
\v 9 So I acted for my name’s sake so it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations who they were among and I made myself 
known to them, in their eyes, by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
