\p
\v 34 This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet about Elam. This happened at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, and he said,
\v 35 "Yahweh of hosts says this: See, I am about to break the bowmen of Elam, the main part of their power.
\q
\v 36 For I will bring the four winds from the four corners of the heavens,
\q and I will scatter the people of Elam to all of those winds. There is no nation
\q to which those scattered from Elam will not go.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking about what will happen to Elam.

  * **This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah** - This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:14:01|14:1]], and make any changes as needed. AT: "This is the message that Yahweh gave to Jeremiah" or "This is the message that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Yahweh of hosts says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **I am about to break the bowmen of Elam, the main part of their power** - "The archers made Elam very powerful, but I will stop them"
  * **bowmen** - men who are skilled with a bow and arrows
  * **I will bring the four winds from the four corners of the heavens** - Here "four winds from the four corners" is an idiom that represents wind blowing from every direction. AT: "I will cause the winds to blow from every direction" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I will bring the four winds from the four corners of the heavens** - Here "winds" represents nations. And the nations are a synecdoche representing the armies from those nations. Causing armies to come from all directions is spoken of as if Yahweh will cause wind to blow from all directions AT: "I will bring your enemies from every direction to attack you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **to all of those winds** - Here "winds" represents "nations." AT: "to all those nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
