\c 131
\d A Song of Ascents; of David.
\q
\v 1 Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty;
\q Neither do I exercise myself in great matters,
\q Or in things too wonderful for me.
\q
\v 2 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul;
\q Like a weaned child with his mother,
\q Like a weaned child is my soul within me.
\q
\v 3 O Israel, hope in Jehovah
\q From this time forth and for evermore.
