===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus uses a figure of speech about harvesting to tell his disciples how they should respond to the needs of the crowds in the previous section.

  * **pray to the Lord of the harvest**  - That is "pray to the Lord. He is in charge of the harvest." This harvest refers to people who come to faith in God by believing the good news of Jesus. (See: Keyword Harvest)
  * **send out laborers**  - This "laborers" refers to God's workers.
  * **into his harvest **- The harvest is the people who believe and are added to his kingdom. Jesus used farming terms because the people knew about farming. (See: Metaphor)
