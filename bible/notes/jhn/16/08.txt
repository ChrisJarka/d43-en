\v 8 When he comes, he will prove that those who do not belong to God \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add are wrong about what is\add* sinful and about who is really righteous and about whom \add God will\add* judge \add and condemn for their sin\add*.
\v 9 \add He will tell people that their greatest\add* sin is that they do not believe in me.
\v 10 \add He will tell people that\add* because I am going \add back\add* to my Father, and you will no longer see me, \add you will know that I am the one who was truly\add* righteous.
\v 11 \add He will tell people that the fact\add* that \add God\add* has already determined that \add he\add* will punish \add Satan\add*, the one who rules this world, shows that \add some day God\add* will also punish \add those who do not belong to him\add*.

<usfm>
\v 8 When the Helper comes, he will convict them of the sins they have committed; he will show them that they do not measure up to God's standard of goodness; and he promises them judgment and justice before God because they did what God commanded them not to do.
\v 9 Their guilt from sin comes because they could not put their trust in me.
\v 10 Their failure to measure up to God's standard of goodness is confirmed because I am going back to my Father, and you will no longer see me.
\v 11 Their final accounting will come when God brings his punishment against them for their sin. This is shown by the punishment that Satan, the prince of this world will receive, because he fought his war against God.
