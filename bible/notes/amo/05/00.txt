====== Amos 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter continues to be written in a poetic format as Amos is foretelling the demise of the Kingdom of Israel.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

You will notice that this chapter refers to various places in land of Israel (i.e. Gilgal, Bethel, Beersheba). Normally these places have good connotations but here they are referred negatively. This is most likely because these cities had become havens for idol worship. Please review [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]. 

There are a number of mentions of the "city gate". This was a place where people would go for judicial and financial issues. Please review [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]].
