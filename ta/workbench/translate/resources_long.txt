===== translationNotes for Long ULB Phrases =====

==== Description =====
Sometimes there are notes for a phrase and separate notes for portions of that phrase. In that case, the larger phrase is first, and its parts afterward.

The longer phrase is broken down so that translation suggestions for parts of the phrase can be explained for each part.

==== Translation Notes Examples ====

> But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart that you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath (Romans 2:5 ULB)

  * **But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart** - Paul compares a person who refuses to listen and obey God to something hard, like a stone. The heart represents the whole person. AT: "It is because you refuse to listen and repent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **hardness and unrepentant heart** - The phrase "unrepentant heart" explains the word "hardness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
In this example the translation suggestion first explains about the Figures of Speech and then explains about the Doublet in the same passage.
