===== Definition: =====

A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill.

  * This agreement can be between individuals, between groups of people, or between God and people.
  * When people make a covenant with each other, they say that they will do something, and they must do it.
  * Examples of covenants include marriage covenants, business agreements, and treaties between countries.
  * Throughout the Bible, God made several different covenants with his people.
  * In some of the covenants, God promised to fulfill his part without conditions.
  * In other covenants, God promised to fulfill his part only if the people obeyed him and fulfilled their part of the covenant.
  * Ways to translate this term could include the concepts of a binding or formal agreement, contract or promise.
