\v 20 So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound
of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the
city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
\v 21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass,
with the edge of the sword.
