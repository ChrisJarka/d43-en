\v 12 After he finished washing our feet, he put his cloak back on. Then he sat down and said to us, "Do you understand what I have done for you?
\v 13 You \add show that you respect me by\add* calling me 'Teacher' and 'Lord'. You are right to say that, because I am your teacher and your Lord.
\v 14 But if I, who am your teacher and your Lord, have washed your feet, you ought to \add serve each other by doing things like\add* washing each other's feet.
\v 15 I have made myself an example for you in order that you should \add humbly serve each other\add* as I have done for you.

\v 14 But if I, your teacher and Lord, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.

\v 12 So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said to them, Know you what I have done
to you?
\v 13 You call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and you say well; for so I am.
\v 14 If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one anotherâ€™s feet.
