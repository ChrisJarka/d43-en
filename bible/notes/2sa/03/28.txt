\v 28 And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner
the son of Ner:
\v 29 let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his fatherâ€™s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one
that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falls by the sword, or that lacketh bread.
\v 30 So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
