\v 1 You asked about the ministry for the people that God set apart for himself. But I do not need to write to you about this.
\v 2 I already know your desire to help, and I praised you to the people of Macedonia. In fact, I have been told that the people of Achaia have been preparing for this collection since last year. Your enthusiasm is an example that has moved them to take action.
