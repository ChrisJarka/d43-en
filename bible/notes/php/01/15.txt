\v 15 Some people are proclaiming the Good News because they are jealous and they want believers to honor them rather than me. But others are proclaiming the Good News because they love Christ and they want people who have not heard the Good News to hear it.
\v 16 Those who proclaim the Good News because they love Christ know that God appointed me to speak in public and explain why the Good News is true.
\v 17 But those who are proclaiming the Good News about Christ for selfish reasons do not have good reasons for doing so. They believe they are causing me more suffering while I am here in prison.

\v 15 Some indeed even proclaim Christ out of envy and strife, and others also out of good will.
\v 16 The ones who proclaim Christ out of love know that I have ben assigned to defend the gospel.
\v 17 But the others proclaim Christ out of selfish and insincere motives. They think they are adding to the affliction I suffer in my imprisonment.
