===== Writing Styles - Quotations =====

===== Description =====

When saying that someone said something, we often tell who spoke, who they spoke to, and what they said.
The information about who spoke and who they spoke to is called the quote margin. What the person said is the quote. In some languages the quote margin may come first, last, or even in between to parts of the quote. The quote margins are underlined below.
  * __She said__, "The food is ready. Come and eat."
  * "The food is ready. Come and eat," __she said__
  * "The food is ready," __she said.__ "Come and eat."

When writing that someone said something, the quote (what was said) is put quotation marks called inverted commas. ("_") 

**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages normally put the quote margin before the quote, while others normally put it after the quote. Some languages can put it in either place, and some can put it in between two parts of a quote.  Translators need to figure out what is most clear and natural in their language.  


===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Quote margin before the quote:**
  * **But __his mother answered and said__, "No, instead he will be called John."** (Luke 1:60)
  * **__Zechariah said to the angel__, "How will I know this will happen? For I am an old man, and my wife also is very old."**  (Luke 1:18)
  * **Then some tax collectors also came to be baptized, and __they said to him__, "Teacher, what must we do?"** Luke 3:12)
  * __He to them,__ "Do not collect more money than you are supposed to." (Luke 3:13)

**Quote margin after the quote:**
  * **Yahweh relented concerning this. "It will not happen," __he said__.**  (Amos 7:3) 

**Quote margin between to parts of the quote:**
  * **"For look, days are coming"—__this is Yahweh’s declaration__—"when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel"**  (Jeremiah 30:3)

  * **“I will hide my face from them," __he said,__ "and I will see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children who are unfaithful."**  Deuteronomy 32:20)

  * **"Therefore, those who can,” __he said,__ "should go there with us. If there is something wrong with the man, you should accuse him.”**  Acts 25:5 

===== Translation Strategies =====
  - Observe how and where people in your language group place the quote margin and what verbs they use.
  - Make sure you follow that system in your translation.

  * **But his mother answered and said, "No, instead he will be called John.**:(Luke 1:60)

  * 
  * **“For look, days are coming”—this is Yahweh’s declaration—“when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel”** (Jeremiah 30:3)
