===== Translation Notes: =====
Samuel continues to rebuke the nation of Israel.

    * **No! Instead, a king must reign over us**  - "We want a king to rule us" (UDB) This shows their strong reaction against Samuel when he told them about trusting God because God delivered them in the past.
    * **although Yahweh, your God, was your king**  - "even though Yahweh was already your king" (UDB) Samuel is telling them that they have settled for less than what Yahweh wanted to do for them.  (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **whom you have chosen, whom you have asked for** - (See:[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
