====== Dietary Customs ======


===== Definition: =====


In the culture of the Old Testament, there were only two meals a day morning and evening. The people had a midday rest and after this they did a number of important activities. It was during the midday rest that:


    * Abraham sat in the door of his tent for a rest. Genesis 18:1
    * Ish-Bosheth stayed in his house 2 Samuel 4:5.


The women prepared the evening meal on a fire for the men when they returned from work.


The meal normally consisted of vegetables or a lentil stew (Genesis 5:29 & 34; Daniel 1:12) and was dished out of the common pot with a piece of bread. Jesus identified his betrayer (Judas Iscariot) in Mark 14:20 by saying that the “one who dips with me in the bowl.” John 13:25-26 says Jesus gave a sop to Judas Iscariot. (The Israelites were given a list of animals that could be eaten. (Leviticus 11)


A blessing was said by Samuel when eating with Saul prior to the eating (1 Samuel 9:13) In Deuteronomy 8:10 the command was given that after you have eaten and were satisfied to bless the LORD your God for the good land provided the substance. This blessing was given after the meal.


Jesus and the disciples reclined at the table to eat (Luke 7:36-50). The word "table" could also mean a mat which was spread on the ground or floor. Or it could be a very low table in which it was customary to recline on one's left side and eat with the right hand.


===== How to Translate =====


Every culture has food so a general word for "eating" should be used to mean "consume." There are multiple references to "eating the scripture."
