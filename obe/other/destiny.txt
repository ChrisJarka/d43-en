The term "destiny" refers to what will happen to people in the future. If someone is "destined" to do something, it means that what that person will do in the future has been decided by God.

  * When God "destines" a nation for wrath, this means that he has decided to punish that nation because of their sin.
  * Judas was "destined" for destruction, which means that God had decided that Judas would be destroyed because of his rebellion.

  * Every person has a final, eternal destiny, either in heaven or in hell.
  * John the Baptist was "destined" to preach about the kingdom of God which would cause people to either reject God or to repent and turn back to God. God had determined that John would do that.

  * I will destine you for wrath, destine them fro the sword their destiny is destruction, same destiny for everyone this is the destiny of the wicked man, you hold onto my destiny, the destiny of all the nations that forget God
