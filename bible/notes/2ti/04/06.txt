===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 \add Timothy, I say these things to\add* you because as for me, \add it is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add they are now about to kill me. It is as though my blood will\add* be poured out \f + \ft Or:they will kill me \f* \add as a sacrifice on the altar\add*; that is, \add I know\add* that it is the time for me to die \f + \ft euphemism \f*.
\v 7 \add And as to telling people the\add* good \add message and defending it\add*, I have exerted myself thoroughly\f + \ft Or: done it with all my energy \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like a boxer does. As to doing\add* the work that God gave me to do, I have completed it, \add like a runner who finishes\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the race. \add As to\add* what we believe, I have been loyal to it\f + \ft Or: continue to believe it \f*.
\v 8 \add So, like people award\add* a prize \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add to the winner of a race\add*, the Lord, who judges rightly, will give me a reward \add because I have lived\add* righteously. He will give me that reward when \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add he judges people\add*. And not only \add will he reward\add* me, but he will also reward all those who very much want him to come back.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I tell you these things, because soon I will die and leave this world. I will be like the cup of wine that they pour out on the altar and sacrifice to God.
\v 7 I have done my best to do everything that God has commanded me to do. I am like a soldier who has fought his best. I am like a runner who has finished the race.
\v 8 Now a prize is waiting for me because I have lived in the right way for God. The Lord will judge me in the right way. He will give that prize to me when he comes again. And he will give it also to everyone who waits eagerly for him to come again.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 For I am already being poured out as an offering. The time of my departure has come.
\v 7 I have fought the good fight; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith.
\v 8 There remains in wait for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have come to love his appearing.
