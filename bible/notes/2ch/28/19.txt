\v 19 For Jehovah brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed sore
against Jehovah.
\v 20 And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
\v 21 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave
it to the king of Assyria: but it helped him not.
