  * **Again it came about**  - See how you translated a similar phrase in 01:6.
  * **sons of God **- or "angels" (UDB).
  * **on the day when**  - This is not a specific day.  This gathering  happened often. Alternate translation: "at the time when" or "one day when".
  * **present themselves before Yahweh **- See how you translated this in 01:6.
  * **From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it**  - These two clauses mean basically the same thing. "To and fro" as well as "back and forth" are used together to mean everywhere. Alternate translation: "I have been everywhere upon the earth." (See: Parallelism and Merism).
