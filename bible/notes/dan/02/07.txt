\v 7 They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
\v 8 The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that you would gain time, because you see the thing is gone from me.
\v 9 But if you make not known to me the dream, there is but one law for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to
speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me the interpretation
thereof.
