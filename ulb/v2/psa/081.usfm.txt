\c 81
\d For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 Sing aloud to God our strength:
\q Make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.
\q
\v 2 Raise a song, and bring hither the timbrel,
\q The pleasant harp with the psaltery.
\q
\v 3 Blow the trumpet at the new moon,
\q At the full moon, on our feast-day.
\q
\v 4 For it is a statute for Israel,
\q An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
\q
\v 5 He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony,
\q When he went out over the land of Egypt,
\q Where I heard a language that I knew not.
\q
\v 6 I removed his shoulder from the burden:
\q His hands were freed from the basket.
\q
\v 7 You calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee;
\q I answered you in the secret place of thunder;
\q I proved you at the waters of Meribah. \qs [Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify to thee:
\q O Israel, if you would listen to me!
\q
\v 9 There shall no strange god be in thee;
\q Neither shall you worship any foreign god.
\q
\v 10 I am Jehovah your God,
\q Who brought you up out of the land of Egypt:
\q Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
\q
\v 11 But my people listened not to my voice;
\q And Israel would none of me.
\q
\v 12 So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart,
\q That they might walk in their own counsels.
\q
\v 13 Oh that my people would listen to me,
\q That Israel would walk in my ways!
\q
\v 14 I would soon subdue their enemies,
\q And turn my hand against their adversaries.
\q
\v 15 The haters of Jehovah should submit themselves to him:
\q But their time should endure for ever.
\q
\v 16 He would feed them also with the finest of the wheat;
\q And with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.
