\v 31 Listen carefully! There will soon be a time when I will cause all the strong \add young men\add* in your family to die. The result will be that no men in your family will \add live long enough to\add* become old men.
\v 32 You will be distressed and envious as you see the blessings that I will give to the \add other people in\add* Israel. And \add I repeat that\add* no men in your family will ever live long enough to become old men.
\v 33 There is one of your descendants whom I will spare, and not prevent him from serving me as a priest. But he will become blind, and then he will always be sad and grieving. But all your other descendants will die violently.

\v 31 Behold, the days are coming, that I will cut off your strength, and the strength of your fatherâ€™s house, so there will not be an old
man in your house.
\v 32  You will see the distress of my dwelling, in spite of all the wealth which God will give Israel; and there will not be an old man in your house forever.
\v 33  The man of yours, whom I will not cut off from my altar, will be to consume your eyes, and to sadden your heart; and all the increase of your house will die in the prime of life.
