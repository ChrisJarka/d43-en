\v 27 For, "He put everything in subjection under his feet." But when it says "everything has been put in subjection," it is clear that this does not include the one who put everything in subjection to himself.
\v 28 When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to the one who subjected everything to him, that God may be all in all.
