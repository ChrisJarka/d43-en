\v 17 Israel is a sheep scattered and driven away by lions. First the king of Assyria devoured him;
\q then after this, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon broke his bones.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh speaks to Jeremiah about Israel.

  * **Israel is a sheep scattered and driven away by lions** - Yahweh speaks of Israel as if it were a sheep that was trying to escape from hungry lions. This metaphor can be stated as a simile and in active form. AT: "Israel is like a sheep that lions scattered and drove away"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Israel** - This refers collectively to all the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the king of Assyria** - This refers to the army of the king of Assyria. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **devoured him** - The destruction of Israel by Assyria is spoken of as if Israel were a sheep that Assyria ate. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon** - This refers to the army of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **broke his bones** - The destruction of Israel by Nebuchadnezzar is spoken of if it were a sheep which had its bones crushed by a lion. AT: "destroyed Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh of hosts ... says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **See, I am about to** - The word "See" means to pay special attention to what follows.
  * **and his land** - Here "land" is a metonym for the people who live in the land of Babylon. AT: "and the Babylonian people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
