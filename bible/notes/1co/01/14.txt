\v 14 I thank God that I baptized only a few people there, among them was I baptized Crispus and Gaius.
\v 15 It would not be true that  I baptized them in my name.
\v 16 (Now I remember that I also baptized the household of Stephanas, but other than those people, I do not remember baptizing anyone else in Corinth.)
