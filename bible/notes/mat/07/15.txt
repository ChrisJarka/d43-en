\v 15 Watch out for people who come to you and say falsely that they are telling you what God has said. They seem to be harmless, but that is not true. They are like wolves that have covered themselves with sheepskins. They want people to believe that they are harmless sheep, but they will actually attack you like wolves.
\v 16 So how will you know that they are false? Well, by seeing the fruit that plants produce, you know what kind of plants they are. For example, thornbushes cannot
produce grapes, so no one even thinks of picking grapes from thornbushes. And thistles cannot produce figs, so no one thinks of picking figs from thistles.
\v 17 Here is another example: all good fruit trees produce good fruit, but all rotten trees produce worthless fruit.

\v 15 Beware of false prophets, those who come to you in sheepâ€™s clothing, but are truly ravenous wolves.
\v 16 By their fruits you will know them. Do people gather grapes from thornplants, or figs from thistles?
\v 17 In the same way, every good tree brings forth good fruit, but the ruined tree brings forth bad fruit.
