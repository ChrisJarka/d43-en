\v 5 Ashkelon will see and be afraid! Gaza also will tremble greatly! Ekron, her hope will be confounded!
The king will perish from Gaza and Ashkelon shall no longer be inhabited!
\v 6 A a bastard will dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
\v 7 For I will remove his blood from his mouth and his abominations from between his teeth, then he will become a
remnant for our God like a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
