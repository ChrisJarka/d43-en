\v 44 On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them, the portions require by the law for the priests and for the Levites, according to the fields of the towns, for Judah rejoiced over the priests and for the Levites who were standing before them.
\v 45 They performed the service of their God, and the service of purification, according to the commandment of David and of Solomon his son, and so did the singers and the gatekeepers.
