==== Description ====

Exclamations express strong feeling. In the ULB and UDB, they usually have an exclamation mark (!) at the end.

>Save us, Lord; we are about to die! (Matthew 8:25 ULB)

**Reason this is a translation issue**: Languages have different ways of showing that a sentence is used to show strong emotion.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

Some exclamations have a word that shows feeling. The sentences below have "Oh" and "Ah.".

>__Oh__, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

>Gideon understood that this was the angel of Yahweh. Gideon said, "__Ah__, Lord Yahweh! For I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face!" (Judges 6:22 ULB)

Some exclamations start with a question word such as "how" or "why," but they are not used for asking a question.

>How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

Some exclamations in the Bible do not have a main verb.

>You worthless person! (Matthew 5:22 ULB)
