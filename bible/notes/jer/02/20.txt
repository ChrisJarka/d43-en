===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Long ago, you stopped obeying me \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and you would not allow me to lead you \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 you refused to worship me.
\q1 Instead, you worship idols that are under trees on the top of every hill,
\q2 and your young women have sex with \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add men at those places\add*.
\q1
\v 21 \add It is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* you were a grapevine that I planted
\q2 when it was a cutting from a very good vine.
\q1 So now it is disgusting that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* you have become like a rotten worthless vine.
\q1
\v 22 Your guilt from your sins is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* very bad stains on a cloth,
\q2 and you cannot get rid of those stains even by using very strong soap.
\q1 \add This is true because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.

<usfm>
\p
\v 20 For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you saidst, I will not serve; for upon every high hill
and under every green tree you did bow thyself, playing the harlot.
\v 21 Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate branches of a
foreign vine to me?
\v 22 For tough you wash you with lye, and take you much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, says the Lord
Jehovah.
