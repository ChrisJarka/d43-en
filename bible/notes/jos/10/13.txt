The sun stopped while it was in the middle of the sky, and did not set\f + \ft Or: go down \f* for about a whole day.
\v 14 On that day Yahweh did a great miracle that someone asked him to do. There was never a day like that previously, and there has never been a day like that since. Yahweh was certainly fighting for the Israelite people!
