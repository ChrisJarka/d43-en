====== Timothy ======

===== Facts: =====

Timothy was a young man from Lystra who became a believer in Christ as a result of Paul's ministry in his town. He later joined Paul on several missionary trips and helped shepherd new communities of believers.

  * Timothy's father was a Greek, but both his grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice were Jews and believers in Christ.
  * The elders and Paul formally appointed Timothy for the ministry by placing their hands on him and praying for him.
  * Two books in the New Testament (I Timothy and 2 Timothy) are letters written by Paul, providing guidance to Timothy as a young leader of local churches.
