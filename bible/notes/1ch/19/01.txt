\v 1 And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
\v 2 And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And Davidâ€™s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to
comfort him.
\v 3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest you that David does honor your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? are not his servants come to you to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
