====== Jeremiah ======


===== Facts: =====

Jeremiah was a prophet of God in the kingdom of Judah.

  * Like most of the prophets, Jeremiah often had to warn the people that God was going to punish them for their sins.
  * Jeremiah prophesied that the Babylonians would capture Jerusalem, which made some of the people of Judah angry. So they put him in a dry well and left him there to die. But the king of Judah ordered his servants to rescue Jeremiah from the well.
