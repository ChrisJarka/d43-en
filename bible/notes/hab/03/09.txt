<usfm>
\q
\v 9 You have brought out your bow without a cover;
\q oaths were sworn against the tribes! \qs [Selah.\qs*
\q You cleaved the earth with rivers.
[[Contra the UBS guidebook, I think it best not to completely reinterpret the Hebrew. The uncovered bow (ie. Prepared for use) should be noted in the UDB or in Commentary perhaps. The oaths connect with the bow since the inevitable consequence of sin is destruction. Perhaps the oaths of Dt. 28 are in mind?]]
\q
\v 10 The mountains saw you and anguished!
\q Downpours of water passed over them;
\q the deep set its voice on high!
\q It lifted up its hands!  [[Most translations
put “on high” with the lifting of the hands, but this seems to me to be a reference to Flood imagery. The deeps are speaking from on high, ie. The mountain tops. The lifting up of hands is a demonstration of power. This explains how the waters’ triumphant acts contrast with the mountains trembling.]]
