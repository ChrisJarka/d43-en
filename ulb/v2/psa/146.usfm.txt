\c 146
\q
\v 1 Praise you Jehovah.
\q Praise Jehovah, O my soul.
\q
\v 2 While I live will I praise Jehovah:
\q I will sing praises to my God while I have any being.
\q
\v 3 Put not your trust in princes,
\q Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
\q
\v 4 His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth;
\q In that very day his thoughts perish.
\q
\v 5 Happy is he that has the God of Jacob for his help,
\q Whose hope is in Jehovah his God:
\q
\v 6 Who made heaven and earth,
\q The sea, and all that in them is;
\q Who keeps truth for ever;
\q
\v 7 Who executes justice for the oppressed;
\q Who gives food to the hungry.
\q Jehovah looseth the prisoners;
\q
\v 8 Jehovah opens the eyes of the blind;
\q Jehovah raises up them that are bowed down;
\q Jehovah loves the righteous;
\q
\v 9 Jehovah preserves the sojourners;
\q He upholdeth the fatherless and widow;
\q But the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
\q
\v 10 Jehovah will reign for ever,
\q Your God, O Zion, to all generations.
\q Praise you Jehovah.
