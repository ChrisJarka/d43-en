===== translationNotes: =====

  * **rule in your hearts** - Paul speaks of the peace of Christ as if it were a ruler. Paul means that we are to allow Christ to rule in our hearts, and when he does so, he will bring peace. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in your hearts** - It was normal for Paul to speak of the heart as if it were the place where people feel most intensely certain conditions such as peacefulness. Translators should use the most natural expression in the project language for feeling at peace. (See: [[:en:obe:other:heart]] and  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Let the word of Christ live in you** - Paul speaks of Christ's word as if it were a person capable of living inside other people. This expression may be regarded as representing the idea that believers should always trust Christ's promises (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **admonish one another** - "caution and encourage one another"
  * **with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs** - "with all sorts of songs to praise God"
  * **thankfulness in your hearts** - "thankful hearts"
  * **in word or in deed** - speaking or acting.
  * **in the name of the Lord Jesus** - to honor the Lord Jesus, with the authority of the Lord Jesus (See: [[:en:obe:kt:name]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **through him** - Here the words "through him" stand for the reason the believers are to thank God the Father through the Lord Jesus. (See: [[::en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
