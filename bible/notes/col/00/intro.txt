=== What is the Book of Colossians about? ===

Paul was concerned by some false teaching in the church at Colossae.  He spent much of the letter writing about it.  There may have been a group of Jewish Christians who were trying to force the other Christians to follow the Jewish laws from the Old Testament, especially circumcision.  Paul writes specifically that Christians need nothing or no-one else except Christ in order to be accepted by God (1:15-20) and that teachings based on human reasoning are useless (2:8).

=== Who wrote the Book of Colossians? ===

The letter to the Colossians was written by the Apostle Paul (1:1).  He wrote the letter while he was in prison, probably in Rome, around 60 years after the birth of Christ.  Colossians, together with Ephesians and Philemon, are called the prison letters since Paul wrote them while he was in prison.  He wrote this letter to the church in the city of Colossae.  Paul did not start the church in Colossae, as he mentions in 2:1, but must have felt some responsibility for it.  Itâ€™s possible that Epaphras founded the church since he was from Colossae.
