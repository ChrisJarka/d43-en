\v 14 And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said to him, Are you the man of God that came from Judah? And he said, I am.
\v 15 Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
\v 16 And he said, I may not return with you, nor go in with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place:
