\v 9 "It will come in that day
\q —this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh—
\q that I will make the sun set at noon,

\q
\v 10 I will turn your festivals into mourning
\q and all your songs into lamentation.
\q I will make all of you wear sackcloth
\q and have baldness on every head.

\q and a bitter day to its end.
