\v 21 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great
gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day,
singing with loud instruments to Jehovah.
\v 22 And Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites that had good understanding
in the service of Jehovah. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of
peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
