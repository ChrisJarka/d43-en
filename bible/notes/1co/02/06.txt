\v 6 I do teach a message that people who are  \add spiritually\add* mature  \add consider to\add* be wise. But I do not teach a message that unbelievers  \add consider to be\add* wise. I also do not teach a message that unbelieving rulers in the world consider to be wise. \add What they think about it does not matter\add*, because  \add some day\add* they will lose their power\f + \ft Or: not be ruling anymore \f*.
\v 7 Instead, I teach about what God planned wisely  \add long ago\add*. It is something that people did not know about previously because  \add God\add* did not reveal it previously. But God determined before he created the world that he would greatly benefit us by his wise plan.

\v 6 However, we do speak wisdom among the mature, not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.
\v 7 But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, The wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory.
