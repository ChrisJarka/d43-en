\p
\v 9 Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, you that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the
prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be
built.
\v 10 For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out
or came in, because of the adversary: for I set all men every one against his neighbor.
