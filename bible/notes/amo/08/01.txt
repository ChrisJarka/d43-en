\p
\v 1 This is what the Lord Yahweh showed me. Look, a basket of summer fruit!
\v 2 He said, "What do you see, Amos?" I said, "A basket of summer fruit." Then Yahweh said to me,
\q "The end has come for my people Israel;
\q I will spare them no longer.
\q
\v 3 The songs of the temple will become wailings in that day
\q —this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh—
\q many dead bodies, they are thrown everywhere!
\q Silence!"
