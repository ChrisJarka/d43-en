===== Description =====


  * Example(s)  (from the Bible, or short ones we make up--not from English literature)


**Reason this is a translation issue:** If quotes are not marked well in a translation, it can be hard for the readers to know who is saying what. \\

**Translation Principles  (optional)**

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**ULB Text.** (Book c:v ) Don't indent or bullet this. Use two forward slashes at the end so that the explanation will show up on the next line.\\ 
Explanation of how this is an example.  (Don't indent or bullet this.)

   
===== Translation Strategies =====
If (an) x would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it/one. If not, here [are other options / is another option] \\ 


I'm banging down ideas. They are not worded well.
  - Use double quotes for the first quotation. Use single quotes for the quotation in it. Use double quotes for a quotation in that one. 
  - Translate an embedded quote as an indirect quote.
  - If a quote is very long and has many quotes within it, do not use quote marks on the main quote. Instead mark it off by indenting it, and use the quote marks only for the quotes within it.
