==== God is one being existing as 3 Persons: Father, Son, Spirit ====

1. **The Bible is clear. There is only one God.**\\ 
"Yahweh, he is God; there is __no other God__!" [[:en/bible/notes/1ki/08/59|I Kings 8:60]]\\ 
"Jesus said,... This is everlasting life: that they should know you, __the only true God__." [[:en/bible/notes/jhn/17/03|John 17:3]] (See [[:en/bible/notes/deu/04/35|Deut. 4:35,]] [[:en/bible/notes/deu/06/04|6:4;]] [[:en/bible/notes/eph/04/04|Eph. 4:5-6]]; [[:en/bible/notes/1ti/02/05|1 Tim. 2:5]]; [[:en/bible/notes/jas/02/18|James 2:19]])

2. **The Old Testament indicates a plurality in God, God's Persons.**\\ 
"__God__ created the heavens… __The Spirit of God__ was moving… 'Let __us__ make man in __our__ image.' " [[:en/bible/notes/gen/01/01|Gen. 1:1-2,]] [[:en/bible/notes/gen/01/26|26]] "about the __Son__ he says, "Your throne, __God__, is forever... __God__, __your God__..." [[:en/bible/notes/heb/01/08|Heb. 1:8-9]] quoting [[:en/bible/notes/psa/045/005|Psalm 45:6-7]]

3. **The Church has always found it impossible to state what the New Testament says about God without affirming that He exists in three distinct Persons: The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.**\\
"Jesus said, '...Baptize them into the name of __the Father__, of __the Son__, and of __the Holy Spirit__.' " [[:en/bible/notes/mat/28/18|Matthew 28:19]]
"God sent his __Son__, born of a woman,... God sent the __Spirit__ of his Son into our hearts, who calls, 'Abba, __Father__.' " [[en/bible/notes/gal/04/03|Galatians 4:4]][[:en/bible/notes/gal/04/06|-6]] (See also: [[:en/bible/notes/jhn/14/15|John 14:16-17;]] [[:en/bible/notes/1pe/01/01|1 Peter 1:2]])\\
Each Person of God is fully God, but also distinct. All three Persons can appear separately at the same time.
"After he was baptized, __Jesus__ came up... from the water... He saw the __Spirit__ of God coming down..., and a __voice__ [the Father's] came out... saying, 'This is my Beloved __Son__...' " [[:en/bible/notes/mat/03/16|Matthew 3:16-17]]


==== Reasons the words 'Father' and 'Son' must be translated literally ====

1. **The names Father and Son are chosen by God himself and revealed in the Bible, the word of God.**
Jesus said, "I praise you __Father__, Lord of heaven and earth,... no one knows the __Son__ except the __Father__, and no one knows the __Father__ except the __Son__..." [[:en/bible/notes/mat/11/25|Matthew 11:25-27]] (See also [[:en/ulb/ep/44-jhn.usfm|John 6:26-57]])\\
The terms 'Father' and 'Son' have been found by theologians to be irreplaceable, because any other terms end up suggesting incorrect things about God. No one should try to replace them in translation.

2. **The words "Father" and "Son" show God's Persons exist in an __eternal__, infinite, loving relationship.**  
"__The Father loves the Son__." [[:en/bible/notes/jhn/03/34|John 3:35-36,]] [[:en/bible/notes/jhn/05/19|5:19-20]] Jesus said, "__Father__, __glorify your Son__ so that t__he Son may glorify you__... I glorified you on the earth,... Now Father, glorify me along with your own self with the glory that __I had with you before the world was created__." [[:en/bible/notes/jhn/17/01|John 17:1]][[en/bible/notes/jhn/17/03|-5]]\\
Father, Son, and Spirit have eternally loved one another. Human fathers and sons should love as God loves.

3. **The eternal Son humbled himself 2000 years ago. Jesus' mother was Mary, but his father was God.**
"Then Mary said, 'How will this happen, since I am a virgin?' The angel answered her, 'The __Holy Spirit__ will come over you and the power of the __Most High__ will overshadow you. Therefore, the holy one who will be born will be called the __Son of God__.' " [[:en/bible/notes/luk/01/34|Luke 1:34-35]]\\ 
"__Christ Jesus__... did not consider his __equality with God__ as something to hold on to. But instead he emptied himself... in the likeness of men he humbled himself... to the death of the cross." [[:en/bible/notes/php/02/05|Philippians 2:5-8]]\\  
Christ is termed "son of the Most High" because the Holy Spirit miraculously placed him in Mary's womb, introducing his temporal mission to be born as a human and provide salvation for humanity.

4. **God the Father adopts believers in Christ as his 'sons'.** [[en/bible/notes/gal/04/03|Galatians 4:4]][[:en/bible/notes/gal/04/06|-6]]\\
"God so loved the world, that he gave __his only unique Son__, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. God did not send the __Son__... to condemn the world, but so that the world should be saved... He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been condemned already because he has not believed __in the name of the unique Son of God__." John 3:16-18\\
"God... sent his own __Son__... to be an offering for sin, and he condemned sin in the flesh." Romans 8:3
"... we were reconciled to God through the death of his __Son__,... saved by his life." Romans 5:10
