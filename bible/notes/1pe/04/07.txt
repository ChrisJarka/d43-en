\v 7 All things on this earth will soon come to an end. Therefore, keep thinking sensibly, and control what you think so that you can pray well.
\v 8 Most importantly of all, love each other sincerely, because if we love others we will not try to find out what they have done wrong.
\v 9 Provide food and a place to sleep for those Christian travelers who come among you, and do it without complaining.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The end of all things is coming** - This refers to the end of the world at Christ's second coming.
  * **be of sound mind, and be sober in your thinking** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Peter uses them to emphasize the need to think clearly about life since the end of the world is near. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **be sober in your thinking** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1pe:01:13|1:13]].
  * **Above all things** - "Most importantly of all" (UDB)
  * **for love does not seek to discover the sins of others** - Peter describes "love" as if it were a person. AT: "for a person who loves others will not make an effort to find out if another person has sinned" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **hospitality** - showing kindness to and welcoming guests and travelers
