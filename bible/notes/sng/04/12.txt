===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The man continues to praise the woman.

  * **My sister** - This is an idiom of affection. They are not actually brother and sister. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:04:09|4:9]]. AT: "My dear" or "My darling" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my bride** - This Hebrew word can refer to a woman who is married or to one whom a man has arranged to become his son's wife. If your language has a polite word that a man would use to his wife and that has not been used yet in this book, you could use it here. Otherwise you could use any polite term a man would use with his wife. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:04:09|4:9]].
  * **is a garden locked up** - "is a garden that no one can enter." The garden is a metaphor for the woman, and the lock is a metaphor for her still being a virgin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **a spring that is sealed** - "a spring with a cover on it." The spring or well is a metaphor for the woman, and the cover is a metaphor for her being a virgin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Your branches** - branches or channels of rivers, a clear euphemism for the female body part. If any reference to this would be offensive, translate it as a synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "You" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **a grove** - a place where many trees grow together
