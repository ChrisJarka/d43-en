\v 15 Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory: where are your zeal and your mighty
acts? the yearning of your heart and your compassions are restrained toward me.
\v 16 For you are our Father, tough Abraham knows us not, and Israel does not acknowledge us: you, O Jehovah, are our
Father; our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.
