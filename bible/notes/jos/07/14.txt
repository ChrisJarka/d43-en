<usfm>
\v 14 Tomorrow morning you must present yourselves before Yahweh, tribe by tribe. Then Yahweh will indicate to which tribe \add the man who took those things belongs\add*. Then Yahweh will indicate to which clan from that tribe \add the guilty man belongs\add*. Then Yahweh will indicate to which family he belongs. And then he will indicate which person \add in that family took them\add*.
\v 15 Then the one who has taken some of the things that should have been destroyed will be destroyed in a fire. And everything he owns will be destroyed with him, because he has disobeyed the command that Yahweh gave us and has done something that is disgraceful to us Israelite people.'~"

\v 14 In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah takes
shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near by households; and the household which
Jehovah shall take shall come near man by man.
\v 15 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath; because
he has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he has wrought folly in Israel.
