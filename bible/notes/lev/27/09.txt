\v 9 If someone solemnly promises to give an animal that is acceptable to be an offering to me, that animal becomes sacred \add and belongs to me\add*.
\v 10 The person who promised to give it must not give another animal instead of the one that he promised; he must not substitute a bad one for a good one or even a better one than the one offered. If he would substitute one for the other, both animals would belong to me.

\v 9 If it is an animal which someone wants to sacrifice to Yahweh, everything which any man gives of such an offering to Yahweh will be holy.
\v 10 He must not alter or change it, a good one for a bad one or a bad for a good. If he does at all change animal for animal, then both it and the one for which it is exchanged become holy.
