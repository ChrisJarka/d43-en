\c 75
\d For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a song.
\q
\v 1 We give thanks to thee, O God;
\q We give thanks, for your name is near:
\q Men tell of your wondrous works.
\q
\v 2 When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly.
\q
\v 3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved:
\q I have set up the pillars of it. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 I said to the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly;
\q And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
\q
\v 5 Lift not up your horn on high;
\q Speak not with a stiff neck.
\q
\v 6 For neither from the east, nor from the west,
\q Nor yet from the south, comes lifting up.
\q
\v 7 But God is the judge:
\q He puts down one, and lifts up another.
\q
\v 8 For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth;
\q It is full of mixture, and he pours out of the same:
\q Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.
\q
\v 9 But I will declare for ever,
\q I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
\q
\v 10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off;
\q But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
