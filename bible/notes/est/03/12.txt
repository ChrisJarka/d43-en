\v 12 Then the king’s scribes were called together on the thirteenth day of the first month. On that day, an order was written, according to everything Haman commanded, and it was sent out to the king’s provincial governors (those who were over all the provinces), and to the governors of all the various peoples in the kingdom, and to the officials of all the people. The order was written in every language and in the script of those languages so they could be read and understood.It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and was sealed with the king’s ring, which Haman kept.
\v 13 The documents with the orders were hand-delivered by couriers in every province in the kingdom. The order was to kill every Jew, to kill them all, and to destroy the Jewish people, from young to old, children and women, and to do this all in one day—on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (which is the month of Adar)—and when they are dead, to go through all their valuables, and those who killed them should take them as their own.
