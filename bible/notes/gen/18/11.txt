===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **will I have this pleasure**  - You may want to add "of having a baby" (UDB). Sarah used this rhetorical question because she did not believe that she could have a child. This means "I will never experience the joy of having a child." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **my lord being old also**  - This means "since my husband is also old."
  * **my lord**  - This is a title of respect that Sarah gave to her husband Abraham.
