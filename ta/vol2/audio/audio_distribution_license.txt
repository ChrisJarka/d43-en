===== License =====

//This page answers the question:// //What does the license determine for distribution?//

Distribution options depend significantly on the terms of the content license.

==== Open-licensed (CC BY-SA, Public Domain) ====
If you recorded and produced open-licensed content, you are free to make the best decisions possible for making your audio content available and accessible to people in the ways that work best for them.

==== Restricted-license (Copyright All Rights Reserved) ====
If you recorded and produced restricted-license content (requires expressed permission of the content owner), you are bound by the distribution requirements and limitations set forth in the contract or agreement. Some, or much, of what is discussed in this section may not be legally possible for you and may lead to frustration, extra costs and missed opportunities. It is true that at no point in a project are the constraints of All Rights Reserved copyright so evident as when you reach the finish and want to share it with others.

We do not encourage dishonesty in keeping terms of restrictive agreements you may have entered into, as much as you might feel you would be helping God's Kingdom. This could be in the form of breaking the legal terms yourself or intentionally look the other way while allowing a third party to distribute out of compliance with the terms. Such actions are clearly illegal and, beside the ethical implications of doing things that way in ministry, there are potential ramifications for recipients of restricted content. In some countries, breaking copyright law is a criminal offense. Action against the recipient of copyright restricted material can be pursued by the government without request or consent of the copyright holder.

Is this the way that God's family must go about ministry? Would it not be much better for God's family to work together in a way that did not require our brothers and sisters to break the law or be dishonest in agreements with one another? This is not a problem created by the laws of governments. Instead this is a problem created by choosing a license that legally restricts and controls access to Biblical content. This is something that occurs unnecessarily within God's global family. Governments are only enforcing the license terms that were chosen. Rather than break the law or encourage others to do so, consider being part the solution that avoids all of this and actually allows us all to bless others with God's message in their heart language without all the restrictions and ramifications mentioned above.
