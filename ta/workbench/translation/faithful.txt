====== Creating Faithful Translations ======

==== Faithful Translations ====

To create a **FAITHFUL** translation of the Bible means that the translator identifies the translationWords and the unknown ideas in the text that are ambiguous or difficult to understand, and translates these parts consistently and faithfully.

   * Identify the translationWords of the original text. Translate these words or phrases consistently and faithfully for the both the Bible stories and Bible.
  * Look for unknown ideas in the places that are ambiguous or difficult to understand. Then, use the unfoldingWord biblical resources to see the helps that others suggest for translation.

=== translationWords ===

To translate translationWords, follow these four steps:

  - Study the meaning of the original word.
  - Compare the word with other words of similar meaning.
  - Think of possible ways to translate the term. Choose one to try.
  - Test the term you have chosen to see if others understand the meaning.

The goal of accurate translations is to translate the meaning of the original message clearly, accurately and naturally, keeping the author’s main focus in mind.

**Remember**: translationWords should be translated consistently.

=== Unknown Ideas ===

Sometimes a thing or custom is unknown in the target language. Possible solutions are to use a descriptive phrase, substitute something similar, use a foreign word from another language, use a more general word or use more specific words. See the lesson on __[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|

 ]]__ for more information.

One kind of ‘unknown idea’ are words that refer to Jewish and Christian religious customs and beliefs. Some common unknown ideas are:

**Names of places**  Such as

  * Temple (a building where the Israelites offered sacrifices to God)
  * Synagogue (a building where Jewish people assemble to worship God)
  * Sacrificial alter (a raised structure on which sacrifices were burned as gifts, or offerings, to God.)

**Titles of people who hold an office**  Such as

  * Priest (someone who is chosen to relate to God on behalf of his people)
  * Pharisee (important group of Israel’s religious leaders in Jesus’ time)
  * Prophet (person who speaks God’s messages to people)
  * Son of Man
  * Son of God
  * King (ruler of an independent city, state or country).

**Key Biblical Concepts**  Such as

  * Forgiveness (to not resent that person and not be angry at him for doing something hurtful)
  * Salvation (being saved or rescued from evil, enemies, or from danger)
  * Redemption (the act of buying back something that was previously owned or that was held captive)
  * Mercy (helping people who are in need)
  * Grace (help or regard that is given to someone who has not earned it).

Use terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Terms addressing the relationship between God the Father and God the Son should be retained in translated content and clarified, if needed.
