\c 102
\d A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and pours out his complaint before Jehovah.
\q
\v 1 Hear my prayer, O Jehovah,
\q And let my cry come to thee.
\q
\v 2 Hide not your face from me in the day of my distress:
\q Incline your ear to me;
\q In the day when I call answer me speedily.
\q
\v 3 For my days consume away like smoke,
\q And my bones are burned as a firebrand.
\q
\v 4 My heart is struck like grass, and withered;
\q For I forget to eat my bread.
\q
\v 5 By reason of the voice of my groaning
\q My bones cleave to my flesh.
\q
\v 6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness;
\q I am become as an owl of the waste places.
\q
\v 7 I watch, and am become like a sparrow
\q That is alone upon the house-top.
\q
\v 8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day;
\q They that are mad against me do curse by me.
\q
\v 9 For I have eaten ashes like bread,
\q And mingled my drink with weeping,
\q
\v 10 Because of your indignation and your wrath:
\q For you have taken me up, and cast me away.
\q
\v 11 My days are like a shadow that declineth;
\q And I am withered like grass.
\b
\q
\v 12 But thou, O Jehovah, will abide for ever;
\q And your memorial name to all generations.
\q
\v 13 You will arise, and have mercy upon Zion;
\q For it is time to have pity upon her,
\q Yea, the set time is come.
\q
\v 14 For your servants take pleasure in her stones,
\q And have pity upon her dust.
\q
\v 15 So the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah,
\q And all the kings of the earth your glory.
\q
\v 16 For Jehovah has built up Zion;
\q He has appeared in his glory.
\q
\v 17 He has regarded the prayer of the destitute,
\q And has not despised their prayer.
\q
\v 18 This shall be written for the generation to come;
\q And a people which shall be created shall praise Jehovah.
\q
\v 19 For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary;
\q From heaven did Jehovah behold the earth;
\q
\v 20 To hear the sighing of the prisoner;
\q To loose those that are appointed to death;
\q
\v 21 That men may declare the name of Jehovah in Zion,
\q And his praise in Jerusalem;
\q
\v 22 When the peoples are gathered together,
\q And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.
\b
\q
\v 23 He weakened my strength in the way;
\q He shortened my days.
\q
\v 24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:
\q Your years are throughout all generations.
\q
\v 25 Of old did you lay the foundation of the earth;
\q And the heavens are the work of your hands.
\q
\v 26 They shall perish, but you shall endure;
\q Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment;
\q As a vesture shall you change them, and they shall be changed:
\q
\v 27 But you are the same,
\q And your years shall have no end.
\q
\v 28 The children of your servants shall continue,
\q And their seed shall be established before thee.
