===== Description =====

Poetry is one of various way in which to use words to make it more beautiful and shows the feeling. It is used to express a stronger emotional feeling than simple non-poetic forms would express.


**Some things commonly found in poetry**\\ 
  - Lots of figures of speech particularly metaphors, similes  and metonymys.   (See: Metaphor [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], and]]) Example of metaphor:  Example of simile (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]: You cover yourself with light as with a garment; you spread out the heavens like a tent curtain. (Psalm104:2) Example off metonymy (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]): to the sound of joy and celebration, the voices of the groom and bride (Jeremiah 16:9)
  - 	Parallel lines (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) Example: 
For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant planting;  
  -	Repetition of some or all of a line. Example: Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his angel armies. Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars. (Psalm 148:2&3)
  -	An idea and the negative of that idea. Example: My son, do not forget my commands, and keep my teachings in your heart
  -	Speaking of objects or even abstract ideas as if they were living creatures (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) Example: The roads of Zion mourn (Lamentation 1:4a) or \v 20 Wisdom cries aloud in the street, (Proverbs 1:20a)
