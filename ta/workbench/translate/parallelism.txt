====== Parallelism ======

**Parallelism ** is a poetic device in which one idea is expressed in two or more different ways. Parallelism is a prominent feature of Biblical Hebrew poetry most commonly found in the books of Psalms and Proverbs, but also throughout the whole of the Bible.

Note: We are using the term __parallelism__ for long phrases or clauses that are similar in grammatical structure or idea and are used together. We are using the term __doublets__ for words or short phrases that mean basically the same thing and are used together. [If this is true, then the examples on the doublets page need to be changed.]

Parallelism in poetry has several effects:

  * It shows that something is very important by saying it more than once and in more than one way.
  * It makes the language more beautiful and above the ordinary way of speaking.
  * It makes the poem more memorable and easier to sing.
  * It helps the hearer to think more deeply about the idea by saying it in different ways.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Translate both clauses just as they are.
  * If people misunderstand the parallelism and think that the different clauses are talking about different things, then you may combine the ideas of both clauses into one clause or use one of the ideas below.
  * If it appears that the two clauses are used together to show that what they say is really true, you could include words that emphasize the truth such as "truly" or "certainly."
  * If it appears that the two clauses are used together to intensify an idea in them, you could use words like "very," "completely" or "all."

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.**  Psalms 119:105 \\ This can be written as: Your word is a lamp to my feet and your word is a light for my path. \\ Both 'lamp' and 'light' are parallel because they mean the same thing. The words 'my feet' and 'my path' also mean the same thing.
