\v 11 Then said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so shall your servant do. As
for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king’s sons.
\v 12 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to
Mephibosheth.
\v 13 So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king’s table. And he was lame in both his feet.
