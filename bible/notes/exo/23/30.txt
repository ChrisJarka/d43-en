\v 31 I will cause the borders of your land to extend from the Red Sea in the southeast to the Mediterranean Sea in the northwest, and from the Wilderness of Sinai in the southwest to the Euphrates River in the northeast of the country.

\v 32 You must not make any agreement with those people or with their gods.
\v 33 Do not allow those people to live in your land in order that they do not cause you to sin against me. If you worship their gods, you will not be able to escape from worshipping them and sinning against me just as someone caught in a trap is unable to escape."

\v 30 Little by little I will drive them out from before you until you become fruitful and inherit the land.
\v 31 I will fix your border from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River. I will give you victory over the inhabitants of the land. You will drive them out before you.
\v 32 You must not make a covenant with them nor with their gods.
\v 33 They must not live in your land so that they do not make you sin against me.  If you worship their gods, it will surely be a trap to you.
