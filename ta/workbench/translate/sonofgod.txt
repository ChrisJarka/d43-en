==== God is one being existing as 3 Persons: Father, Son, Spirit ====

1. **The Bible is clear. There is only one God.**\\ 
"Yahweh, he is God; there is __no other God__!" [[:en/bible/notes/1ki/08/59|I Kings 8:60]]\\ 
"Jesus said,... This is everlasting life: that they should know you, __the only true God__." [[:en/bible/notes/jhn/17/03|John 17:3]] (See [[:en/bible/notes/deu/04/35|Deut. 4:35,]] [[:en/bible/notes/deu/06/04|6:4;]] [[:en/bible/notes/eph/04/04|Eph. 4:5-6]]; [[:en/bible/notes/1ti/02/05|1 Tim. 2:5]]; [[:en/bible/notes/jas/02/18|James 2:19]])

2. **The Old Testament indicates a plurality in God, God's Persons.**\\ 
"__God__ created the heavens… __The Spirit of God__ was moving… 'Let __us__ make man in __our__ image.' " [[:en/bible/notes/gen/01/01|Gen. 1:1-2,]] [[:en/bible/notes/gen/01/26|26]] "about the __Son__ he says, "Your throne, __God__, is forever... __God__, __your God__..." [[:en/bible/notes/heb/01/08|Heb. 1:8-9]] quoting [[:en/bible/notes/psa/045/005|Psalm 45:6-7]]

3. **The Church has always found it impossible to state what the New Testament says about God without affirming that He exists in three distinct Persons: The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.**\\
"Jesus said, '...Baptize them into the name of __the Father__, of __the Son__, and of __the Holy Spirit__.' " [[:en/bible/notes/mat/28/18|Matthew 28:19]]
"God sent his __Son__, born of a woman,... God sent the __Spirit__ of his Son into our hearts, who calls, 'Abba, __Father__.' " [[en/bible/notes/gal/04/03|Galatians 4:4]][[:en/bible/notes/gal/04/06|-6]] (See also: [[:en/bible/notes/jhn/14/15|John 14:16-17;]] [[:en/bible/notes/1pe/01/01|1 Peter 1:2]])\\
Each Person of God is fully God, but also distinct. All three Persons can appear separately at the same time.
"After he was baptized, __Jesus__ came up... from the water... He saw the __Spirit__ of God coming down..., and a __voice__ [the Father's] came out... saying, 'This is my Beloved __Son__...' " [[:en/bible/notes/mat/03/16|Matthew 3:16-17]]


==== Reasons the words Father and Son must be translated as literally as possible ====

1. **The names Father and Son are chosen by God himself and revealed in the Bible, the word of God.**
Jesus said, "I praise you __Father__, Lord of heaven and earth,... no one knows the __Son__ except the __Father__, and no one knows the __Father__ except the __Son__..." [[:en/bible/notes/mat/11/25|Matthew 11:25-27]] (See also [[:en/ulb/ep/44-jhn.usfm|John 6:26-57]])\\
The terms 'Father' and 'Son' have been found by theologians to be irreplaceable, because any other terms end up suggesting incorrect things about God. No one should try to replace them in translation.

2. **"Father" and "Son" show that God's Persons exist in an __eternal__, infinite, loving relationship.**  
"__The Father loves the Son__." John 3:35-36, 5:19-20 Jesus said, "Father, glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you... I glorified you on the earth,... Now Father, glorify me along with your own self with the glory that I had with you before the world was created." John 17:1-5\\
Father, Son, and Spirit have eternally loved one another, so human fathers and sons are to love as God loves.
