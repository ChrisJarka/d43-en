\v 33 He has now done that for us who are their descendants, and also for you who are not Jews, by causing Jesus to live again. That is just like what David wrote in the second Psalm that God said when he was sending his Son,
\q 'You are my Son;

<usfm>
\v 32 So we are bringing you good news about the promises made to our forefathers:
\v 33 God has kept these promises to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus from the dead. This is also what was written in the second psalm:
    
    \q 'You are my Son, today I have become your Father.'
    
\v 34 Also about the fact that he raised him up from the dead so that his body will not decay, he has spoken like this: 
    
    \q 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'
