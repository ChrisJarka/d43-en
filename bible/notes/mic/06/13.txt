===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 Therefore I have struck you with a severe wound,
\q I have made you a ruin because of your sins.
\q
\v 14 You will eat but not be satisfied;
\q your emptiness will remain inside you.
\q You will store goods away but not save,
\q and what you do save I will give to the sword.
\f + \ft Parts of this verse are difficult to understand, because there are two Hebrew words in it whose meanings are not known. As a result, various other readings have been proposed that some modern versions follow. \f*
\q
\v 15 You will sow but not reap;
\q you will tread the olives but not anoint yourselves with oil;
\q you will press grapes but drink no wine.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I have struck you with a severe wound** - Yahweh giving his people wounds is a metaphor for him punishing them. AT: "I have punished you severely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **your emptiness will remain inside you** - A person or thing being hungry is spoken of as if it were something that could be put in a container, and the people are spoken of as if they were containers. AT: "You will be hungry, and you will not be able to eat enough to satisfy yourself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
