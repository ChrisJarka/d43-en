\v 32 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keep covenant and lovingkindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that has come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.
\v 33 Howbeit you are just in all that is come upon us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;
\v 34 neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies wherewith you did testify against them.
