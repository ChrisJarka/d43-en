====== 1 Corinthians 15:29-30 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 \add Now think about this: Some among you\add* are being baptized \f + \ft Or: are baptizing people \f* on behalf of those who died \add before someone baptized them\add* \f + \ft Or: who died \add before they became believers\add* \f*. If, \add as some people say, believers\add* will not be raised \add from the dead\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will not cause \add believers\add* to become alive again \f*, what is the value in those people doing that?\f + \ft Or: there is no value in those people doing that! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* If \add God\add* will not cause any \add believers\add* to become alive again, it is senseless to be baptized \f + \ft Or:baptize anyone \f* on behalf of someone who has died.\f + \ft Or: why would someone be baptized ( Or:baptize anyone ) on behalf of someone who has died? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 30 Furthermore, \add if God will not cause us believers to become alive again\add*, it is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* very foolish for me and the other apostles to be constantly \add putting ourselves\add* in danger \add because we tell people God's good message\add*!

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 29 If there is no resurrecton (using a human example), what purpose would it serve for those who in our day "baptize for the dead," if there were no resurrection?
\v 30 And if our proclamation of the resurrection were untrue, (again measuring through our own experience), why are we in danger every hour, if there is no resurrection from the dead, why do they want to silence us?

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 29 Or else what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?
\v 30 And why are we in danger every hour?
