===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Therefore Yahweh will raise up against him, Rezin, his adversary** - The meaning of this phrase is not clear.  The southern kingdom of Judah had successfully sought the help of Assyria in defeating Rezin, King of Syria.  However, Assyria then destroyed the northern kingdom of Israel and threatened to destroy the Judah.  Before the Assyrians succeeded in doing this, the Babylonians arrived and took the people into captivity.  The references to "him" and "his" are also unclear. Alternate translation: "Because the people of Israel have sinned, the Lord will punish them by bringing the Assyrians, King Rezin's enemies, to destroy them." (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:ambiguity]])
  * **and will stir up his enemies, the Arameans on the east, and the Philistines on the west** - The word "his" refers to Israel.  Alternate translation: "The Assyrians will stir up Israel's enemies, the Arameans to the east and the Philistines to the west."  (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]]) 
  * **They will devour Israel with open mouth** - Isaiah compares Israel's enemies to wild beasts who will tear apart and eat the people of Israel.  The name of a kingdom or nation is a metonym for the people of that kingdom or nation. Alternate translation: "Like wild beasts, Israel's enemies will devour the people of Israel" (See:  [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metaphor]] and [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metonymy]]).
  * **his hand will still be stretched out to strike** - The word "his" refers to Yahweh.  Here "hand" is a metonym for Yahweh. Alternate translation: "the Lord will stretch out his hand and strike his people."    (See [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metonymy]] and [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:personification]])
