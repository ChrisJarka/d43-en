====== 1 Corinthians 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Paul begins to answer a series of questions, which may have been asked of him. The first question involves marriage. The second question is on changing ones status: a slave trying to become free, a Gentile becoming a Jew or a Jew becoming a Gentile. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Divorce ==
Christians should try not divorce. [[:en:obe:kt:believe|Believers]] married to unbelievers should not leave their husband or wife. If the unbelieving husband or wife leaves, this is not considered to be [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]]. Paul advises that, because of the difficult times and the nearness to the return of Jesus, remaining unmarried is an acceptable option.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Euphemisms ==
There are many [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism|euphemisms]] used to describe sexual relations because this is often a taboo topic and many cultures do not wish to speak about openly about these matters.
