====== How to Make a First Draft Translation ======

  - As you translate, be sure that you read and use the Translation Notes for each passage that you translate.
  - As you translate, be sure that you read and understand the definitions of Important Terms for each highlighted word in the passages that you translate.

[Part of this drafting process can bring in issues of orthography and spelling decisions, and formatting issues such as section headings, footnotes, verse numbering, proper names, direct quotes and OT quotations, etc.]
