===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Therefore, get rid of all sinful desires related to this world, as if they are enemies that must be killed. Do not seek to do sexually immoral or impure acts. Do not carry out lustful or evil thoughts. And do not act with greed. These things are like worshipping idols instead of the true God, because God is set apart from such sinfulness.
\v 6 Because of such sin the anger of God comes upon those who disobey him.
\v 7 You yourselves also formerly lived like that when you were participating with those who indulge in such ways of living.
\v 8 So now get rid of all these sinful ways, as if you were putting them to death. Do not angrily rage at others or scheme to cause trouble. Do not let evil or filthy or blasphemous words be spoken from out of your mouths, and

\v 5 Put to death, therefore, your sinful desires of earth--fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry.
\v 6 The wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience because of these things,
\v 7 and in these things you also once walked when you lived by them.
\v 8 Now also get rid of all these--wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy, and shameful speech from your mouth.
