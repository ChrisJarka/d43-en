=== Structure and formatting ===

**Gift to the Church in Jerusalem**

Chapters 8 and 9 are a new section dealing with the gift from the churches in Greece to the poor believers in Jerusalem.

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 8:15, which are a quotation from the Old Testament.
