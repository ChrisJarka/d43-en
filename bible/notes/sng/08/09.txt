===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **If she is a wall...silver, **
 - If the young girl has strength of character and does not invite strangers to take advantage of her, the family  (brothers) will talk about her beauty and give her ornaments to wear to be attractive.
  * **If she is a door,...cedar.**
 - If the young girl tries to attract men other than the man she is promised to, the family (brothers) will cover the door (her outgoing, friendly personality) with cedar (closed up inside the house). This will keep her from unwanted attention.
