\v 11 For he will come and strike the land of Egyptâ€”who is given to death will be given to death, who is given to captivity will be taken captive, and who is given to the sword will be given to the sword!
\v 12 Then I will kindle a fire against the houses of the gods of Egypt and he will burn them and capture them, and wrap the land of Egypt just as the shepherd wraps his clothes, and go out from that place in peace.
\v 13 And he will break the memorials of the house of Shemesh which is in the land of Egypt, and he will burn the houses of the gods of Egypt with fire!
