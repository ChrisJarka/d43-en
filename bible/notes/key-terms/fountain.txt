====== fountain, spring ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, both "fountain" and "spring" are translations of a word that refers to water that comes up naturally from the ground or some other flowing water source.

  * This word is also used figuratively in the Bible to refer to a source of blessings from God.
  * In present-day English, a fountain is usually a manmade object that has water flowing out of it such as a drinking fountain, so it may be better to use a word or phrase that only refers to a natural source of flowing water.
