==== Description ====

An extended metaphor is one that is used in more than a sentence. It might be used in a paragraph or in several lines of poetry. 

 
=== Reasons this is a translation issue  ===
  * People may not realize that the images represent other things.
  * People may not be familiar with the things that are used as images. 

=== Translation Principles  ===
  * Make the meaning of a metaphor as clear to the target audience as it was to the original audience.
  * Do not make the meaning of a metaphor more clear to the target audience than it was to the original audience.
  * When someone uses an extended metaphor, the images are an important part of what he is trying to say.
  * You may need to find some way of translating the images so that people can understand them.

==== Examples from the Bible ====



Psalm 23 has the extended metaphor of a shepherd representing God and sheep representing God's people. Shepherds give sheep what they need, take them to safe places, rescue them, guide them, and protect them. These are things that God does for his people.

><sup>1</sup>Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing.
><sup>2</sup>He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
>he leads me beside tranquil water.
><sup>3</sup>He brings back my life;
>he guides me along right paths for his name's sake.
><sup>4</sup>Even though I walk through a valley of darkest shadow,
>I will not fear harm since you are with me;
>your rod and your staff comfort me. (Psalm 23:1-4

Isaiah 5 has a metaphor with a farmer representing God and a vineyard representing his people.  Just as a farmer works hard and plants a vineyard and cares for it, God 

><sup>1</sup>...My well beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
><sup>2</sup>He spaded it and removed the stones, and planted it with the choicest vine.
>He built a tower in the middle of it, and also built a winepress.
>He waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced wild grapes. 

><sup>3</sup>So now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah;
>judge between me and my vineyard.
><sup>4</sup>What more could have been done for my vineyard, that I have not done for it?
>When I looked for it to produce grapes, why did it produce wild grapes?
><sup>5</sup> Now I will inform you what I will do to my vineyard; I will remove the hedge;
>I will turn it into a pasture; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled on.
><sup>6</sup>I will lay it waste, and it will not be pruned nor hoed. But briers and thorns will spring up,
> I will also command the clouds not to rain on it.

><sup>7</sup>For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel,
>and the men of Judah his pleasant planting;
>he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing;
>for righteousness, but, instead, a cry for help. (Isaiah 5:1-2 ULB)

==== Translation Strategies ====
If people would understand the metaphor in the same way that the original readers would have understood it, consider using it. If not, here are some other strategies.

  - If the target audience would think that the images should be understood literally, change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding "like" or "as."
  - If the target audience would not know the **image,** find a way of translating it so they can understand what it is.
<del>  - If the target audience would not know the **image**, see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] for ideas on how to translate that image.
  - If the target audience would not use that **image** for that meaning use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times.</del>
