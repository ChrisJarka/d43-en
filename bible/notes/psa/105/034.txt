===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **so many locusts** - "there were so many locusts"
  * **The locusts ate up all of the vegetation...They ate up all the crops** - These two phrase mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the locusts completely destroyed the crops."The locusts completely devoured all of the crops" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He killed every firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their strength** - "first fruits" describes"firstborn.""He killed every firstborn in their land, which were the first fruits of all their strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
