\v 12 One day, Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Climb to the top of the Abarim mountains \add east of the Jordan River\add*. Then look out over the land that I am giving to the Israelite people.
\v 13 After you have seen it, you will die \f + \ft euphemism \f* just like your \add older\add* brother Aaron did.
\v 14 The reason \add that you will die and not enter that land\add* is that you both disobeyed my instructions\f + \ft Or: commands \f* in the Zin Desert. When the Israelite people rebelled against me there at Meribah, near Kadesh, \add I told you to speak to the rock to cause\add* water to flow out of it. \add But because you struck the rock instead of speaking to it\add*, you did not show the people my holy power."

\v 12 And Jehovah said to Moses, Get you up into this mountain of Abarim, and behold the land which I have given to the children of Israel.
\v 13 And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered;
\v 14 because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
