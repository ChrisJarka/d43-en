<usfm> \v 17 He said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing? Do you think that it is not important that these men of Judah are doing these detestable things here? But they are doing other terrible things. They are acting violently throughout their country, and continually provoking my anger. Look at them!

<usfm> \v 17 God said to me, "Do you see this, Son of man? Is it a little thing for the house of Judah to do these abominations that they are doing here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger, holding up branches to their noses. \v 18 So I will also act among them; my eye will not have compassion, and I will not spare them. Though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them!" </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Is it a little thing for the house of Judah to do these abominations that they are doing here**  - In this phrase the words "little thing" refer to something that isn't important or does not matter.  God uses this question to show Ezekiel how serious it is that the people are worshiping idols. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:rhetorical-question]])
  * **filled the land with violence**  - This means that violence is happening in every part of the country.  The word "violence refers to people hurting and killing others.
  * **provoke me to anger**  - "make angry" or "cause me to be angry"
  * **holding up branches to their noses**  - Translate this as it is written.  It is unsure what custom this refers to but some believe it refers to a part of worshiping false gods where people would offer tree branches to the sun by holding them up with both hands in front of their face.
  * **spare**  - keep them from punishment
  * **Though they cry in my ears with a loud voice**  - The phrase "cry in my ears" refers to the worried prayers of the people of Israel.  The word "cry" refers to saying something loudly or yelling.  Here God speaks of having ears even though the Bible teaches God is Spirit (See: [[en:bible:notes:jhn:04:23|John 4:23]]) without a body.  An invisible God.  (See: [[en:bible:notes:col:01:15|Colossians 1:15]])  Alternate translation: "Though they yell their prayers in a loud voice" (See:[[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:personification]])
