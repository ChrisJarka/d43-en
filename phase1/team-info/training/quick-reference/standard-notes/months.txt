====== Months ======

===== Explanation: =====

We have an Important Terms page for biblical months. It explains solar and lunar calendars and give the approximate length of a month. In the translation notes we need to provide information that will help translators relate biblical months to their own months and season. This may include:

  - 1) Providing the equivalent months on western calendars
  - 2) Providing seasonal and agricultural information if it is relevant to the context

===== Standard Notes: =====

  * **Abib/Nissan** - This is the first month of the Hebrew calendar and marks when God brought the people of Israel out of Egypt. It is at the beginning of the spring season when the late rains come and people begin to harvest their crops. March and April
