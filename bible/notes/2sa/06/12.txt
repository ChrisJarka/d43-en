\v 12 Now it was told to king David, saying, "The Lord has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him,
because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with
joy.
\v 13 And when those who bore the ark of the Lord had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.
