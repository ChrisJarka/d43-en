====== Rhetorical Question ======

A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. An answer is not expected for rhetorical questions.  A rhetorical question may be used to express deep emotion or to encourage the reader to think deeply on a topic.  Other times, the question may <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>indicate the speaker’s attitude toward the topic or the listener. At times, rhetorical questions are used for sarcasm, rebuking or scolding.  Some languages have other purposes as well.</font>

===== Examples from English =====

**Could you do this for me?** \\
Someone could say this if they want to politely tell someone to do something.

**What possessed you to think of doing that?** \\
A mother might scold her child by saying this.

**Do you expect me to believe that?** \\
Someone might say this when he believes that what another person has said could not possibly be true.

**Do you see this tree here?** \\
A person could say this to draw someone's attention to a tree.

**Do fish swim?** \\
Someone might say this in order to indicate that the answer to a previous question is obviously yes.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.”** Luke 1:18 (WEB)\\
When Zechariah asked this rhetorical question, he was indicating that he could not believe that what the angel said was true.

**All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of the Lord was with him.** Luke 1:66 (WEB)\\
The people were not expecting anyone to answer their question. They were simply expressing that they wondered about it because they were impressed by the surprising things they had heard about his birth.

**He said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”** Luke 2:49 (WEB)\\
Jesus did not expect an answer to these rhetorical questions. He was expressing his surprise that they did not know where to find him. He may have also been mildly rebuking them for not knowing that he needed to be in the temple.

**He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"** Luke 3:7 (WEB)\\
With this question John was rebuking the people harshly for going to him to him to be baptized in order to escape God's punishment when they had no desire to stop sinning.

**For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Isn’t it even you, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?** 1 Thes 2:19 (WEB)\\
Paul used the first rhetorical question to help the Thessalonians focus on the fact that they were the ones. Then to emphasize that even more, he answered his rhetorical question with another rhetorical question, "Isn't it you?"

===== Translation Suggestions =====

1. Determine the purpose of the rhetorical question.\\
2. If your language would use a rhetorical question for that purpose, then use it.\\
3. Languages may have different forms of rhetorical questions for different purposes. For example, if a parent wants to scold his child for writing on the walls, some languages could do it in different ways: "Why are writing on the wall?" or "Who told you to write on the wall?" or "Is that __your__ wall that you're writing on?"\\
4. If your language would use a statement or a command for that purpose, then use a statement or command. For example, if your language would not say "Do you see this tree here?" in order to draw people's attention to it, you might translate that question as a command, "Look at this tree here."
