====== watch, watchman ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "watch" means to look at something or someone intentionally and carefully. A "watch" is also the name for a shift or unit of time (3 to 4 hours) during which a watchman for a city in biblical times would be on the alert looking out for any threat from an enemy.

  * Figurative meanings of "watch" also include the idea of being careful and giving close attention to something. For example:
      * To "watch your life and doctrine closely" means to be careful to live wisely and avoid false teachings.
      * To "watch out" is a warning to be careful to avoid a danger or harmful influence.
      * To "keep watch" means to always be alert and on guard against something.
  * For the purpose of appointing watchmen to guard a city, the 12-hour period at night was divided into equal time periods called "watches." <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>In New Testament times, the Jews followed the Roman system and had four watches of three hours each.</font>
  * Based on this, the "first watch" would be from sunset to around 9:00 pm, the "second watch" would be from 9:00 pm to midnight, the "third watch" would be from midnight to around 3:00 am and the "fourth watch" would be from 3:00 to 6:00 am.
  * When the exact time is not known, references to time could be translated with general phrases such as, "late afternoon" or "early morning" or "the middle of the night" or "mid-morning."
