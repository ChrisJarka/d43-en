\q
\v 9 Where your fathers rebelled by testing me,
\q And  they saw my works for forty years.
\q
\v 10 Therefore I was displeased with this generation,
\q And said, 'They do always go astray in their hearts,
\q and they did not know my ways.
\q
\v 11 As I swore in my anger,
\q They will not enter into my rest.' "
