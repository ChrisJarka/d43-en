\v 21 And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the River, that whatever Ezra
the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence,
\v 22 to a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred
baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
\v 23 Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should
there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
