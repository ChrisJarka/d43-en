<usfm>
\v 51 He said that, not because he thought of it himself. Instead, since he was the high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the whole \add Jewish\add* nation.
\v 52 But he was also prophesying that Jesus would die, not just for the Jews, but for all the people living in other lands who \add would belong\add* to God, in order that he would unite \add all of them into\add* one \add group\add*.
\v 53 So from that day the \add Jewish leaders\add* started to make plans how they could kill Jesus.

\v 51 He said that, not because he thought of it himself. Instead, since he was the high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the  nation.
\v 52 But he was also prophesying that Jesus would die, not just for the Jewish nation only, but also so he could gather into one nation, from all the children of God, those who live in other lands everywhere.
\v 53 So from that day forward the Council sought every way to put Jesus to death.

\v 51 Now this he said not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;
\v 52 and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered
abroad.
\v 53 So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.
