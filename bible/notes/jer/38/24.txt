\v 24 Then Zedekiah said to me, "Do not tell anyone what you told me; if you tell anyone, the king's officials may kill you.
\v 25 If my officials find out that I talked to you, perhaps they will come to you and say, 'Tell us what you and the king were talking about. If you do not tell us, we will kill you.'
\v 26 If that happens, just tell them that you pleaded with me not to send you back to the dungeon\f + \ft Or: cell \f* in Jonathan's house, \add because you were afraid that\add* you would die \add if you were put there again\add*."

\v 24 Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die.
\v 25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come to thee, and say to thee, Declare to us now
what you have said to the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said to you:
\v 26 then you shall say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to
Jonathanâ€™s house, to die there.
