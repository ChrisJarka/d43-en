====== Melchizedek ======

â€‹

===== Facts: =====

Melchizedek was the king of Salem (pre-Israelite Jerusalem about 2000 B.C.) and a priest called by "God Most High."

  * This king and priest blessed Abram after Abram's victory over an alliance of powerful kings, and served him bread and wine.
  * Abram gave Melchizedek a tithe of one-tenth of the booty from this victory.
  * In Hebrews 7, Melchizedek is said to have greater status than Abram because the tithe is paid from the person with the lower status to the person with the higher, and so the blessing is from Melchizedek, the person with the higher status to Abram with the lower status.
  * Today, the amount of the tithe at one-tenth comes from this event.
  * Melchizedek is mentioned in Genesis 14, Psalm 110, and in Hebrews 5 - 7.
  * A main theme of the book of Hebrews is to show that Jesus Christ has a higher status than Melchizedek or any Levitical priest.
