===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh gives a new message to Ezekiel.

  * ** Then it happened** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **in the twelfth month of the twelfth year** - It was implied that Ezekiel is counting time from the day that the Babylonians brought Jehoiachin to Babylon. Alternate translation: "eleven years, eleven months, and one day after the Babylonians took Jehoiachin to Babylon." (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **the word of Yahweh came to me and said** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16|3:16]].  
  * **Son of man** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01|2:3]].
  * **lift up  a lament concerning Pharaoh** - "mourn for Pharaoh by singing a song"  or "sing a sad song about the bad things that will happen to Pharaoh" 
  * **You are like a young lion** - This can be translated as "People think that you are like a young lion." Yahweh is now talking to Pharaoh. People think that Pharaoh has Power over the nations like a young lion has power over other animals. Alternate translation: "People think that you have power over the nations like a young lion has power over other animals." (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
  *  "like a young lion" This simile means that the King, "you", was "implusive" or "acting without thinking" or "aggresive". (See:  Simile).
  * **among the nations** - This means as one of a group of nations.
  * **But you are like a sea monster within the seas** - "But you are like a monster in the water" (See: Simile).
  * **you burst forth with your rivers. And you stir up waters with your feet; you muddy their rivers!** - "breaking out, causing trouble, and ruining (or 'making dirty') their clear water". The word rivers could refer to canals dug by the Egyptians.
