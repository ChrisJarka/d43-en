<usfm>
\v 17 Concerning the matters \add about which I will instruct you now\add*, I do not praise you, because whenever you believers meet together, good \add things do not happen\add*. Instead, bad things \add happen\add*.
\v 18 First of all, people have told me that when you gather together as a group \add to worship God\add*, you divide into groups \add that are hostile to each other\add*. To some extent I believe that is true.
\v 19 It seems that you must divide into \add groups that despise each other\add* in order that it might be clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* which people among you \add God\add* approves of!

\v 17 In these instructions, I cannot praise you for what you are doing about the Lord's supper. When you come together for communion, instead of encouraging and helping one another, it makes the fellowship and worship in the church much worse.
\v 18 The first matter of concern is that when you come together, you do not come together in Christian unity, but you come with different groups and factions. From the reports I have received, this seems to be the truth.
\v 19 There also seem to be well-defined groups that work against one another. These groups recognize some but they disqualify others.

\v 17 In the following instructions, I do not praise you, because when you come together, it is not for the better but for the worse.
\v 18 For in the first place, I hear that when you come together in the church, there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.
\v 19 For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may be recognized among you.
