======  Matthew 18 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== What should you do if "your brother sins against you" ==

In this chapter, Jesus teaches that it is important for his followers to try to end conflicts among themselves. He teaches that the local group of believers should be ready to help this to happen in a way that honors God. 

The church is also responsible for encouraging believers to [[en:obe:kt:repent|repent]] if they sin.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "Little Child" ==

This is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]] used this chapter. It is intended to compare the simple, child-like faith of those who [[:en:obe:kt:believe|believe]] in Jesus with those who reject him because they are too "grown up" to not need him.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Conditionals ==
There are several conditional statements in this chapter (verses 15-17). These sentences take a statement and add a condition to it. They are typically formed with the words "if" and "then." For example: "if it rains, then we will not have school" means that that there will be no school if it rains but there will be school if it rains. For example, "if it rains, we will not have school." Matthew omits the word "then" in his conditionals in chapter 18.
