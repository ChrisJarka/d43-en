\v 16 "When you abstain from eating food \add in order to please God\add*, do not look sad as the hypocrites look. They make their faces appear sad in order that people will see that they are abstaining from food \add and will think highly of them\add*. Keep this in mind: \add People will think highly of those people for that\add*, but\add that is the only\add* reward those people will get!
\v 17 Instead, \add each of\add* you, when you abstain from food, should comb your hair and wash your face \add as usual\add*,
\v 18 in order that other people will not notice that you are fasting\add because you will look as you always do\add*. But \add God\add*, your Father, whom no one can see, \add will observe that you are abstaining from food. God\add* your Father sees \add you\add* even though no one else sees \add you\add*, and he will reward you."

\v 16 When you keep from eating food in order to please God, do not look sad as the hypocrites look. They make their faces appear sad in order that people will see that they are not eating food and will think highly of them. Keep in mind that others will think highly of those people for that, but that is the only reward those people will get!
\v 17 Instead, each of you, when you keep from eating food, should comb your hair and wash your face as usual,
\v 18 in order that other people will not notice that you are fasting. But God, your Father, whom no one can see, will observe that you are not eating food. He sees you even though no one else sees you, and he will reward you.

\v 16 Moreover, when you fast, do not have a mournful face, as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces so that they may appear to people as fasting. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.
\v 17 But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
\v 18 so that you may not appear to people as fasting, but only to your Father who is in private. And your Father, who sees in private, will reward you.
