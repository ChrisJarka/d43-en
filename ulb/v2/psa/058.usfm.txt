\c 58
\d For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm
of David. Michtam.
\q
\v 1 Do you indeed in silence speak righteousness?
\q Do you judge uprightly, O you sons of men?
\q
\v 2 Nay, in heart you work wickedness;
\q You weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.
\q
\v 3 The wicked are estranged from the womb:
\q They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
\q
\v 4 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent:
\q They are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear,
\q
\v 5 Which heeds not to the voice of charmers,
\q Charming never so wisely.
\q
\v 6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth:
\q Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah.
\q
\v 7 Let them melt away as water that runs apace:
\q When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.
\q
\v 8 Let them be as a snail which melteth and passes away,
\q Like the untimely birth of a woman, that has not seen the sun.
\q
\v 9 Before your pots can feel the thorns,
\q He will take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.
\q
\v 10 The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance:
\q He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;
\q
\v 11 So that men shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous:
\q Verily there is a God that judges in the earth.
