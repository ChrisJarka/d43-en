===What is Hosea===

Hosea lived and ministered in the northern kingdom of Israel, which he often calls Ephraim or Samaria, just before Assyria conquered them. Hosea begins with the events of 753 BC, just before the death of Jeroboam II, when the kingdom of Israel was at its most powerful. Despite its prosperity, the kingdom of Israel was spiritually [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]]. Hosea predicts the demise of the kingdom of Israel and witnesses its destruction. The challenges and burdens Hosea was instructed to endure were unlike the burden  of any other prophet in the Bible. 

===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Hosea" may also be called the "The book about Hosea" or "The sayings of Hosea."

===Who wrote Hosea?===
Hosea, son of Beeri likely wrote this book. There is not much known about Hosea.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

===Why did God command Hosea to marry a prostitute?===
Hosea's marriage to the prostitute Gomer is a type of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] for the kingdom of Israel. This reveals that Israel has been [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful|unfaithful]] to Yahweh and has broken the [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|coveant]] with him in the way an adulterous wife is unfaithful and breaks the covenant with her husband. 

===What is a lawsuit?===
Many cultures have a process for resolving disputes through the use of courts. These legal disputes are called lawsuits. There is a lot of legal terms in Hosea and part of the book follows the form of a lawsuit. There is a problem that is identified (4:1), someone is accused (4:4), someone is found guilty (4:15) and there is judgment (5:1).

===What was the religious environment in the kingdom of Israel?===
While Israel was supposed to worship Yahweh alone, they combined the worship of Yahweh with the worship of the Canaanite [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]]. The god Baal was prominent in the time of Hosea. This was a major cause of God's judgment upon the kingdom of Israel.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

===What does the phrase "the declaration of Yahweh" mean?===

The prophet uses the phrase “the declaration of Yahweh” to introduce a prophetic passage.

===Why are English translations of Hosea very different?===

Hosea 4-14 has many difficult translation issues. Some have compared the difficulties with this section of Hosea with those that are found in the book of Job. Some phrases in Hosea are beyond the current understanding we have of the Hebrew language. Many English translations give very different translations for these difficult sections. He does not follow the pattern of other prophets. Hosea uses the words "I" and "he" in reference to himself. This shows the words of the prophet to be the words of Yahweh.

===What does the term Israel mean in Hosea?===
In Hosea, "Israel" is only used in reference to the northern kingdom of [[:en:obe:other:kingdomofisrael|Israel]] and is not used in reference to the nation of [[:en:obe:other:israel|Israel]] as a whole.
