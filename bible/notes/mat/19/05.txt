\v 5 That explains why \add God said\add*, '\add When\add* a man \add and woman marry\add*, they should no longer live with their fathers and mothers. \add Instead\add*, the two of them shall live together, and they shall become \add so closely united that they are like\add* one person \f + \ft metaphor \f*.'
\v 6 Consequently, \add although they functioned as\add* two \add separate people before\add*, they now \add become as if they were\add* one person \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Since that is true, a man must not separate \add from his wife\add* whom God has joined to him, \add because it is God's plan for them to remain together\add*."

\v 5 And that he said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.'
\v 6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh.' Therefore  what God has joined together, let no man tear apart."
