\v 17 So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.
\v 18 Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;
\v 19 and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
\v 20 Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.
