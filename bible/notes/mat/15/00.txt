======  Matthew 15 General Notes ======

=== Formatting in this chapter ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of verses 8 and 9, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Traditions ==
The "oral law," traditions" or the "traditions of the elders" are an important concept in this chapter. These are the laws the Pharisees and others constructed that were to be followed in addition to the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Laws of Moses]]. More often than not, the Jewish leaders viewed these laws as more important than the law of Moses. Jesus rebuke them for this belief, which made the Pharisees very angry.

== Jews and Gentiles ==
The response of the Gentiles is supposed to contrast the response of the Jewish leader. The Gentiles are shown to have the proper response to Jesus. This would have been a condemnation of the Pharisees and caused great offense to Jews. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Sheep ==

People are often pictured as sheep in Scripture. Matthew sheep as an image to illustrate that the Jews are lost without a shepherd to lead them properly.
