\v 19 If it please the king, let a royal decree be sent out from him, and let it be written in the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that can be repealed, that Vashti may not come before king Ahasuerus. Let the king give her position as queen to another who is better than she.
\v 20 When the kingâ€™s edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast kindom, all the wives will give honor to their husbands, from the greatest to the least significant."
