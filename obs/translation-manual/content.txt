===== What Needs To Be Translated =====

Our goal is to see Biblical content in every language of the world! Ultimately, we want the Bible translated into every language. But a Bible translation can take decades. In the mean time, we encourage Christians to translate Open Bible Stories so that they can have some solid Biblical content while the Bible translation is being completed. 

In an attempt to provide all of the tools necessary so that anybody can translate Biblical content into their own language we have developed the Gateway Langauges Strategy.

==== Gateway Languages Strategy ====

The objective of the gateway languages strategy is to equip 100% of the people groups that comprise the global Church with biblical content that is released from copyright restrictions and made available in a language they understand well (a language of wider communication) together with unrestricted translation training and tools that enable them to translate it into a language they understand fully (their own language). A “gateway language” is a language of wider communication through which second-language speakers of that language can gain access to content and translate it into their own language. 

The “gateway languages” at the world level comprise the smallest number of languages through which content can be delivered to every other language, via translation by bilingual speakers. For example, French is a gateway language for minority languages in Francophone Africa in that content available in French can be translated by bilingual speakers from French into their own languages.

At the country level, the gateway languages of a given country are the fewest languages of wider communication required for bilingual speakers in every minority language native to the country (not located there due to immigration) to gain access to content. For example, English is the gateway language for North Korea, given that all people groups native to North Korea can be reached by translation of content into their language from English.

The route that content travels from it’s source language to every other language may include more than one “intermediate gateway.” For example, source content in English en route to minority languages in southern Afghanistan may go from English to Persian to Dari to the receptor language.

The route through which content gets from one language to another is theoretically different for every source language. For example, the route between intermediate gateways for source content in French to get to every other language would be different than source content in English.

==== Everything That Needs To Be Translated for Non-Gateway Languages ====

If your language is not a Gateway language, the following content should be translated in order to print Open Bible Stories and make it available in the mobile apps:

  * [[en:obs|Open Bible Stories]]
  * [[en:obs:front-matter|Front Matter]]
  * [[en:obs:back-matter|Back Matter]]
  * [[en:obs:app_words|App Words]]

==== Everything That Needs To Be Translated for Gateway Languages ====

If your language is a Gateway Language, then your language will serve as a source text for other languages to translate. As a result, more content needs to be translated and all of it needs to be checked to Level 3 before it can be used as a source text for another language. Below is a list of everything that needs to be translated into each Gateway Language: 
  * [[en:obs|Open Bible Stories]]
  * [[en:obs:front-matter|Front Matter]]
  * [[en:obs:back-matter|Back Matter]]
  * [[en:obs:app_words|App Words]]
  * [[en:obs:notes|Translation Notes]]
