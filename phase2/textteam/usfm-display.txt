\s5
\c 1
\p
\v 1 This is the message of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, who wrote this. He is a priest, from the town of Anathoth in the area where the tribe of Benjamin lives.
\v 2 Yahweh started to give him these messages when Josiah had been ruling Judah for almost thirteen years.
\v 3 Yahweh continued to give him messages when Josiah's son Jehoiakim was the king, and he continued to do that until Zedekiah had been the king of Judah for almost eleven years. It was in the fifth month of that year that the people of Jerusalem were exiled to Babylonia.

\s5
\m
\v 4 One day Yahweh gave me this message,
\pi 
\v 5 "I knew you before I finished forming you in your mother's womb. Before you were born, I set you apart for my honor, and I appointed you to be my prophet for all the nations."
\m 
\v 6 I replied,
\pi "O, Yahweh my God, do you not see that I am not qualified to speak for you? I am very young!"
\m

\s5
\m
\v 7 Yahweh replied,
\pi "Do not say that, because you must go to everyone to whom I will send you, and you must tell them everything that I tell you to say.
\v 8 And you must not be afraid of the people to whom you will speak, because I will protect you from being harmed by them. This will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it!"
\m

\s5
\m
\v 9 Then it was as though Yahweh touched my mouth and said,
\pi "Listen to me! I have put my message into your mouth.
\v 10 Today I am appointing you to warn nations and kingdoms. You will tell them that I will completely destroy and get rid of  some of them and that I will establish others and cause them to be prosperous."
\m

\s5
\m
\v 11 Then Yahweh said to me,
\pi "Jeremiah, what do you see?"
\m I replied,
\pi "I see a branch from an almond tree."
\m
\v 12 Yahweh said,
\pi "That is correct. And because the word for 'almond' resembles the word for 'watching', it means that I am watching what will happen, and I will make certain that what I have said to you about destroying nations will happen."
\m

\s5
\m
\v 13 Then Yahweh spoke to me again and said,
\pi "What do you see now?"
\m I replied,
\pi "I see a pot full of boiling water. It is in the north, tipping toward me."
\m
\v 14 Yahweh replied,
\pi "Yes! It means that from the north great trouble will spread over this land, like boiling water pouring from a pot.

\s5
\v 15 Listen to what I say: I am summoning the armies of the kingdoms that are north of Judah to come to Jerusalem. Their kings will set up their thrones at the gates of this city to indicate that they are now the kings of Judah. Their armies will attack and break down the walls of this city, and they will do the same thing to all the other towns in Judah.
\v 16 I will punish my people because of all the evil things that they have done; they have abandoned me and they offer offerings of worship to false gods. They worship idols that they have made with their own hands!

\s5
\v 17 So, get up and put on your clothes to get ready for action! Then go to the people of Judah and tell them everything that I tell you to say. Do not be afraid of them, because if you are afraid of them, I will punish you as an example right in front of them!
\v 18 But listen! I will cause you to be strong, like a city that has strong walls around it. You will be as strong as an iron pillar or a bronze wall. Neither the royal officials or priests nor the general populace will be able to defeat you.
\v 19 They will oppose you, but they will not be able to defeat you, because I will be with you and will protect you. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it!"
\m

\s5
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message
\v 2 to proclaim to everyone in Jerusalem. He said that I should tell them this, 
\pi "I, Yahweh, remember in your favor that you followed me and trusted in our covenant long ago. You tried to please me like a bride tries to please her husband; You loved me, and you followed me through the desert.
\v 3 At that time you Israelites were set apart to me; you belonged to me like the first part of the harvests belong to me.
I promised to punish all those who harmed you, my people, and send disasters on them. This is the way it will always be since I, Yahweh, said that it would happen."
\m

\s5
\v 4 So I say to you, the descendants of Jacob, all you people of  Israel, that you must listen to what Yahweh says.
\v 5 He says,
\pi "What sin did I commit that caused your ancestors to turn far away from me? They worshiped worthless idols, and they themselves became worthless.
\v 6 They had no need to say,
\pi2 'Yahweh is no longer able to help us, even though it was he who brought us safely out of Egypt and led us through a desert plain where there were a lot of pits. It was Yahweh who led us where there was no water and where it was very dangerous, through a land where no one lives or even travels. But Yahweh is useless for us now.'
\m

\s5
\pi
\v 7 But when I, Yahweh, brought you into a very fertile land, in order that you could enjoy all the fruit and other good things that you would harvest, you caused the land that I promised to give to you to be unfit for me and to become disgusting to me.
\v 8 Your priests also did not ask if I was still with them. Those who teach God's laws are not faithful to me themselves! And your leaders have rebelled against me. Your prophets gave you messages from their god Baal, and they worship worthless idols.

\s5
\v 9 So, I will accuse you in court. In future years, I will also bring your children and your grandchildren to trial! That will happen because I, Yahweh, have said that it will happen.
\v 10 If you go west to the island of Cyprus, or if you go east to Kedar land, and if you ask people in those places, they will tell you that no people from their countries have ever done the wicked things that you people have done!
\v 11 No people of any nation have ever  abandoned their gods that they thought were glorious and started to worship gods that are not really gods, but you people have abandoned me, your glorious God, and are worshiping gods that are useless.

\s5
\v 12 It is as though everything in the sky is dismayed about what you have done; it is as though they tremble because they are very horrified.
\v 13 You, my people, have done two evil things: you have rejected me, the one who is like  a fountain where you can obtain fresh water, and you are worshiping gods that are like  pits in the ground that are cracked and which are not able to hold any water.

\s5
\v 14 You Israelite people, you were certainly not  slaves when you were born; so why were you captured by your enemies?
\v 15 Your enemies  roared like lions, and they destroyed your land. Now your towns have been burned, and no one lives in them.
\v 16 Soldiers from Memphis and Tahpenes, cities in Egypt, have defeated you and shaved your heads to show that you are their slaves.
\v 17 But it is  because you abandoned me, Yahweh, that these disasters have happened to you, since I had been leading your to safety.

\s5
\v 18 So why are you trying to make an alliance with the rulers of Egypt who live near the Shihor? Why are you trying to make an alliance with  the rulers of Assyria who live near the Euphrates River?
\v 19 It is because you have been very wicked that I  will punish you. It is because you have turned away from me that I  will condemn you. When I do that, you will realize that bitter and evil  things will happen to you because you have forsaken me, Yahweh, your God, and you no longer have an awesome respect for me. That will certainly happen because I, the Lord, Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies in heaven, have said it.

\s5
\v 20 Long ago, you stopped obeying me and you would not allow me to lead you; you refused to worship me. Instead, you worship idols that are under trees on the top of every hill and your young women sleep with  men at those places.
\v 21 It is as though you were a grapevine that I planted when it was a cutting from a very good vine. So now it is disgusting that  you have become like a rotten worthless vine.
\v 22 Your guilt from your sins is like  very bad stains on a cloth, and you cannot get rid of those stains even by using very strong soap. This is true because I, Yahweh, have said it.

\s5
\v 23 You say that you have not sinned. You claim to be acceptable to God and that you have not worshipped Baal. But think about the disgusting things that you do very eagerly in Hinnom Valley outside Jerusalem. You are like desperate female camels, running here and there to find male camels to sleep with.
\v 24 You are like wild female donkeys in the desert. They sniff the air to find where the male donkeys are, and no one can  restrain them. The male donkeys that want them do not tire themselves out searching for them, because at mating time they find them easily.
\v 25 You constantly run here and there to find idols to worship, with the result that your sandals are worn out, and your throats have become dry. I told you to stop doing that but you said, that you could not stop, and you said that you loved those foreign gods and had to worship them!

\s5
\v 26 A robber is disgraced when he is caught. And all of you, including your kings and priests and prophets, are similarly disgraced.
\v 27 You call a piece of wood that is carved to become a sacred idol, your father, and you call a stone that you have set up, your mother. You have rejected me but when you experience troubles, you shout to me to rescue you!
\v 28 Why do you not  shout to the gods that you made? Why do you not plead with them to rescue you when you experience disasters? For you have as many gods as you have cities and towns in Judah!

\s5
\v 29 You complain that it was wrong for me not to have rescued you, but you have all rebelled against me.
\v 30 I punished some of you, but you did not learn anything from my doing that. Instead you have killed many of the prophets that I sent to you, like  fierce lions kill other animals.
\v 31 You people of Israel, pay attention to what I say. I have certainly  never abandoned you in a desert; I have never left you in a very dark land. So, why do you, my people, say, that you are free from my control and that you will not return to worship me anymore?

\s5
\v 32 A young woman would certainly never  forget to wear her jewelry, and a bride would never  forget to wear her wedding dress, but you my people have forgotten me for many years.
\v 33 You know how to easily find gods from other countries whom you can love. You can find them more easily than a prostitute can find men to sleep with. You could teach her about infidelity!
\v 34 Although you have on your clothes the blood of poor people whom you have murdered, people who were innocent! You did not catch them robbing you, but you chose to treat her wickedly.

\s5
\v 35 Yet you say, that you have not done anyhting wrong, and you believe that I will not be angry with you. But I will punish  you severely for claiming that you have not sinned.
\v 36 Previously you requested the army of Assyria to help you, but they were not able to help you. Now you have requested the army of Egypt to help you, but they will not be able to help you, either.
\v 37 They will capture you, and you will be their prisoners, led to Egypt, very ashamed with your hands on your heads. That will happen because I, Yahweh, have rejected those nations that you are relying on, and they will not be able to help you at all."

\s5
\m
\c 3
\pi
\v 1 "I, Yahweh, instructed Moses to write that if a man divorces his wife and then she marries another man, her first husband certainly must not  take her back again to be his wife, because that would certainly  cause the whole nation to become unacceptable to me. But you have more idols than prostitutes have men whom they have slept with! So, why should I accept you if you return to me?—says Yahweh.
\v 2 Look up at the barren hilltops. On every hilltop there are  idols that you have worshiped. It is as though they are all lovers with whom you have slept. It is as though you have sat along the roadsides like an Arab, waiting to attack and steal things from those who pass by. Because of worshiping idols and all the other wicked things that you have done, you have caused the entire land to become unacceptable to me.

\s5
\v 3 That is why I have not sent you any rain at the times of the year when you needed it. But you are like prostitutes who are not at all ashamed for what they have done.
\v 4 Now each of you says to me,
\pi2 'You are my father! You have loved me ever since I was young!
\v 5 So surely you will not  be angry with me forever!'
\pi But you will not quit sinning!"
\m

\s5
\m
\v 6 One day when Josiah was the king of Judah, Yahweh said to me,
\pi "Have you seen what the people of Israel have done? They have turned away from me, like a woman who has abandoned her husband and sleeps with other men. They have gone up on every hilltop and under every big tree and worshiped idols there .
\v 7 I thought that they would return to me, so I said to them,
\pi2 'Come back to me!'
\pi But they refused. The people of Judah were watching all of this.

\s5
\v 8 So I sent the people of Israel away to other countries, like a man writes a note saying that he is divorcing his wife and then sends his wife away because she has committed adultery. The people of Judah saw what I did to them, but they are just like the people of Israel. They are not afraid of what I will do to them. They also have turned away from me and are worshiping idols like women who abandon their husbands and go to other men .
\v 9 They did not care that worshiping idols offended me, so they have made the entire land unacceptable to me by worshiping idols of wood and stone.
\v 10 The people of Judah have pretended to return to me, but they have not really done that. This is true because I, Yahweh, have said it."
\m

\s5
\m
\v 11 Then Yahweh said to me, Jeremiah,
\pi "The people of Israel have turned away from me, but what the people of Judah have done is worse.
\v 12 So go and tell this to the people of Israel,
\pi2 'Yahweh says this to you Israelite people who have turned away from him: I am merciful. I will not continue to be angry with you forever. So return to me.

\s5
\v 13 But you must admit that you are guilty, and that you have rebelled against me, Yahweh, your God, that you have worshiped idols under big trees everywhere, and you have not obeyed me. You have turned away from me.
\v 14 But you belong to me, so come back to me, my children! If you do, I will take you, one from each city and two from each clan, and bring you back to Jerusalem
\v 15 If you do that, I will appoint for you leaders with whom I am pleased who will guide you well because they will know and understand what pleases me.

\s5
\v 16 And when you become very numerous in your land, you will not need to talk about the Sacred Chest that contained the Ten Commandments. You will not think about it, and you will not want to make a new one.'

\s5
\pi
\v 17 At that time people will say that my throne is in Jerusalem. People from all nations will come there to worship me, and they will no longer stubbornly do the evil things that they desire in their inner beings.
\v 18 At that time you people of Israel and Judah will return from being exiled in lands to the north. You will return to the land that I gave to your ancestors to belong to them forever.

\s5
\v 19 You people of Israel, I wanted to accept you to be my children. I wanted to give you this delightful land. It is a land more desirable than the land of any other nation! I wanted you to call me your father, and I wanted you to never turn away from me.
\v 20 But you have abandoned me like wives who have abandoned their husbands."
\m That is what Yahweh said, and I told it to the people of Israel.

\s5
\v 21 Then God said,
\pi "People will hear a noise on the barren hilltops. It will be the noise made by people weeping and pleading for God to be merciful to them. They will be admitting that they have forgotten Yahweh their God, and that they turned away from behaving as God wanted them to.
\v 22 You Israelite people, come back to me! If you do that, I will cause you to never turn away from me again."
\m The people will reply,
\pi "We are returning to you, because you are Yahweh, our God.

\s5
\v 23 We did not get any help from the idols that we worshiped on the hilltops, we did not get any help from making all that noise up there. We now recognize that Yahweh our God is the only way Israel will be saved!
\v 24 From the time when we were young, the shameful god Baal has taken away from us everything that our ancestors worked hard to acquire. He has taken away their flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, their sons and their daughters.
\v 25 So, now we should lie down feeling very ashamed, because we and our ancestors have sinned against Yahweh our God, and we have never obeyed him."
\m

\s5
\c 4
\m
\v 1 Yahweh says,
\pi "You Israelite people, if you come back to anyone, it should be to me. If you get rid of those detestable idols, if you do not go away from me again,
\v 2 and if you declare,
\pi2 'Just as surely as Yahweh lives, what he says is true and just, and he teaches righteous living,'
\pi then the people in the other nations of the world will ask me to bless them as I have blessed you, and they will all come and honor me."
\m
\v 3 This is what Yahweh says to the people of Jerusalem and the other cities in Judah,
\pi "Cause your inner beings to be ready to receive my messages like farmers plow up hard ground in order that they can plant seed in it. Just as farmers do not waste good seed by sowing seeds among thorny plants, I do not want to waste my time telling you messages that you are not ready to receive.

\s5
\v 4 Show that your inner beings and your minds are devoted to me. If you do not do that, my being angry with you because of all the sins that you have committed will be like a fire that will be impossible to extinguish.
\v 5 Declare this  to all the people in Jerusalem and the rest of Judea; blow the trumpets everywhere in the land to warn the people. Tell them that they should flee to the cities that have high walls around them.
\v 6 Shout to the people of Jerusalem,
\pi2 'Run away now! Do not delay, because I am about to bring a terrible disaster  upon you that will come from the north.'

\s5
\pi
\v 7 An army that has destroyed many nations will attack you like  a lion that comes out of its den to attack other animals. The soldiers of that army are already marching toward your land. They will destroy your cities and leave them without any people still living in them.
\v 8 So, put on rough clothes and weep and beat your breasts to show that you are very sorry for what you have done, because Yahweh is still very angry with us.


\s5
\v 9 Yahweh declares that at the time when Yahweh punishes you, the king of Judah and all his officials will be very afraid. The priests and the prophets will be terrified."
\m
\v 10 Then I replied,
\pi "Yahweh my God, you completely deceived the people by telling them that there would be peace in Jerusalem, but now our enemies  are ready to slaughter us with their swords!"


\s5
\m
\v 11 When that happens, Yahweh will say to the people of Jerusalem,
\pi "A huge army will come to attack you. They will not be like a gentle breeze that separates the wheat from the chaff. They will be like a very hot wind that blows in from the desert .
\v 12 They will be like a strong blast that I will send. Now I am declaring that I will punish you."


\s5
\v 13 Our enemies are about to rush down on us; their chariots are like  whirlwinds. Their horses are faster than eagles. It will be terrible for us!
\v 14 You people of Jerusalem  cleanse your inner beings, in order that Yahweh will rescue you. How long will you continue to think about doing evil deeds?
\v 15 From the city of Dan in the far north to the hills of Ephraim a few miles north of Jerusalem messengers are proclaiming that disasters are coming.

\s5
\v 16 Tell this to the people in other nations but also announce it in Jerusalem: Yahweh says that an army is coming to Jerusalem from far away; they will shout a battle cry against the cities of Judah.
\v 17 They will set up tents around Jerusalem like people set up temporary shelters  around a field at harvest time. That will happen because the people of Judah have rebelled against me.
\v 18 You will be punished very severely; it will be as though a sword has stabbed your hearts. But you are causing those things to happen to you because of the evil things that you have done."

\s5
\m
\v 19 Then I said to myself,
\pi "I am extremely anguished; the pain in my inner being is very severe. My heart beats wildly! But I cannot remain silent because I have heard our enemies blowing their trumpets to announce that the battle against Judah will start immediately!
\v 20 Disasters will occur one after another until the whole land is ruined. Suddenly all our tents will be destroyed; even the curtains inside the tents will be ripped apart.

\s5
\v 21 How long will this battle continue? How long will I continue to see the enemy battle flags and hear the sound of their trumpets being blown?
\v 22 Yahweh says: My people are very foolish! They do not have a relationship with me. They are like  stupid children who do not understand anything. They very cleverly do what is wrong, but they do not know how to do what is good.

\s5
\v 23 God gave me a vision in which I saw that the earth was barren and without form. I looked at the sky,and there was no light there.
\v 24 I looked at the mountains and hills, and they shook and moved from side to side.
\v 25 I looked and saw that all there were no more people and all the birds had flown away.
\v 26 I looked and saw that the fields that previously were fertile had become a desert. The cities were all ruined; they had all been destroyed by Yahweh because he was extremely angry."

\s5
\m
\v 27 This is what Yahweh is saying,
\pi "the entire land of Judah will be ruined, but I will not destroy it completely.
\v 28 I will do to my people what I said that I would do,and I will not change my mind.
So when that happens, it will be as though the earth will mourn and the sky will become very dark.
\v 29 When the people hear the sound of the enemy cavalry and archers marching,they will be terrified as they flee from their cities. Some of them will find places to hide in the bushes, and others will run toward the quarries to escape being killed by their enemies. All the cities in Judah will be abandoned; not one person will remain in them.

\s5
\v 30 So you who will surely be destroyed, what will you do then? Even though you have worn beautiful clothes and jewelry and paint around your eyes, those things will not help you, because the people in other countries that you think love you really despise you, and they will try to kill you.
\v 31 It is as though I already hear the people in Jerusalem crying very loudly, as a woman cries when she is giving birth to her first child; she gasps for breath and pleads for someone to help her, and she shouts,
\pi2 'Something terrible is happening to me; they are about to murder me!'"
\m

\s5
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to the people of Jerusalem,
\pi "Go up and down every street. Search in the marketplaces to find people who do what is fair, who try to be faithful to me. If you find even one person like that, I will forgive the people of Jerusalem and not destroy their city.
\v 2 But when people there say,
\pi2 'I solemnly declare that as surely as Yahweh lives, I will do what he says,'
\pi they are lying."
\m
\v 3 Yahweh, you are certainly searching for people who are faithful to you. You punished your people, but they did not pay any attention. You crushed them, but they ignored what you were telling them to do. They were extremely stubborn and refused to return to you.

\s5
\v 4 I thought,
\pi "We cannot expect these people to act righteously, because they are poor; they do not have any sense. They do not know the way Yahweh wants them to conduct their lives; they do not know what God requires them to do.
\v 5 So, I will go and talk to their leaders, because they surely know how God wants them to conduct their lives."
\m But they also have stopped obeying Yahweh, and they will not allow him to lead them.
\v 6 Because of that, lions will come out of the forests and kill them; wolves from the desert will attack them; leopards that lurk outside their cities will maul anyone who walks outside the cities. Those things will happen because the people have sinned very much against God and have turned away from him very frequently.

\s5
\v 7 Yahweh says,
\pi "I cannot  forgive these people; even their children have abandoned me. When they solemnly declare something, they ask their gods to show that what they say is true. I gave my people everything that they needed, but they often went to the shrines of their idols and committed adultery there.
\v 8 Just like  well fed male horses neigh, wanting to mate with female horses, each of the men desires to sleep with his neighbor's wife.
\v 9 Should I not punish them for this ? I will certainly get revenge  on this nation whose people behave like that!

\s5
\v 10 I will say to your enemies,
\pi2 'The people of Judah and Israel are like a vineyard. Go along the rows in their vineyards and get rid of most of the people, but do not kill all of them. These people do not belong to me, so get rid of them, like a gardener lops off branches from a vine.
\v 11 The people of Israel and Judah have turned away from me completely.'
\pi 
\v 12 They have lied about me and said,
\pi2 'He is not even real! He will not punish us! He will not send disasters on us! We will not experience wars or famines!
\v 13 What God's prophets say is nothing but wind! They do not have messages from God! And because they have not believed me, all of these things will happen to them!'"

\s5
\m
\v 14 So, this is what Yahweh, the commander of the armies of angels in heaven, has said to me,
\pi "Because my people are saying those things,I will give you a message to tell them that will be like a fire, and these people will be like  wood that the fire will burn up completely!
\v 15 Listen to this, you people of Israel: I will bring the army of a distant nation to attack you. It is a very powerful nation that has existed for a long time. They speak a language that you do not know, and which you will not be able to understand.

\s5
\v 16 Their soldiers are all very strong, and the arrows from their quivers will send many Judean men to their graves.
\v 17 They will eat the food that you have harvested from your fields, even though it should be your own children who eat your bread. They will kill your flocks of sheep and herds of cattle. They will eat your grapes and your figs. They will also destroy your cities that have high walls around them and kill the people with their swords.

\s5
\v 18 But even when those things happen, I will not get rid of all of you.
\v 19 And when the people ask,
\pi2 'Why is Yahweh doing this to us?'
\pi you will tell them,
\pi2 'You rejected him and worshiped foreign gods in your own land,
so now you will become slaves of foreigners in a land that is not your land.'"

\s5
\m
\v 20 Yahweh instructed me to proclaim this message to the people of Israel and Judah,
\pi
\v 21 "Listen to this, you people who are foolish and who do not have any sense: You have eyes, but it is as though you cannot see; you have ears, but it is as though you cannot hear.
\v 22 Why do you not have any awesome respect for me? You should  tremble when you are in my presence! I, Yahweh, am the one who put a barrier along the shores so that the waters of the ocean cannot cross it and flood the land. The waves roll and roar, but they cannot go past that barrier.

\s5
\v 23 But you people are not like the waves that obey me. You people are very stubborn and rebellious, and have constantly turned away from me.
\v 24 You do not say to yourselves that you should have an awesome respect for Yahweh your God, the one who sends you rain at the times that you need it, the one who causes the grain to become ripe at the harvest season.
\v 25 It is because of the wrong things that you have done, that those good things have not happened; It is because of the sins that you have committed that you have been prevented from receiving those blessings.

\s5
\v 26 Among my people are wicked people who hide along the roads to ambush people like men who hunt birds put nets to catch them.
\v 27 Like a hunter has a cage full of birds that he has captured, their homes are full of things that they have gotten by deceiving others so now they are very rich and powerful.
\v 28 They are big and fat because they eat rich food, and there is no limit to the evil deeds that they have done. In court, they do not help ordinary people get judges to decide fairly for them, and they do not try to defend orphans. They do not even want to listen to them in court.
\v 29 So I will certainly  punish them for doing those things. I will certainly get revenge on their nation.

\s5
\v 30 Very appalling things are happening in this country:
\v 31 Prophets speak only lies and priests rule by their own authority, yet you people like that! But when you start to experience disasters, what will you do?

\s5
\c 6
\pi
\v 1 You people in Jerusalem who are from the tribe of Benjamin, flee from this city! Blow the trumpets in the city of Tekoa south of Jerusalem! Send up a smoke signal in the city of Beth Hakerem to warn the people of the coming danger! A powerful army will come against you from the north, and they will cause great destruction.
\v 2 Jerusalem is like a beautiful woman, but it will soon be destroyed.
\v 3 Enemy kings, the shepherds of foreign people groups, will come with their armies and set up their tents around the city, and each king will choose a part of the city for his soldiers to destroy as shepherds divide their pastures for their flocks of sheep.

\s5
\v 4 The kings will tell their troops, "Make the sacrifices necessary to get ready for battle. We should attack them before noontime, but even if we arrive there late in the afternoon,
\v 5 we will attack them at night and tear down their fortresses."

\s5
\m
\v 6 Yahweh, the commander of the armies of angels in heaven, says this,
\pi "I will command those soldiers to cut down the trees outside Jerusalem and to build ramps up to the top of the city walls! This city must be punished because everyone there continually oppresses others.
\v 7 Its people keep doing wicked deeds, just as a well keeps producing water. The noise from people doing violent and destructive actions is heard everywhere. I continually see people who are suffering and wounded.
\v 8 Listen to what I am warning you, you people of Jerusalem, because if you do not listen, I will reject you and cause your land to become desolate, a land where no one lives."

\s5

\v 9 Yahweh, the commander of the angel armies, says this,
\pi "I will tell your enemies to cause your country to become as desolate as a vineyard from which all the grapes have been completely stripped from the vines. I will tell their soldiers to seize the possessions of those who remain in Israel after the others have been exiled like farmers go to the vines again to pick any grapes that were left."
\m
\v 10 Then I said,
\pi "If I speak to the Israelite people to warn them, who will listen to me? It is as though their ears are closed, and as a result they cannot hear what I say. They scorn Yahweh's messages; they do not want to listen to them at all.

\s5
\v 11 But I am very angry, as Yahweh is angry, and I cannot hold myself back any longer."
\m So Yahweh said to me,
\pi "Tell the children in the streets and the young men who gather together. Tell the men and their wives; tell the very old people, also.
\v 12 Tell the men that I will give their houses to their enemies, and I will give their property and their wives to them, also, when I punish the people who live in this land!

\s5
\v 13 Everyone is trying to get money by tricking others, from the most important people to the least important people; even the prophets and the priests are trying to deceive people to get money.
\v 14 They act as though the sins of my people are like small wounds that they can easily treat. They continually comfort people by saying 'I hope things are going well with you,' when things are not going well.
\v 15 They should be ashamed about the disgusting things that they do, but they are not ashamed at all. They do not even know how to blush. So, they also will be among those who will be killed. They will be destroyed when I punish them."

\s5
\m
\v 16 This is also what Yahweh said to the Israelite people,
\pi "Stand at the crossroads and look at the people who pass by. Ask them what was the good behavior that their ancestors had long ago. And when they tell you, behave that way. If you do that, you will find rest for yourselves. But you said that you did not want to do that!
\v 17 I sent my prophets who were like watchmen. They told you to listen carefully when the trumpets blow to warn you that your enemies are approaching, bur you did not want to listen.
\v 18 Therefore, you people in the other nations, listen to this: Pay attention to what is going to happen to the Israelite people.
\v 19 Listen, all of you! I am going to cause disasters to happen to the Israelite people. That is what will happen to them because they have refused to listen to what I told them. They have refused to obey my laws.

\s5
\v 20 You Israelite people, when you burn frankincense that came from Sheba and when you offer to me sweet-smelling anointing oil that came from far away, I will not  be pleased with your sacrifices. I will not accept the sacrifices that are completely burned on the altar; I am not pleased with any of your sacrifices.
\v 21 Therefore, I will put obstacles on the roads on which my people will travel. Men and their sons and people's neighbors and friends will stumble over those obstacles and fall down; everyone will die."
\m
\v 22 Yahweh also says this,
\pi "You will see a huge army marching towards you from the north. An army of a great nation very far away is preparing to attack you.

\s5
\v 23 They have bows and arrows and spears; they are very cruel, and do not act mercifully to anyone. As they ride along on their horses, the horses' feet sound like the roaring of the ocean waves; they are riding in battle formation to attack you people of Jerusalem."
\m
\v 24 The people of Jerusalem say,
\pi "We have heard reports about the enemy; so we are very frightened, with the result that we are weak. We are very afraid, and worried, like women who are about to give birth to babies.

\s5
\v 25 So one person says to another,
\pi2 'Do not go out into the fields! Do not go on the roads, because the enemy soldiers have swords and they are everywhere; they are coming from all directions, and we are extremely afraid.'"
\m
\v 26 So I, Jeremiah, say say to you,
\pi "My dear people, put on rough clothes and sit in ashes to show that you are sorry for your sins. Mourn and cry very much, as a woman would cry if her only son had died. For your enemies are very near, and they are going to destroy everything. Prepare for your own funerals "


\s5
\m
\v 27 Then Yahweh said to me,
\pi "Jeremiah, I have caused you to become like someone who heats metal very hot to completely burn the impurities. You will examine my people's behavior.
\v 28 You will find out that they are very stubborn rebels: they are always slandering others. Their inner beings are as hard as bronze or iron; they all continually deceive others.
\v 29 A metalworker causes the bellows to blow very hard to make the fire very hot to completely burn up the impurities. But just as a fire does not cause all the waste material to run off, it is impossible to separate the  people from their wicked deeds.
\v 30 I, Yahweh, have rejected them; I say that they are like worthless silver."
