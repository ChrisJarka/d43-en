===== Translation Notes: =====
Description of the army continues

    * **horses** -  a large animal with four legs and face that is long head, that is used for carrying or pulling heavy loads, riding, or racing. (See:[[en:ta:translate:translateunknowns]])
    * **The army's appearance is like horses**  - There seem to be two ways to understand this: Literally, The army: a cloud of locust appear to be small horse; or figuratively "The army is strong and in good fitness". (See:[[en:ta:translate:simile]])
    * **they** - This word refers to the army.
    * **they run like horsemen**  - This means the army moves quickly, as men riding horses would. (See:[[en:ta:translate:simile]])
    * **jump with a noise like that of of chariots on the tops of the mountains...Like the noise of fiery flames that devour the stubble,
Like a mighty army ready for battle.**  - This emphasizes that when the army jumps it makes a lot of noise as a two wheeled cart rolled over many rocks, or a fire burning a field, or a large army would. (See:[[en:ta:translate:simile]])
