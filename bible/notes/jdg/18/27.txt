\v 27 The people of Dan took what Micah had made, and the priest whom he had possessed, and came to Laish, to a people who were quiet and living in peace; they struck down them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.
\v 28 There was no one to save them because it was far from Sidon, and the people had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob. The people of Dan rebuilt the city and lived in it.
\v 29 They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel. But the name of the city had been Laish at first.
