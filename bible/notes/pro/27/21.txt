===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **And a person is tested when he is praised **- As the refiner tries the silver and gold, so is a man's character by the praise he receives. Similar sentence is observed in Proverbs 17:3.
  * **Though you should crush the fool with the pestle - along with the grain **- AT: "Though you should crush the fool in a mortar among grain with the pestle." The nature of the fool is retained even after punishment. (See: Metaphor)
