\v 3 Then he said to me, "On this scroll is written the \add words that Yahweh is speaking to\add* curse the entire country. On one side of the scroll it is written that every thief will be banished. On the other side it is written that everyone who tells a lie when he is solemnly promising to tell the truth will also be banished from the country.
\v 4 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says, 'I will send \add copies of\add* this scroll to the places where thieves live and to the houses of those who use my name when they solemnly promise to tell the truth. \add The copies of\add* this scroll will stay in their houses, until those houses and all their wood and stones are destroyed.'~"

\v 3 Then said he to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole land: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off on the one side according to it; and every one that swears shall be cut off on the other side according to
it.
\v 4 I will cause it to go forth, says Jehovah of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that swears falsely by my name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.
