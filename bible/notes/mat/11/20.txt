===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 20 The people, who lived in the towns in the area where Jesus was, saw him perform many miracles. But they did not turn away from their sinful behavior. So Jesus began to rebuke them by saying to them, \v 21 "You people who live in the city of Chorazin and you in the city of Bethsaida, how terribly you will suffer! I did great miracles in your cities, but you did not stop sinning. If I had done these things in the cities of Tyre and Sidon of long ago, those wicked people would certainly have stopped sinning; they would have put on rough clothing and sat in the cold ashes of their fires, so sorry they would have been. \v 22 Let me tell you this: God will punish the wicked people who lived in the cities of Tyre and Sidon, but he will punish you even more severely on the final day when he judges all people. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 20 Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his great deeds were done, because they had not repented. \v 21 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. \v 22 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you. </usfm>

  * **great deeds**  - This can be translated "mighty works" or "works of power" or "miracles." Note that this is the same word in the original Greek as is translated "mighty works" in verse 21.
  * **because they had not repented**  - The pronoun "they" refers to the people in the cities that had not repented.
  * **Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida**  - Jesus speaks as if the people of the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida were there listening to him, but they were not. (See: Apostrophe)
