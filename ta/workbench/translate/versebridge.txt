This module answers the question: Why are some verse numbers combined, such as "3-5" or "17-18"?\\

===== Description =====
In some rare cases, you will see in the Unlocked Literal Bible (ULB) or the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB) that two or more verse numbers are combined, such as 17-18. This is called a verse bridge. It shows where the order of the verses was rearranged so that the story or message could be more easily or logically understood.

<sup>29</sup> These were the clans of the Horites: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, and Anah, <sup>30</sup> Dishon, Ezer, Dishan: these are clans of the Horites, according to their clan lists in the land of Seir. (Genesis 26:29-30 ULB)

<sup>29-30</sup> The people groups who were descendants of Hor lived in Seir land. The names of the people groups are Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishpan. Genesis 26:29-30 UDB

In the ULB text above, verses 29 and 30 are separate. In the UDB text, verses 29 and 30 are joined. The information about the people living in Seir is at the end of verse 30 in the ULB, and is in the first sentence of verses 29-30 in the UDB.

You may need to arrange information in a way that people will be able to understand it well.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

17-18 **Ezrah's sons were Jether, Mered, Epher, and Jalon. Mered's Egyptian wife bore Miriam, Shammai, and Ishbah, who became the father of Eshtemoa. These were the sons of Bithiah, daughter of Pharaoh, whom Mered married. Mered's Jewish wife bore Jered, who became the father of Gedor; Heber, who became the father of Soco; and Jekuthiel, who became the father of Zanoah.**
(1 Chronicles 4:17-18)

<sup>12-13</sup>**Kings of armies flee, they flee,** \\ 
**and the women waiting at home divide the plunder:** \\ 
**doves covered with silver** \\
**with wings of yellow gold.**\\
**When some of you people stayed among the sheepfolds, why did you do this?** (Psalm 68:12-13 ULB)

===== Translation Strategies =====

If the ULB has a verse bridge, but another Bible you refer to does not have one, you can choose the order that works best for your language.

If you feel you need to combine verses in your translation in order to make it sound logical or clearer, you may do that and indicate it by putting a hyphen between the verse numbers, as above.

See: [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:talink-verse-bridge-tech-manual|talink Verse Bridge Tech Manual]]

<sup>28</sup> **All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar. <sup>29</sup> At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,**  (Daniel 4:28-29 in the  American Standard Version)

And here is how the two verses were combined to make the meaning more clear:

<sup>28-29</sup> **All these things happened to King Nebuchadnezzar in twelve months. He was walking at the royal palace in Babylon.**
