\v 13 God, who gives life to all things, knows everything that you do. Christ Jesus also knows everything that you do. He strongly declared what was true when he was on trial before Pontius Pilate.
\v 14 So as you remember those things, I command you to hold tightly on to what Christ has commanded us in every way. Hold fast to those teachings in a way that our Lord Jesus Christ cannot criticize you about what is wrong, until he comes again.

\v 14 keep the commandment perfectly, above reproach, until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ.
