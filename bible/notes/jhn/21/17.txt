\v 17 Jesus said to him a third time, "John's son Simon, am I really dear to you \f + \ft Or: do you really love me \f*?" Peter was grieved because Jesus asked him this three times, \add and because the third time he changed the question\add*. He said, "Lord, you know everything. You know that you are dear to me \f + \ft Or: that I love you \f*." Jesus said, "Give to \add those who belong to\add* me \add what they need spiritually, as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add a shepherd provides\add* food for \add his\add* sheep.
\v 18 Now listen to this carefully: When you were young, you put your clothes on by yourself, and you went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will stretch out your arms, and someone will fasten them \add with a rope\add* and will lead you to a place where you do not want to \add go\add*."

\v 17 He says to him the third time, Simon, son of John, love you me? Peter was grieved because he said to
him the third time, Lovest you me? And he said to him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love thee. Jesus
says to him, Feed my sheep.
\v 18 Verily, verily, I say to thee, When you was young, you girdedst thyself, and walked whither you wouldest: but
when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you whither you would
not.
