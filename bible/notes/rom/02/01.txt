\v 1  \add God will severely punish non-Jewish people who habitually do evil deeds, because he has clearly revealed that he is angry with them\add*. So, \add when God judges people\add*, he will not excuse any one of you Jews  \add to whom I am writing\add*. You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* say that  \add God should\add* punish  \add non-Jews for doing evil deeds\add*. But when any one of you says that, it is yourself whom you are saying that God should punish, because you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* do  \add some of\add* the same  \add evil\add* deeds  \add that the non-Jews do\add*.
\v 2 We know very well that God will judge and punish fairly  \add non-Jewish\add* people who do such  \add evil\add* deeds.

\v 1  God will severely punish people who habitually do evil deeds, because he has clearly revealed that he is angry with them. So when God judges people, he will not excuse any one of you, my Jewish friends. You say that God should punish non-Jews for doing evil deeds. But when any one of you says that, you are really saying that God should punish yourself, because you do some of the same evil deeds  that the non-Jews do.
\v 2 We know very well that God will judge and punish fairly non-Jewish people who do such evil deeds.
