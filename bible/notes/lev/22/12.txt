<usfm>
\v 12 If a priest's daughter marries a man who is not a priest, she no longer is permitted to eat the sacred food that anyone has presented to me.
\v 13 But suppose that a priest's daughter who has no children becomes a widow or becomes divorced, and suppose also that she returns to her father's house to live there as she did when she was young. In that case, she may eat the same food that her father eats. But no other person is permitted to eat any of it.
