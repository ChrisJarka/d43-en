====== Group Process for Creating Translation Notes ======


The way the notes team form and meet varies. However, there are some standard thinks that we would like to happen in every group. 

=== Finish Chapters ===

It is easier for a reviewer to see the flow of thought if they work through a chapter in order. Your notes team may write the notes for chunks in any order they prefer. However, please try to complete all chunks in a chapter whenever possible in order to help the reviewer.


=== Use the Review Checklist ===
