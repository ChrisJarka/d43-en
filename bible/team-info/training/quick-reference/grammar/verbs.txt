====== Verbs ======


===== Description =====

Verbs either link the subject to a descriptive portion of the sentence or express an action or a state-of-being (e.g. am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been). Many languages use more verbs than English does. The portion of the sentence which contains the verb is called the predicate.
