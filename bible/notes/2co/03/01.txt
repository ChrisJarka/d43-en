\v 1 \add As I write these things about myself\add*, I am \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* not \add doing it\add* to boast about how good I am, \add as some of you say I do\add*. Some people always carry letters with them that tell how well they work, \add that other people\add* have \add written\add*. But I do not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* need \add to bring\add* letters like that \add when I come to you\add*. Nor do I need to ask you \add to write\add* letters like that \add for me when I go to other congregations\add*.
\v 2 You yourselves are \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like a\add* letter that recommends my work \add for God to everyone\add*. People see \add how Christ changed\add* your \add lives when you believed the message that I taught you\add*. Everyone \add who knows you\add* can see \add the result of my work for God\add*.
\v 3 You are \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like\add* a letter that Christ himself \add has written\add* that says good things about \add my work for God in your lives\add*. You show \add people by the way you now conduct your lives that God has changed your lives\add* as a result of my work \add among you. People did\add* not \add find out about you by\add* reading \add a letter that was written to them on paper\add* with \add pen and\add* ink. Instead, \add they saw how\add* the Spirit of the all-powerful God \add has changed your lives\add*. Nor \add did people find out about you by reading\add* a letter that was carved on stone slabs \add like the stone slabs that God gave to Moses\add*. Instead, \add it was the change that God's Spirit made in\add* your lives \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that they saw\add*.

\v 1 We are not telling you how much you should trust us. You know us well, and you should trust us because you know us.  A stranger may need to have a letter of recommendation send to you before you would trust them, but you know us and you trust us.
\v 2 You are our "letter of reecommendation"! You have told everyone about how we served you, and our love for you is far has more power than a letter of recommendation. You tell everyone about how much you trust us. The best letter of recommendation is when you introduce us to the people you know.
\v 3 You are like a letters that Christ wrote, letters that we delivered when you trusted Christ and were joined to him. These letters from Christ were not written with pen and ink, but with the Spirit of God; these letters were not written on stone tables, but Christ wrote his letter on your hearts, for others to read when they get to know you. They read what Christ wrote on you.

\v 1 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again ? Surely we do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, as some do?
\v 2 You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, known and read by all people.
\v 3 And you show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.
