\v 13 At that time, Abram was living near the big trees that belonged to Mamre, who belonged to the Amor people-group. Abram had made an agreement with Mamre and his two brothers, Eshcol and Aner, that they would help each other if there was a war.
\v 14 One of the men who escaped from the battle told Abram \add the Hebrew\add* what had happened and that his nephew, Lot, had been captured and taken away. So Abram summoned 318 men who were his servants, men who had been with Abram since they were born. They all went together and pursued their enemies as far as Dan \add city\add*.

\v 13 One who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. He was living by the oaks that belonged to Mamre, the Amorite, who was the brother of Eshcol and Aner, who were all allies of Abram.
\v 14 Now when Abram heard that enemies had captured his relative, he led out his three hundred and eighteen trained men, born in his house, and pursued them as far as Dan.
