Just as there are restrictive and nonrestrictive relative clauses, there are restrictive and nonrestrictive adjectives. Some times people use adjectives to tell which one, and sometimes people use them to tell something about them. 

My eldest sister (“Eldest” tells which one.) 

My elderly father (“Elderly” tells something about my father)
