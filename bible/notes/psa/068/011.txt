\q
\v 11 The Lord gives the word:
\q The women that publish the tidings are a great host.
\q
\v 12 Kings of armies flee, they flee;
\q And she that waits at home divideth the spoil.
\q
\v 13 When you lie among the sheepfolds,
\q It is as the wings of a dove covered with silver,
\q And her pinions with yellow gold.
