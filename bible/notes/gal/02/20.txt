\v 20 It is as though I was with Christ when he was crucified (OR, It is as though my old way of life ended when Christ died on the cross.) No longer am I directing the way I behave as I did before I believed in Christ. Now Christ is directing how I behave. And whatever I do now while I live, I do it trusting in God's Son. He is the one who loved me and offered himself as a sacrifice for me.
\v 21 I am not rejecting as useless what God did for me kindly, as my opponents are doing. I fully accept that God saved me by acting kindly towards me. If it is because people obey the laws that God gave to Moses that God erases the record of their sins, then Christ died for nothing.

\v 20 I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me, and what life I now live in the flesh I live in faith the faith which is in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself up for me.
\v 21 I do not negate the grace of God, for if righteousness is through the law then Christ died for nothing.
