\v 6 \add Timothy, I say these things to\add* you because as for me, \add it is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add they are now about to kill me. It is as though my blood will\add* be poured out \f + \ft Or:they will kill me \f* \add as a sacrifice on the altar\add*; that is, \add I know\add* that it is the time for me to die \f + \ft euphemism \f*.
\v 7 \add And as to telling people the\add* good \add message and defending it\add*, I have exerted myself thoroughly\f + \ft Or: done it with all my energy \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like a boxer does. As to doing\add* the work that God gave me to do, I have completed it, \add like a runner who finishes\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the race. \add As to\add* what we believe, I have been loyal to it\f + \ft Or: continue to believe it \f*.
\v 8 \add So, like people award\add* a prize \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add to the winner of a race\add*, the Lord, who judges rightly, will give me a reward \add because I have lived\add* righteously. He will give me that reward when \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add he judges people\add*. And not only \add will he reward\add* me, but he will also reward all those who very much want him to come back.

\v 6 for I already am being poured out as a sacrificial offering and the time of my departure by death has come.
\v 7 I have fought the good fight; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith.
\v 8 A crown of righteousness is reserved for me. The Lord, the righteous judge, will award it to me in that day, and not to me only, but also to everyone who has come to love his appearing.
