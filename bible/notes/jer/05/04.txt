====== Jeremiah 05:4-6 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 I thought, "\add We cannot expect\add* these people \add to act righteously, because they\add* are poor;
\q2 they do not have any sense.
\q1 They do not know the way Yahweh wants them to conduct their lives;
\q2 they do not know what God requires them to do.
\q1
\v 5 So, I will go and talk to their leaders,
\q2 because they surely know how God wants them to conduct their lives."
\q1 But they also have stopped obeying Yahweh \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\q2 and they will not allow him to lead them.
\q1
\v 6 Because of that, lions will come out of the forests and kill them;
\q2 wolves from the desert will attack them;
\q2 leopards that lurk\f + \ft Or: wait \f* outside their cities will maul anyone who walks outside the cities.
\q1 Those things will happen because the people have sinned very much against God
\q2 and have turned away from him very frequently.

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 So I said, "Surely these are only poor people.
\q They are foolish, for they do not know Yahweh's ways, nor their God's decrees.
\q
\v 5 I will go to the important people and declare God's messages to them, for they at least know Yahweh's ways,
\q the decrees of their God. But they all broke their yoke together; they all tore apart the chains that bound them to God."
\q
\v 6 So a lion from a thicket will attack them. A wolf from the Arabah will ruin them.
\q A lurking panther will come against their cities. Anyone who goes outside his city will be torn apart.
\q For their transgressions increase. Their acts of faithlessness are unlimited.
