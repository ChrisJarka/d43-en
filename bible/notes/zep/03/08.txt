\q1 I have decided to gather the people of the kingdoms of the earth

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Therefore wait for me—this is Yahweh's declaration—until the day that I rise up to seize the prey.
\q For my decision is to assemble the nations, to gather the kingdoms,
\q to pour out on them my anger—all of my burning wrath;
\q for in the fire of my jealousy all the earth will be consumed.  
\f + \ft The Hebrew text as \fqa until the day that I rise up to seize the prey \fqa* . However, some ancient and modern versions have \fqa until the day that I rise up as a witness \fqa* . \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verse 3:8, Yahweh warns that he will judge all nations. 

  * **wait for me ... until the day** - This phrase implies that they are waiting for judgment.
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I rise up to seize the prey** - Yahweh's judgment on the nations is spoken of as if he was an hungry animal that attacked a smaller animal. AT: "I will rise up and destroy them as an animal seizes its prey" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to assemble the nations, to gather the kingdoms** - These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh will judge all of the nations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **my anger—all of my burning wrath** - The words "anger" and "burning wrath" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the intensity of Yahweh's anger. AT: "my very fierce wrath" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **in the fire of my jealousy all the earth will be consumed** - This phrase can be stated in active form. AT: " the fire of my jealousy will devour all the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the fire of my jealousy ... consumed** - Yahweh's jealousy is here spoken of as if it were fire that could consume something. This can be stated as a simile. AT: "my jealousy will consume all the earth as a fire" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
