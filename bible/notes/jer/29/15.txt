\v 15 But since you said Yahweh has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,
\v 16 thus says Yahweh to the king who sits on the throne of David and all the people who abide in that city, your brothers who have not gone out with you into captivity;
\v 17 thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Look! I am sending out the sword, famine, and disease upon them! For I will make them like rotten figs that are too bad to be eaten.
