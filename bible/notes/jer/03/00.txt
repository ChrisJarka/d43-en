====== Jeremiah 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 3:1-5, 12-17, 19-25, which are extended quotations.

The prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 2:1-3:5. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. The same is true for 3:19-4:3. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:reveal]])


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Judah told to repent ==

If Judah repents, God will bring the people back from the captivity into which he is going to send them. In this book, "Israel" serves as another name Judah because the northern kingdom of Israel no longer exists. The people group formed by these ten tribes had been scattered among the other nations by the Assyrians, who had conquered them. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:repent]])

== Adultery ==
Judah's faithlessness to God is often pictured as adultery. This is a common image in Scripture. When Judah does not worship God, their nation is spoken of as if it were a woman unfaithful to her husband. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:adultery]])
