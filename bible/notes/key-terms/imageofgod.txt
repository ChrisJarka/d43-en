====== image of God ======

===== Definition: =====

People were created in the "image of God," which means that man is created in the likeness of God himself. When this phrase is applied to Jesus, it means that he is God himself.

  * There may be several different ways that human beings reflect the "image of God":  physically, emotionally, spiritually, and mentally, including the ability to reason and communicate.
  * In the New Testament, it says that Jesus is the "image of the invisible God" and that he is the "exact representation of his being."
  * Unlike human beings, Jesus was not created in the image of God; rather, he has always been the image of God, which means he is the same essence and being as God.
