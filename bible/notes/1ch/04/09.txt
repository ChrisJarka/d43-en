\v 9 And Jabez was more honorable than his brethren: and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with
sorrow.
\v 10 And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that you would bless me indeed, and enlarge my border, and that your
hand might be with me, and that you would keep me from evil, that it be not to my sorrow! And God granted him that which he
requested.
