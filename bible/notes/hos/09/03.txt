<usfm>
\v 3 They shall not dwell in Jehovahâ€™s land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.
\v 4 They shall not pour out wine-offerings to Jehovah, neither shall they be pleasing to him: their sacrifices
shall be to them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their
appetite; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah.
