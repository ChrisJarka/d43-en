\v 18 Although most of the people who had come from \add the tribes of\add* Ephraim, Manasseh, and Issachar had not purified themselves, they ate the food of the Passover festival anyway, ignoring the rules written \add by Moses\add*. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying "Yahweh, you always do what is good; I pray that you will forgive everyone
\v 19 who sincerely wants to honor you, the God whom our ancestors \add worshiped\add*, even if they have not purified themselves by obeying the sacred laws that you gave to us."
\v 20 And Yahweh heard what Hezekiah prayed; he forgave the people, \add and did not punish them\add*.

\v 18 For a great many of the people, many of them from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover meal, against the written instructions. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, "May the good Yahweh pardon everyone
\v 19 who sets his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his ancestors, even though he is not purified by the purification standards of the holy place."
\v 20 So Yahweh listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.
