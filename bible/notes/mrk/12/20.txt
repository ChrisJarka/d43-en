\v 20 There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife and then he died leaving no offspring.
\v 21 and the second married her and died, leaving no offspring; and the third likewise.
\v 22 and the seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman also died.
\v 23 In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For the seven brothers had her as wife."
