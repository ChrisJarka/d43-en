===== Translation Checking =====

=== Why do we do translation checking? ===


==== Introduction ====

As part of the translation process, it is necessary that several people check the translation in various ways to make sure that it is clearly communicating the message that it should communicate. This is a guide to the process of checking, in the form of a scale with three levels.

This checking scale helps to show the extent to which the accuracy and clarity of a translation have been verified. These checking levels have been developed by the __[[https://unfoldingword.org|unfoldingWord network]]__, the same group that manages Door43 with the help of many volunteers, and they are used to indicate the checking level of all biblical content on Door43.

==== The Checking Levels ====

There are three checking levels: [[:en:ta:check:level1|Checking Level One]], [[:en:ta:check:level2|Checking Level Two]], and [[:en:ta:check:level3|Checking Level Three]]. Any translation that has not yet been checked to Level One is considered to have not been checked and is assigned no checking status.

The purpose of having several Checking Levels is to make translated materials quickly available to the church, while also allowing the content to continue to be checked and corroborated in an open environment. At all times, the degree to which its accuracy has been checked will be clearly indicated. We believe this will result in a faster checking process, allow broad church participation and ownership, and produce better translations.
