\v 8 For those reasons, I beg you to  \add forgive him and accept him into your group again, and thus\add* assure him that you truly love him.
\v 9  \add I feel sure that you will do as I ask\add*, because when I wrote  \add severely\add* to you  \add before\add*, I did it to test you by seeing whether or not you really would do everything  \add that I, as your apostle, asked you to do\add*.

<usfm>
\v 8 It is time to say out loud and to everyone how much you love him, so there is no misunderstanding.
\v 9  I wrote to you about this as a way to test your faith and to see whether you would handle this matter in the way that was good and right. And you did.
