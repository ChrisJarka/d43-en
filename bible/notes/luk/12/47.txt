\v 48 But every \add servant\add* who did not know \add what his master wanted\add* him to do, and who did things for which he deserved to be punished, will be beaten lightly \f + \ft Or:\add the master\add* will beat lightly every \add servant\add* who did not know \add what his master wanted\add* him to do and did the things for which he deserved that \add his master\add* would beat him \f*. \add God will treat his people similarly, because he\add* expects a lot from those people whom \add he\add* has allowed \add to understand a lot\add*. People who entrust things \add to others' care\add* expect those people\add to care for those things\add* very well. Similarly, \add God\add* expects a lot from those people whom he has allowed \add to understand a lot\add*. Furthermore, he expects the most from people to whom he has given the most \add ability\add*."

\v 47 And that servant, having known his lordâ€™s will, and not having prepared or done according to his will, will be beaten with many blows.
\v 48 But he who did not know, and did things worthy of a beating, will be beaten with a few blows. But everyone to whom much is given, much will be required of him, and to whom they entrust much, they will ask even more of him.
