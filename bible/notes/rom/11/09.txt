\v 9 The Jews remind me of what King David said, when he asked God to cause his enemies' senses to be dull:
"Make them stupid, like animals that that fall into nets or traps! May they feel as safe as if they were at their banquets, but let those feasts be times when you will catch them, and they will sin, with the result that you will destroy them.
\q
\v 10 May they not see the danger when it comes to them. May you always make them suffer because of their troubles."

\q
\v 10 Let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see;
\q always keep their backs bent."
