\p
\v 15 Since you said that Yahweh has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,
\v 16 Yahweh says this to the king who sits on the throne of David and to all the people who are staying in that city, your brothers who have not gone out with you into captivity—
\v 17 Yahweh of hosts says this, 'See, I am about to send sword, famine, and disease on them. For I will make them like rotten figs that are too bad to be eaten.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah speaks to the captive Israelites.

  * **the king who sits on the throne of David** - Sitting on the throne is a metonym for ruling as king. AT: "the king who rules the Israelites as David did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Yahweh of hosts says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **See** - This alerts the reader to pay attention to what follows. AT: "Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention" 
  * **I am about to send sword, famine, and disease on them** - The word "sword" is a metonym for war. The sword, famine, and disease are spoken of as people who can obey Yahweh's command to harm the Israelites. AT: "I am going to punish them by having them die in war, from hunger, and from illness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **For I will make them like rotten figs that are too bad to be eaten** - Rotten figs are useless because they cannot be eaten, and Yahweh sees no use for the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
