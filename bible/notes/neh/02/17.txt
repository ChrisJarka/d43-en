\v 17 Then said I to them, You see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and the gates thereof are burned
with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.
\v 18 And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also of the kingâ€™s words that he had spoken to me. And
they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good
work.
