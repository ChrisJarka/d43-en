===== Definition: =====


Grapes are fruit that grow in clusters on vines. Their juice is used in making wine. 

    * People grow grapes in gardens called vineyards.
    * Grapes don't last long after they have become ripe. So people dry them to eat later. In English these dried grapes are called raisins. The Old Testament refers to cakes made of raisins.
    * Some grapes are red, and so is their juice and wine. In the Bible this red wine is sometimes a symbol for blood.
