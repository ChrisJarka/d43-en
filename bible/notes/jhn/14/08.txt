===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Have I been so long with you, and you still do not know me, Philip?** - AT: "I have been with you disciples already for a very long time. You, Philip, should know me by now." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **how can you say, 'Show us the Father'?** - AT: "so you, Philip, really should not be saying, 'Show us the Father.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Lord, show us the Father...Jesus said...Whoever has seen me has seen the Father** - To see God the Son, Jesus, is to see God the Father. God the Father, Son, and Spirit are each God and all of God. To know one person of God is to know them all, yet the persons are not each other. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
