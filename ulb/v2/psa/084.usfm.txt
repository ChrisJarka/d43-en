\c 84
\d For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
\q
\v 1 How amiable are your tabernacles,
\q O Jehovah of hosts!
\q
\v 2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of Jehovah;
\q My heart and my flesh cry out to the living God.
\q
\v 3 Yea, the sparrow has found her a house,
\q And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young,
\q Even your altars, O Jehovah of hosts,
\q My King, and my God.
\q
\v 4 Blessed are they that dwell in your house:
\q They will be still praising thee. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee;
\q In whose heart are the highways to Zion.
\q
\v 6 Passing through the valley of Weeping they make it a place of springs;
\q Yea, the early rain covers it with blessings.
\q
\v 7 They go from strength to strength;
\q Every one of them appears before God in Zion.
\q
\v 8 O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer;
\q Give ear, O God of Jacob. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 9 Behold, O God our shield,
\q And look upon the face of your anointed.
\q
\v 10 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand.
\q I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,
\q Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
\q
\v 11 For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield:
\q Jehovah will give grace and glory;
\q No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
\q
\v 12 O Jehovah of hosts,
\q Blessed is the man that trusts in thee.
