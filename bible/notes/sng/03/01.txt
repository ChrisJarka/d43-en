===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:love]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:beloved]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I was longing for him ... could not find him** - "I had a strong desire to be with him ... loves, but he was not there"
  * **him whom my soul loves** - The soul is a metonym for the whole person. Here it makes a stronger statement of the woman's love for the man than "my beloved" ([[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:14]]). (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **go through the city** - "walk through the city"
  * **through the streets and squares** - The word "squares" indicates the center area of a town where streets or roads come together. It is often an area where people sell items, a market, and a place where people come together to talk.
  * **search** - "to look for"
