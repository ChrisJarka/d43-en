\v 1 Look, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule in justice.
\v 2 A man will be as a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm, like  streams of water in a dry place, like
the shade of a great rock in a parched land.
\v 3 Then the eyes of those who see will not be blurred, and the ears of those who hear will hear attentively.
