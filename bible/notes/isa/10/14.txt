===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **My hand has seized, like from a nest, the wealth of nations- **  Yahweh is still quoting the king of Assyria. The king states "my hand" but is referring to his army. This could be translated as "My army has stolen the wealth from the nations just like taking an egg from a nest." (See: Synecdoche, Simile)
  * **None fluttered their wings or opened their mouth or chirped **- <font 14px line-height: 26.1333332061768px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>This compares a bird sitting quietly, unaware of the danger that is coming, with the people who were taken by surprise by the army of Assyria.  It can be translated as</font> "The people did not protest." (see: Metaphor)
