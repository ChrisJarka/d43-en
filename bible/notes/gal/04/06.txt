\v 6 We are God's children because God sent the Spirit of his Son to lead us by living in each of us. God's Spirit enables us to pray, "Daddy, Father!" This shows that we are God's children.
\v 7 So, because of what God has done, no longer is each of you like a slave. Instead, each of you is a child of God. Since each of you is now God's child, God has also given you all that he has promised in the Scriptures to those who trust in Jesus.

\v 6 Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls, "Abba, Father."
\v 7 For this reason you are no longer a slave but a son, and if you are a son, then you are also an heir through God.
