===== translationNotes: =====

Yahweh is talking about Judah and Israel.

  * **The leaders of Judah are like those who move a boundary stone** - To "move a boundary stone" refers to moving the landmark that marked the border of some property, which was a crime under Israelite law. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **I will pour my wrath on them like water** - Yahweh's wrath against Judah will be like a large stream of water that destroys them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Ephraim is crushed; he is crushed in judgment** - This statement is made twice for emphasis. Here "Ephraim" refers to the people of the northern kingdom of Israel. AT: "I will punish the people of Israel severely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
