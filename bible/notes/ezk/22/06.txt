\v 6 Behold, the princes of Israel, every one according to his power, have been in you to shed blood.
\v 7 In you have they set light by father and mother; in the midst of you have they dealt by oppression with the sojourner;
in you have they wronged the fatherless and the widow.
\v 8 You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my sabbaths.
\v 9 Slanderous men have been in you to shed blood; and in you they have eaten upon the mountains: in the midst of you they
have committed lewdness.
