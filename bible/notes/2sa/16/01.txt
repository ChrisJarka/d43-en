\v 1 And when David was a little past the top of the ascent, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a
couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer
fruits, and a bottle of wine.
\v 2 And the king said to Ziba, What meanest you by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the kingâ€™s household to ride on;
and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.
