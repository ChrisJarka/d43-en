There are different ways that units of measure for distance can be translated:

  - Use a term similar in spelling to the Bible term for that distance unit, followed by the equivalent value using a distance unit that is known to the receptor culture.
  - Directly use the equivalent distance in terms of the distance unit that is known to the receptor culture, without using the Bible name.
