\q
\v 1 I am a rose of Sharon,
\q A lily of the valleys.
\b
\q
\v 2 As a lily among thorns,
\q So is my love among the daughters.
\b
\q
\v 3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,
\q So is my beloved among the sons.
\q I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
\q And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
\q
\v 4 He brought me to the banqueting-house,
\q And his banner over me was love.
\q
\v 5 Stay you me with raisins, refresh me with apples;
\q For I am sick from love.
\q
\v 6 His left hand is under my head,
\q And his right hand does embrace me.
\b
\q
\v 7 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
\q By the roes, or by the hinds of the field,
\q That you stir not up, nor awake my love,
\q Until he please.
\b
\q
\v 8 The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh,
\q Leaping upon the mountains,
\q Skipping upon the hills.
\q
\v 9 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart:
\q Behold, he stands behind our wall;
\q He looks in at the windows;
\q He glanceth through the lattice.
\b
\q
\v 10 My beloved spake, and said to me,
\q Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
\q
\v 11 For, lo, the winter is past;
\q The rain is over and gone;
\q
\v 12 The flowers appear on the earth;
\q The time of the singing of birds is come,
\q And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;
\q
\v 13 The fig tree ripeneth her green figs,
\q And the vines are in blossom;
\q They give forth their fragrance.
\q Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
\q
\v 14 O my dove, that are in the clefts of the rock,
\q In the covert of the steep place,
\q Let me see your countenance,
\q Let me hear your voice;
\q For sweet is your voice, and your countenance is comely.
\b
\q
\v 15 Take us the foxes, the little foxes,
\q That spoil the vineyards;
\q For our vineyards are in blossom.
\q
\v 16 My beloved is mine, and I am his:
\q He feedeth his flock among the lilies.
\q
\v 17 Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away,
\q Turn, my beloved, and be you like a roe or a young hart
\q Upon the mountains of Bether.
