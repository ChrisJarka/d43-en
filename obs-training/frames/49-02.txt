He walked on water, calmed storms, **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:heal|healed]]** many sick people, **drove out [[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:demon|demons]]**, **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:raise|raised]] the [[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:death|dead]] to life**, and turned five loaves of bread and two small fish into enough food for over 5,000 people.
