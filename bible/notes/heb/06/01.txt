\v 1 So, we must not keep discussing what we first learned about Christ. Instead, we must proceed to the teaching that will make us mature believers. We must not be people who always need someone to teach them the elementary truths about Christ that are like a foundation. I am referring to the teaching that people who do sinful things, things that those who are spiritually dead do, must turn away from their sinful behavior. I am referring to the teaching that people must believe in God.
\v 2 I am referring to the teaching about what various Jewish and Christian rituals that accompany baptizing people signify. I am referring to the teaching about how elders enable people to receive spiritual gifts by laying hands on them. I am referring to questions about the details of the teaching that God will cause those who have died to live again. And I am referring to doubts about the teaching that God will judge some people and punish them eternally.
\v 3 Instead of continuing to discuss these elementary truths, we will go on to give people mature teaching, if God allows it.

\v 1 Therefore leaving what we first learned about the message of Christ, we must press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,
\v 2 teaching about baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and  eternal judgment.
\v 3 And this we will we do, if God permits.
