===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 When they arrived there, Samuel looked at \add Jesse's oldest son\add* Eliab, and thought, "Surely this is the one whom Yahweh has appointed \add be king\add*!"
\p
\v 7 But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Do not think \add that he is the one whom I have chosen\add* because of his being handsome and very tall, because I have not chosen him. I do not evaluate people as people do. You people evaluate people by their appearance, but I evaluate people by what is in their inner beings."

\v 6 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovahâ€™s anointed is before him.
\v 7 But Jehovah said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him:
for Jehovah sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looks on the heart.
