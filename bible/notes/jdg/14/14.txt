===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the eater**  - "the one who eats"
  * **the strong, something **- "the strong came something"
  * **his guests** - a guest is someone invited to a celebration. AT: "the men visiting at Samson's feast"
  * The meaning of this riddle should probably not be translated too clearly, since a riddle is supposed to be difficult to understand. However, the riddle means: From out of the eater (the lion) came something to eat (honey). From of out of the strong (the lion) came something sweet (honey). See verse 18 in this chapter for the answer to the riddle.
