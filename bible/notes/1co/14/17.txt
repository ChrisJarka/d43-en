====== 1 Corinthians 14:17-19 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 You may be thanking God very well, but you are not helping them.
\v 18 I thank God that I speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that I have not learned\add* more than any of you do.
\v 19 But during a worship service, \add in order that others will understand what I am saying\add*, I would prefer to speak five words using my mind, in order that I may teach others, rather than to speak ten thousand words in a language \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that is not understood by the congregation\add*.

\v 17 For if you give thanks in your spirit, that is well and good for you, but you are not helping the other believers.
\v 18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than any of you do.
\v 19 But to the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, words with which I can teach others, than say ten thousand words in a strange language.

\v 17 For you certainly give thanks well enough, but the other person is not built up.
\v 18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
\v 19 But in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding so that I might instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **you certainly give** - Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **the other person is not built up** - Building people up represents helping them become mature and strong in their faith. This can be stated in active form. See how you translated "builds up" in [[:en:bible:notes:1co:08:01|8:1]]. AT: "the other person is not strengthened" or "what you say does not strengthen any outsider who might hear you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **than ten thousand words in a tongue** - Paul was not counting words, but used exaggeration to emphasize that a few understandable words is far more valuable than even a great number of words in a language that people cannot understand. AT: "10,000 words" or "a great many words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
