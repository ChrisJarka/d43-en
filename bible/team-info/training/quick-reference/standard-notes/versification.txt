====== Alternate Verses or Versification ======

The IT team will make the right verse show in the GW language, but there is a chance that the MTT might have another version that uses different numbering, or includes different text. We should add a very brief note. Something like:

Some versions place verse x in chapter x. You should number the verses according to the main version that your language group uses.
Verse x is not included in the best manuscripts, but some modern version do include it. If you choose not to include the verse, you may need to add a footnote to explain why it is not present.
