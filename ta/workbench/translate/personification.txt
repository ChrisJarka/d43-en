====== Personification ======

Personification is a figure of speech in which someone speaks of something as if it could do what animals or humans can do.
===== Examples of Personification from the Bible =====

**Does not Wisdom call out? Does not Understanding raise her voice?** Proverbs 8:1  \\ 
The author speaks of wisdom and understanding as if it is a woman who calls out to teach people. 
 
**The wild animals of the field will honor me, the jackals and the ostriches.**  Isaiah 43:20 \\ 
God speaks of animals as if they could honor him by what they do or say. 
 
**Discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you.** Proverbs 2:11 \\ 
The author speaks of discretion and understanding as if they could watch over and guard you. A person who has discretion and understanding will be safe. 

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Use the personification if it would be understood correctly.
  * Use the words “like” or “as” to show that the sentences is not to be understood literally. See the example given below from Genesis 4.
  * If it would not be understood correctly, find a way to translate it without the personification. See the example given below from Matthew 8.
===== Examples of Translation Suggestions =====

**sin crouches at the door** Genesis 4:7 \\ 
God speaks of sin as a wild animal that is waiting for the chance to attack.  This shows how dangerous sin is. It can be translated as "sin is at your door, waiting to attack you" or "sin is about to destroy you, just as a wild animal could harm a person." 
 
**even the winds and the sea obey him**  Matthew 8:27 \\ 
The speakers speak of the wind and the sea as if they are able to hear and respond to Jesus as people do. If this would not be understood correctly it could be translated as "He even controls the winds and the sea."


===== Examples from English =====

**That delicious looking dessert is calling out to me, "Eat me. Eat me."**  This personification helps to show how tempted the speaker feels to eat the cake. It also implies that the responsibility for the speaker's choice to eat the cake belongs to the cake.

**The raging fire devoured everything in its way.**  \\ This description of the fire helps show how terrifying and destructive it was by comparing it to a wild animal that devours other animals.
