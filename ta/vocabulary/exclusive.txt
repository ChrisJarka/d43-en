====== Exclusive ======


**Some languages have two sets of pronouns for we/us/our. The exclusive pronouns refer only to the speaker and at least one other person, but not the person being spoken to. They exclude the person being spoken to.**

The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. Like English, these languages do not have separate exclusive pronouns.


This is not a problem for translators whose language also does not have exclusive pronouns. When a translator sees the word “we,” they can use the word for “we” in their own language.


But translators whose language has separate exclusive pronouns will always have to be careful whenever they read words like “we” “us” and “ours.” in English, Hebrew, or Greek. They will always have to figure out whether they should use the pronoun that includes the person being spoken to or the pronoun that excludes the person being spoken to.


//**Example from English ** // 


    * Ed and I are going out for a walk. Do __you__  want to come with __us__?


//This example uses the word __us__  to refer to a specific group of people not including the person being spoken to.// 


**Examples from the Bible ** 


    * Give __us__  each day the food that __we__  need. Luke 11:3 (TFT)


//When people pray this, they do not include God in the words “us” and “we”. God is not one of the people who need food. So for this verse, languages that have the exclusive forms of “we” and “us” would use the exclusive forms.// 


    * My son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been very worried as we have been searching for you!” Luke 2:48 (TFT)


//In this verse Mary asked Jesus why he had caused them to worry about him. When she said “us” and “we”, she was referring to herself and her husband and possibly others, but she was not referring to Jesus. Languages that have exclusive forms of “we” and “us” would use the exclusive form.// 


    * My noble friend Theophilus, many people saw the things that Jesus did while he was with us, from the time when he started his ministry. Luke 1 1-2 (TFT)


//Luke was writing this letter to Theophilus, a man who most likely had not seen the things that had happened. Here the word “us” probably does not include Theophilus. Languages that have exclusive forms should use the exclusive form for “us” here.// 


    * And as you wish that __others__  would do to you, do so to __them__. Luke 6:31 (ESV)


//This example uses the words __others__  and __them__  which again is referring to specific groups of people but does not include the person being spoken to.//
