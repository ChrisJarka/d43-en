\v 30 But these are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the words in the Scriptures \f + \ft personification \f*: "The son of the \add woman\add* who was not a slave will inherit \add what his father has\add*. The female slave's son will certainly not inherit those things. So send away from \add this place\add* the female slave and her son \f + \ft metaphor \f*!" \add That means that you should certainly expel from your groups those who insist that we obey all the laws God gave Moses\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 31 \add My\add* fellow believers, \add Hagar symbolizes the laws that God gave to Moses. But we are not those who must obey all the laws that God gave to Moses\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add So\add* we are not \add the\add* female slave \add Hagar's spiritual\add* descendants \f + \ft metaphor \f*. But \add Sarah's descendants are those who were born as a result of believing what God promised to Abraham. So we are\add* the \add spiritual\add* descendants of \add Sarah, the woman\add* who was not a slave \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

\v 30 But these are the words in the Scriptures: “The son of the woman who was not a slave will inherit what his father has. The female slave's son will certainly not inherit those things. So send away from this place the female slave and her son!” That means that you should certainly expel from your groups those who insist that we obey all the laws God gave Moses.

\v 31 My fellow believers, Hagar symbolizes the laws that God gave to Moses. But we are not those who must obey all the laws that God gave to Moses. So we are not the female slave Hagar's spiritual descendants. But Sarah's descendants are those who were born as a result of believing what God promised to Abraham. So we are the spiritual descendants of Sarah, the woman who was not a slave.

\v 30 What does the scripture say? "Cast out the servant and her son. For the son of the servant will not inherit with the son of the freewoman."
\v 31 Therefore, brothers, we are not children of a servant but of the freewoman.
