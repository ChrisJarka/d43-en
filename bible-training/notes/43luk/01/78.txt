===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Zechariah continues prophesying to his newborn son.)
    * **because of his tender mercy**  - Another way to translate this phrase would be, "because he is compassionate and merciful to us."
    * **of our God** - Note that throughout these verses "our" and "us" are inclusive. (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive|Inclusive]].)
    * **like the rising sun** - This can also be translated as, "like the sunrise" or, "like the dawn." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile|Simile]].)
    * **He will shine upon** - This is a metaphor that means, "He will give knowledge to." This could also be translated as, "He will give spiritual light to." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]]).
    * **people who sit in darkness** - This is a metaphor that means, "people who do not know the truth". This could also be translated as, "people who live in spiritual darkness" as in the UDB.
    * **and (who sit in) the shadow of death** - This is a metaphor that means, "who are about to die" or, "and who are afraid that they will soon die."
    * **guide** - This is a metaphor for "teach".
    * **our feet**  - This is a synecdoche and refers to the whole person, not just the feet. It could also be translated as, "us." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:synecdoche|Syncdoche]].)
    * **into the path of peace** - This is a metaphor that means, "into a peaceful life" or, "into a life at peace with God." It could also be translated as, "to walk along a path that leads to peace" or, "to live in a way that brings peace with God." Make sure your translation of this fits with how you translate, "our feet."
