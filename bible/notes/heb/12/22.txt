\v 22 Instead, you have come to the presence of God who truly lives in heaven, to the "New Jerusalem." That is like what your ancestors did when they came to worship God on Mount Zion in Israel, upon which the earthly Jerusalem was built. You have come to where there are countless angels who are rejoicing as they have gathered together.
\v 23 You have joined the assembly all the believers who have privileges as firstborn sons, whose names God has written down in heaven. You have come to God, who will judge everyone. You have come to where the spirits of God's people are, people who lived righteously before they died, and whom God has now made perfect in heaven.
\v 24 You have come to Jesus, who arranged a new covenant between us and God by the blood that flowed when he died on the cross. Jesus' blood made it possible for God to forgive us, and his blood is better than was Abel's blood.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer describes what believers in Jesus have received.  The phrase "have come to" refers to a change in relationship with God. This is expressed three times to creat excitement and show how good the promise of forgiveness through Jesus is.  (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

     * **you**  - English does not use formal and informal forms of “you.”   In this verse you is plural and neuter. It refers to all Christians.    (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) 
    * **ten thousands of angels**  - "an uncountable number of angels"
    * **registered in heaven** - A register is a list of names.  This phrase means followers of Jesus have their names included in the list of people who belong in heaven.  (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **you have come ... to the spirits of the righteous** - Followers of Jesus are now part of the great assembly of other followers whose spirits are made righteous.
    * **God the Judge...Jesus, the mediator** - Jesus is like a lawyer in a court showing God the judge how his blood has paid for the forgiveness of people's guilt. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **the sprinkled blood that speaks better than Abel's blood**  - Blood speaking is used to refer to God's knowledge of why a person died.  While Abel's blood refers to the first murder, Jesus' blood refers to his sacrifice that gives all people the ability to be forgiven. AT: "the sprinkled blood that has a better meaning than Abel's blood"  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
