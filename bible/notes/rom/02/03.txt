\v 3 So you who say God should punish others for doing evil deeds although you do evil deeds yourself, you should certainly not think that you yourself will be able to escape from God, when he begins to punish you!
\v 4 And you should not say, "God is acting very tolerantly and patiently toward me, so I do not need to turn away from my sin." You should understand that God is patiently waiting for you to repent from your sins.
