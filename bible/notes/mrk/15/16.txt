===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **"they called together a whole cohort of soldiers"**  - "they called together a large amount of soldiers" or "they called together many soldiers"
  * **They put a purple robe on Jesus- ** This was an act of mockery. Purple is a color attributed to royalty and by clothing him this way they were mocking his title, "King of the Jews."
  * **a crown of thorns- ** Thorns are a sharp barb that comes off from some bushes that are very painful if they come into contact with one's body.
  * **They began to salute him and said, "Hail, King of the Jews!"**  - Again, the soldiers were mocking Jesus because they did not believe that he was the King of the Jews.
