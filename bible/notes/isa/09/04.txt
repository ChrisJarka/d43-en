===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For the yoke of his burden, the beam across his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor is shattered** - These phrases suggest the Israelites' life of slavery and suffering under oppressors.  A "beam across his shoulder" is a yoke, and all three phrases express the same meaning. (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]] and  [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]]) The word "his" refers to the people of Judah. Alternate translation: "The Lord has broken into pieces the yoke of their burden, the beam across their shoulders, and the rod of their oppressors." Note the shift to "us" and "our" in the UDB. (See [[en:ta:translate:123person]])
  * **as on the day of Midian** - Gideon, a judge in Israel, had defeated the people of Midian, taking many possessions from the destroyed region.  (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]])
  * **every boot treading in the tumult and the garments rolled in blood** - "every boot marching in warfare and clothing covered with blood" (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **will be burned, fuel for the fire** - "will burn as fuel for a fire" (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]] and [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
