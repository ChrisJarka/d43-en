====== Euphemism ======

A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant, embarrassing or considered to be socially unacceptable. Its purpose is to avoid offending the people who hear or read it.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Use the euphemism that is used in the original if people would understand it.
  * Use a euphemism from your own culture.
  * State the information plainly without a euphemism if it would not be offensive.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**But we don’t want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have __fallen asleep__, so that you don’t grieve like the rest, who have no hope.** 1 Thes 4:13 (WEB)\\ 
“Fallen asleep” is a euphemism for “died.” Sometimes people don't like to speak directly about death because it is unpleasant. 


**He came to the sheep pens by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to __cover his feet__.** 1 Samuel 24:3\\
"Cover his feet" is a euphemism for "defecate." English uses the euphemism "relieve himself." Sometimes people don't like to speak directly of things coming from the body.

===== Examples from English =====

**He passed away** and **He departed** mean “He died.”\\
**He slept with her** usually means “They had sexual relations with each other.”\\
**Bathroom** and **restroom** refer to a room that has a toilet in it.
