===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him.

  * **He who **- This can also be translated "Whoever" or "The one who" or "Anyone who" (see UDB).
  * **loves **- The word for "love" here refers to “brotherly love” or “love from a friend.” It can also be translated "cares for" or "is devoted to."
  * **me**  - The pronoun "me" in these verses refers to Jesus.
  * **is not worthy of me **- This can also be translated "does not deserve to belong to me" or "is not worthy to be my disciple" (see UDB).
  * **He who does not pick up his cross and follow after me **- This is a metaphor (See: Metaphor). When a person picks up his cross, that person is willing to follow Jesus even to the point of being killed as Jesus was killed (see UDB).
  * **pick up**  - "take up"
  * **He who finds his life will lose it**  - The meaning here is that if a person is not willing to give up his physical life for Jesus' sake, he will not gain eternal life.
  * **finds his life **- “saves his life” or "keeps his life"
  * **loses his life**  - "gives up his life"
  * **for my sake**  - “because he follows me” or “on my account" or "because of me"
