====== 2 Samuel 20 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Sheba's revolt ==
A man named Sheba told the people of the ten tribes that David was Judah's king, not their king. David sent Amasa to gather the army of Judah to fight against Sheba. Amasa took longer to gather the army; so David sent Joab and the rest of the army to catch Sheba before he was able to amass an army. When Amasa came back with the army, Joab pretended to greet Amasa but instead stabbed him to death. 

== Sheba in the city of Able ==
Sheba hid in the city of Able and Joab was beginning to attack Able. An old woman talked to him and agreed to cut off Sheba's head and throw it over the wall to Joab.  Then Joab left Able.  


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Idiom ==
Joab used an [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]  "has lifted up his hand against the king, against David" meaning revolted against David, to explain why his army was attacking the city of Able.
