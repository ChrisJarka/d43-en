**What is Deuteronomy about?**\\

This book records the renewal of the [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenant]] with Moses and reminds the Israelites of what God had done for them and what he expected from them. He warned them against idolatry and the danger of abandoning their faith in Yahweh.  Yahweh promised judgment on those who disobeyed, and blessings on those who obey his Law. 

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
These titles often describe the author or audience of the biblical book. Many books summarize the contents of the book. It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or to follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]). The name “Deuteronomy” means “Second Law” because this is the second time Moses was records the law. 

**Who wrote Deuteronomy?**\\

The Bible tells us that Moses composed the book of Deuteronomy. The writers of both the Old and New Testament confirm his part in the composition of the book of Deuteronomy. However, it is widely assumed that Joshua wrote chapter 34 and the matters dealing with Moses’ death or events occurring after it.

**What are the important narrative features of Deuteronomy?**\\ 

The book contains a series of Moses's speeches to Israel as they prepare to live in the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]] without Him.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**Does Deuteronomy give instructions for a "holy war?" (Deuteronomy 7,20)**\\ Reword 
In preparation of the conquest of the Promised Land, God gave specific instructions to completely or "utterly destroy" the people and livestock of the peoples they conquered in Canaan. God used the Israelites to punish the Canaanites. Therefore, the conquest of the Promised Land can be seen as God's war. In Deuteronomy, holy war is not glorified rather it is seen as a last resort and to be done humanely.

**Were the religious laws in Deuteronomy different than the laws put in place by the government?**\\
Because God was the true leader of Israel, these laws applied to all of Israel and could be enforced by the government. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**Why does the author frequently use the word "today?"**\\
The author repeatedly uses the word "today" (ULB), while some English translations use "this day." This gives the reader the impression that these speeches were all given on the same day. This may have caused the reader to view this as Moses's will.

**What is the role of God's [[:en:obe:kt:name|name]] in Deuteronomy?**\\
God's name is mentioned over 30 times in the book of Deuteronomy. While there are many ways to understand this [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|metonomy]], it commonly references God's reputation or fame. In Deuteronomy, it is often part of a construction indicating a place where God's name will [[:en:obe:kt:life|live]] or be placed.  This is a reference to Jerusalem and likely references Israel's role in bringing the knowledge of Yahweh to the world.

**Can this book be translated before the rest of the Pentateuch?**\\
It is not recommended to translated this book before the other books of the Pentateuch. This book will not be understood without the context provided by these books.
