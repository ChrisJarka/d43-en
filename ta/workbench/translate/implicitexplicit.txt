This module answers the question: What do the words explicit and implicit mean?\\

There are two different forms of written and spoken communication, explicit and implicit. When a speaker or writer, has a message to give, he has to consider what information to include and what to leave out.

  * Explicit information is what the speaker states clearly.
  * Implicit information is information that the speaker or writer expects his audience to already know, and so he does not include it.


===== Description =====

When a writer writes, he has in mind a certain audience who will read what he writes. The writer has a good idea of what this audience does and does not know about what he is writing about, and so the writer chooses to include the important information that he knows his audience does not know. He chooses to not include the information that his audience already knows.

**this womanâ€™s son died in the night, because __she lay on him__** (1 Kings 3:19)\\
The speaker here believes that her hearers will understand what she means without her having to state clearly that son died because he could not breathe.

**Reason this is a translation issue**\\
Readers may not know information that the original speaker and hearers knew.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**it will be more tolerable for __Tyre and Sidon__ at the day of judgment than for you** (Mattew 11:22)\\
The speaker, Jesus, knows that his hearers know that God destroyed Tyre and Sidon because of their wickedness.

**Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not wash their hands when they eat__.** (Mattew 15:2)\\
The speaker, one of the Pharisees, knows that Jesus knows that the washing is part of a ceremony, not part of physical cleanliness.

**Jesus said to him, "Foxes __have holes__, and the birds __of the sky__ __have nests__, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."** (Matthew 8:20)\\
Jesus adds "of the sky" to "birds," which sounds natural in his language, but may be unnecessary and therefore sound unnatural in another language. He also does not tell what it is that foxes use holes and birds use nests for, but some languages might sound unnatural unless that information is stated.

===== Translation Strategies =====

If leaving the implied information out or leaving unnecessary information in would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider doing so. If not, here are other options:
  - Add in the implied information.
  - Delete information that is unnatural because it is unnecessary.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Add in the implied information.
  * **it will be more tolerable for __Tyre and Sidon__ at the day of judgment than for you** (Mattew 11:22)
    * "God will punish __Tyre and Sidon, cities whose people you think of as very wicked,__ less severely than he will punish you"
  * **Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not wash their hands__ when they eat.** (Mattew 15:2)
    * "Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not go through the ceremonial handwashing ritual__ when they eat."
  * **Jesus said to him, "Foxes __have holes__, and the birds of the sky __have nests__, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."** (Matthew 8:20)
    * "Jesus said to him, 'Foxes __have holes to live in__, and the birds of the sky __have nests to live in__, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.'"

2. Delete information that is unnatural because it is unnecessary.
  * **Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and the birds __of the sky__ have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."** (Matthew 8:20)
    * "Jesus said to him, 'Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.'"
