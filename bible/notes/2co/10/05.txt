====== 2 Corinthians 10:5-6 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 \add Specifically\add*, I show that the \add human\add* arguments that they use to deceive \add people are completely wrong\add*. When they \add proudly say things that\add* keep other people from knowing God, \add I show them that they are completely wrong. I also enable people to\add* change their ways of thinking so that they think about everything as Christ \add wants them to think\add*.
\v 6 I am also ready to discipline everyone \add among you\add* who has not obeyed \add the things that Christ taught. I will do this\add* as soon as you \add who truly want to obey Christ show me that\add* you are \add going to\add* obey him completely.

<usfm>
\v 5 In this way we can prove wrong everyone who proudly speaks against God in order to keep others from knowing him. We can also change how people think, so that they begin to obey Christ.
\v 6 When we see that you are completely obeying Christ yourselves, we will be ready to punish any who remain disobedient to him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 We also destroy every high thing that rises up against the knowledge of God. We take every thought captive into obedience to Christ.
\v 6 And we are getting ready to punish every act of disobedience, as soon as your obedience is complete.
