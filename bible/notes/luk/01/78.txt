====== Luke 01:78-79 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 78 Our God will do that because he is very kind to us.
\q1 Just like a new day begins when the sun rises \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\q1 God will do that new thing for us when the Messiah comes to us from heaven.
\q1
\v 79 People who do not know God \f + \ft metaphor \f* are like those who sit in the darkness.
\q1 They are afraid \f + \ft metonymy \f* that they will soon die.
\q1 But when the Messiah tells us God's message,
\q1 it will be like causing such people to see a bright light.
\q1 He will guide us \f + \ft synecdoche \f* so that we will be living peacefully.

<usfm>
\q
\v 78 This will happen because of the tender mercy of our God, 
\q because of which the sunrise from on high will come to help us,
\q
\v 79 to shine on those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death.
\q He will do this to guide our feet into the path of peace."

  * [[:en:obe:kt:darkness]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:death]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:peace]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **because of the tender mercy of our God** - It might be helpful to state that God's mercy helps people. AT: "because God is compassionate and merciful to us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the sunrise from on high ... to shine on** - Light is often a metaphor for truth. Here, the spiritual truth the Savior will provide is spoken of as if it is a sunrise that lights up the earth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **shine on** - "give knowledge to" or "give spiritual light to"
  * **those who sit in darkness** - Darkness is here a metaphor for the absence of spiritual truth. Here, people who lack spiritual truth are spoken of as if they are sitting in darkness. AT: "people who do not know the truth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **darkness ... shadow of death** - These two phrases work together to emphasize the deep spiritual darkness of people before God shows them mercy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) 
  * **in the shadow of death** - The shadow often represents something that is about to happen. Here, it refers to approaching death. AT: "who are about to die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **guide our feet into the path of peace** - Here "guide" is a metaphor for teaching, and "path of peace" is a metaphor for living at peace with God. The phrase "our feet" is a synecdoche that represents the whole person. AT: "teach us how to live at peace with God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
