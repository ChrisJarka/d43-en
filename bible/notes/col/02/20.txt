====== Colossians 02:20-23 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 \add It is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* you died with Christ. So \add you no longer have to obey\add* elementary regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* \add that are concerned merely with what is external\f + \ft Or: physical \f*, just like a dead person no longer has to do anything\add*. So, do not submit to regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f*
\v 21 such as 'Do not handle \add certain things\add*,' 'Do not taste \add certain things\add*,' 'Do not touch \add certain things\add*,' as if you still had to obey such regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f*.
\v 22 All those things are intended to cease to exist when we use them. \add And do not submit to such regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f*\add*, because they are what mere human teachers command and teach.
\v 23 \add Do not obey such\add* regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* because they only cause people to do what their self-directed nature wants to do. \add Those regulations\add* seem to be wise because they \add urge people to\add* worship as mere human teachers have decided. \add They urge\add* that \add people\add* should humiliate themselves, and that \add people\add* should treat their bodies harshly. But those regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* do not help \add people\add* at all to not do the sinful things that their self-directed nature wants to do.

\v 20 It is as though you died with Christ. So you are now free from the spirits and the "gods" and the religious regulations of this sinful world. Why are you still living as if the world's false beliefs are real, and submitting to the false rules that are found in those religions?
\v 21 These rules are such as: "Do not handle certain things. Do not taste certain things. Do not touch certain things," as if you still had to obey such regulations.
\v 22 Such things and their rules of usage crumble and change and eventually go away. Such commands and teachings are from people, not God.
\v 23 These rules have the "wisdom" of man-made religion and false humility and treating the body severely for religious purposes. Such rules have no real value in controlling our sinful desires.

\p
\v 20 If you died together with Christ to the sinful belief systems of the world, why do you live in submission to the world's beliefs:
\v 21 "Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch"?
\v 22 These are the commandments and teachings of people about things that all perish with use.
\v 23 These rules have the "wisdom" of man-made religion and false humility and ascetic treatment of the body, but have no value against the indulgence of the flesh.
