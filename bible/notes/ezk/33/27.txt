\v 28 I will cause your country to become a desolate wasteland. You will no longer be proud of being a strong country. The mountains of Israel will become very desolate, with the result that no one will walk across them.
\v 29 Then, when I have caused your country to become a desolate wasteland because of all the detestable things that you have done, you will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.'

\v 27 Thus shall you say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely they that are in the waste places shall
fall by the sword; and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured; and they that are in the
strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.
\v 28 And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment; and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains of
Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.
\v 29 Then shall they know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their
abominations which they have committed.
