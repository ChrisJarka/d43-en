\v 12 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 13 "Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a sin so that I reach out with my hand against it and break the
staff of its bread, and send out over it a famine and cut off both man and beast from the land;
\v 14 then even if  these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were in the land's midst, they could only rescue their own selves by their
righteousness." This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.
