**General Information:** - Jeremiah often wrote prophecy in the form of poetry. Hebrew poetry uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **We have heard ... peace** - One possible meaning is that these are the words of Yahweh referring to himself as "we" AT: "I have heard ... peace" (see UDB) Another possible meaning is that these are the words of the people of Jerusalem. AT: "You people of Jerusalem say, 'We have heard ... peace.'"
  * **a trembling voice of dread and not of peace** - Possible meanings are 1) "people cry out in dread because there is no peace" or 2) "you cry out in dread because there is no peace."
