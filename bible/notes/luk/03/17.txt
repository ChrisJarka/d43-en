===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (John continues teaching about the Christ.)
    * **His winnowing fork is in his hand** - This metaphor could also be translated as a simile. "The Christ is like a man whose winnowing fork is in his hand." John was comparing how the Christ would separate the righteous people from the unrighteous people to how a man separates wheat grain from chaff. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|metaphor]], [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile|simile]]). This can also be translated as  "He is holding a winnowing fork because he is ready."
    * **winnowing fork**  - This is a tool used to toss freshly-picked wheat up into the air to separate the grain (seed) from the unwanted seed casings. The heavier seed would fall back down and the unwanted parts would be blown away by the wind.
    * **threshing floor**  - This is a place where the grain (seed) is separated from the chaff (unwanted casing of the seed).
    * **wheat**- This is a grain used to make bread.
    * **storehouse**  - This is where the grain would be kept safe in order to be used later. It can also be translated as, "barn" or, "granary."
    * **burn up the chaff**  - When the grain (seed) is separated from the chaff (unwanted casings), then the grain is stored away for later use. The chaff isn't useful for anything, and so it was burned and destroyed.
