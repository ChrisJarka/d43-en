\v 20 When your son asks you in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah our God has commanded you?
\v 21 then you shall say to your son, We were Pharaohâ€™s bondmen in Egypt: and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;
\v 22 and Jehovah showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes;
\v 23 and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware to our fathers.
