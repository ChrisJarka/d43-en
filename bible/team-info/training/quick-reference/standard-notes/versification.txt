====== Alternate Verses or Versification ======

The IT team will make the right verse show in the GW language, but there is a chance that the MTT might have another version that uses different numbering or includes different text. We should add a very brief note. Something like:

Some versions place verse x in chapter x. You should number the verses according to the main version that your language group uses. \\ 

Verse x is not included in the best manuscripts, but some modern version do include it. If you choose not to include the verse, you may need to add a footnote to explain why it is not present.

===== Examples =====

From Genesis 31:54
  * **Verse 55** - This verse in the ancient Greek translation is verse 32:1 in the Hebrew text. Please follow the national language Bible.

From Acts 8:36
  * **verse 37** - This verse was omitted because some of the older, more reliable, ancient texts did not include it. (See: Original Manuscripts)
