\v 13 Harness the chariot to the team of horses, inhabitants of Lachish.
\q You, Lachish, were the beginning of sin for the daughter of Zion,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Lachish** - The name "Lachish" sounds like "to the chariots" in Hebrew. The people are hitching their chariots to flee, not fight. Lachish was the most important city after Jerusalem in Judah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **the daughter of Zion** - The word "daughter" is a metonym for the people of the city. AT: "the people of Zion" or "the people who live in Zion" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for the transgressions of Israel were found in you** - This idiom can be translated in active form. AT: "for you disobeyed like the people of Israel did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Moresheth Gath** - You may want to add a footnote saying "The name 'Moresheth' means 'to depart.' It is also similar in sound to the word for 'fianc√©e.'" In this metaphor, Moresheth is the bride that Assyria takes, and the "parting gift" is the dowry, the gift her family gives for her to take into the marriage. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Akzib** - You may want to add a footnote saying "The name of this town sounds almost the same as the Hebrew expression for 'deceitful thing.'"
