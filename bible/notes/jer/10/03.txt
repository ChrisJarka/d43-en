<usfm>
\v 3 For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman
with the axe.
\v 4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
\v 5 They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid
of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.
