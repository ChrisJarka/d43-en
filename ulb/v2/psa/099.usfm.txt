\v 1 Jehovah reigneth; let the peoples tremble:
\q He sits above the cherubim; let the earth be moved.
\q
\v 2 Jehovah is great in Zion;
\q And he is high above all the peoples.
\q
\v 3 Let them praise your great and terrible name:
\q Holy is he.
\b
\q
\v 4 The kingâ€™s strength also loves justice;
\q You do establish equity;
\q You executest justice and righteousness in Jacob.
\q
\v 5 Exalt you Jehovah our God,
\q And worship at his footstool:
\q Holy is he.

\q
\v 6 Moses and Aaron among his priests,
\q And Samuel among them that call upon his name;
\q They called upon Jehovah, and he answered them.
\q
\v 7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud:
\q They kept his testimonies,
\q And the statute that he gave them.
\q
\v 8 You answeredst them, O Jehovah our God:
\q You was a God that forgave them,
\q Though you took vengeance of their doings.
\q
\v 9 Exalt you Jehovah our God,
\q And worship at his holy hill;
\q For Jehovah our God is holy.
