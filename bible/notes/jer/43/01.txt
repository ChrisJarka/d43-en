\c 43
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Jehovah their
God, wherewith Jehovah their God had sent him to them, even all these words,
\v 2 then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, You
speak falsely: Jehovah our God has not sent you to say, You shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there;
\v 3 but Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put
us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.
