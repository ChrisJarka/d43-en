\v 50 I am not trying to honor myself. There is someone else who desires \add to honor me\add*, and he is the one who will judge \add whether it is I who am telling the truth or whether it is you who are telling the truth\add*.
\v 51 But the truth is that anyone who obeys what I say will never die!"

<usfm>
\v 50 I do not promote my own accomplishments or praise myself. There is someone else who desires to give me what I deserve, and he is the one who will judge everything  that I say, and all that I do.
\v 51 I promise that what I say is true:  If anyone holds firm to my word and trusts in it as I gave it, that person will never even taste death!"
