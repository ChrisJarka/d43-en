\v 15 Will the axe boast itself against the one who weilds it? Will the saw magnify itself over the one who cuts with it,
as if a rod could lift them that lift it up, so as if a staff could lift something up by itself,
one who is not wood.
\v 16 Therefore the Lord God of armies will send among his elite warriers  emaciation;,and under his glory there will be kindled a
a burning like fire.
