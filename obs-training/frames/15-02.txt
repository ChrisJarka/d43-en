====== Crossing the Jordan River [15-02] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-15-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The **[[:en:obe:other:israel|Israelites]]** had to cross the **[[:en:obe:other:jordanriver|Jordan River]]** to enter into the **[[:en:obe:kt:promised-land|Promised Land]]**. **[[:en:obe:kt:god|God]]** told **[[:en:obe:other:joshua|Joshua]]**, “**Have the [[:en:obe:kt:priest|priests]] go first**.” When the priests started to step into the Jordan River, **the water upstream stopped flowing** so the Israelites could cross over to the other side of the river on dry ground.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Have the priests go first** – For some languages it may be helpful to add, “Have the priests go before the rest of the people to cross the river.” 
  * **the water upstream stopped flowing** — In some languages it may be helpful to add, “and the water in front of them flowed away downstream.”
