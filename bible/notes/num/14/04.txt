===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They said to each another** - This refers to the people of Israel.
  * **lay face down** - This indicates that Moses and Aaron are humbling themselves before God. They were praying to Yahweh and fearful that he may punish the people for rebelling against Yahweh and his chosen leaders. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
