\v 23 We must unwaveringly keep professing what we believe. Since God faithfully does all he promised to do, we must confidently expect him to fulfill his promises.
\v 24 and let us consider how each of us can stimulate each other to love one another and to do good deeds.
\v 25 We must not cease assembling ourselves to worship the Lord, as some people have done. Instead, each one of us must encourage the others. Let us do that all the more since we know that the day that the Lord will return is near.

\v 23 Let us also hold tightly the confession of our confident expectation, without wavering, because God who has promised is faithful,
\v 24 and let us consider how to motivate one another to love and good deeds,
\v 25 not neglecting our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but instead encouraging one another more and more as you see the day drawing near.
