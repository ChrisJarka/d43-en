\v 21 I warned them, "It is useless \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* for you to stay here outside the walls \add on Friday night\add*! If you do this again, I will clobber [IDI] you!" So after that, they did not come on Sabbath days.
\v 22 I also commanded the descendants of Levi to \add perform the ritual to\add* purify themselves and to guard the city gates, to make sure that the Sabbath was kept holy \add by not allowing merchants to enter it on Sabbath days\add*.
\p My God, do not forget this also that I \add have done for you\add*! And because of your faithfully loving me, allow me to continue to live \add many more years\add*!

\v 21 Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge you about the wall? if you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.
\v 22 And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember to me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your lovingkindness.
