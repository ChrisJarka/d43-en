<usfm>
\v 37 And what you sow is not the body that will be, but a bare seed--it may become wheat, or something else.
\v 38 But God gives it a body as he chose, and to each seed its own  body.
\v 39 All not all flesh is the same, but there is one flesh of human beings, and another flesh for animals, and another flesh for birds, and another for fish.
