====== General notes about Matthew 11 ======


**Formatting in this chapter**\\

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of verses 10 and 17, which is are quotations from the Old Testament.

Some scholars believe that verse 20 begins a new stage in the ministry of Christ because of Israel's rejection of him. A new section title is suggested here.
