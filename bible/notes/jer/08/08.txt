<usfm>
\p
\v 8 How do you say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes has wrought
falsely.
\v 9 The wise men are put to shame, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of Jehovah; and what manner of
wisdom is in them?
\v 10 Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to them that shall possess them: for every one from the
least even to the greatest is given to covetousness; from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.
