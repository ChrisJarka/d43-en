\v 17 And they shall take up a lamentation over thee, and say to thee, How are you destroyed, that was inhabited by seafaring
men, the renowned city, that was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, that caused their terror to be on all that lived
there!
\v 18 Now shall the isles tremble in the day of your fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at your
departure.
