===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Suffer hardship with me**  - Possible meanings are 1) "endure suffering as I do." (see UDB) or 2) "share in my suffering."
  * **No soldier serves â€¦ competes by the rules**  - Paul gives Timothy three metaphors in verses 4, 5 and 6 to explain how he should serve Christ. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **No soldier serves while entangled in the affairs of this life**  - "No soldier should be distracted while he is serving by the everyday business of this life." This metaphor compares a servant of Christ to the way a good soldier focuses on his task and does not allow other things to distract him. 
  * **entangled**  - Within the larger metaphor of a soldier is this smaller metaphor that compares the ordinary events of our lives to a trap or a net that captures an animal.
  * **superior officer**  - "the one who enlisted him as a soldier"
  * **competes as an athlete** - This is the second larger metaphor that compares a servant to Christ to an athlete who obeys the rules of the contest.
  * **he is not crowned**  - "he does not win the prize"
  * **competes by the rules**  - "strictly obeys the rules" or "strictly competes according to the rules"
