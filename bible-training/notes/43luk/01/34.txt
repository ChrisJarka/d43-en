===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **How will this happen** - This can also be translated as, "How is this possible?" or, "I do not understand how this is possible."
    * **come over you** - This can also be translated as "will come to you" or "will come down to you." This phrase and the next one are ways of saying that the Holy Spirit would supernaturally cause Mary to become pregnant even while she still remained a virgin. Make sure it is clear that there was no physical union involved; this was a miracle.
    * **The power of the Most High One will overshadow you**  - This could also be translated as "The Power of the Most High One will cover you like a shadow" or, "The Power of the Most High One will be with you" or, "The Most High One will cause this to happen by his power." Again, make sure this does not imply any physical union.
    * **will be called**  - This could also be translated as "people will call him" or, "people will acknowledge that he is."
