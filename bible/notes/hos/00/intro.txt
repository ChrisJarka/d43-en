===What is Hosea===

Hosea lived and ministered in the northern kingdom of Israel, which he often calls Ephraim, just before they were conquered by Assyria. Hosea begins with the events of about 753 BC, just before the death of Jeroboam II. Chapter 7 appears to be directed to King Manahem, who ruled 752- 742 BC. Chapter 7 seems to be written at a time some 10 years later, indicated by Hosea denouncing the policies of King Hoshea of Israel, 723-723 BC and his scandalous treaties with Egypt. The challenges and burdens that Hosea was instructed to endure were unlike any burden or call of any other prophet in the Bible. Hosea was told by Yahweh to marry and to care for a prostitute. Her name was Gomer, which means “Completed,” this implies that she was completed in her rebellion and in her adulteries (there was no more that she could have done). But Hosea was care for her even when she is unfaithful to him. Hosea was to do this so that he might address in his prophecies and by his actions, almost a parable but lived out in the prophet’s life, the relationship that Yahweh had Israel and her idolatries (which was a kind of spiritual “adultery”).



===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Hosea" may also be called the "The book about Hosea" or "The sayings of Hosea."

===Who wrote Hosea?===
Hosea, son of Beeri wrote this book.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

===Why did God command Hosea to marry a prostitute?===
Hosea's marriage to the prostitute Gomer is a type of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] for the kingdom of Israel. This reveals that Israel has been [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful|unfaithful]] to Yahweh and has broken the [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|coveant]] with him in the way an adulterous wife is unfaithful and breaks the covenant with her husband.

===What is a lawsuit?===
Many cultures have a process for resolving disputes through the use of courts. These legal disputes are called lawsuits. Part of Hosea follows the form of a lawsuit. There is a problem that is identified (4:1), someone is accused (4:4), someone is found guilty (4:15) and there is judgment (5:1).

===What was the religious environment in the kingdom of Israel?===
While Israel was supposed to worship Yahweh alone, they combined the worship of Yahweh with the worship of the Canaanite [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]]. The god Baal was prominent in the time of Hosea. This was the cause of God's judgment upon the kingdom of Israel.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

===What does the phrase "the declaration of Yahweh" mean?===

The prophet uses the phrase “the declaration of Yahweh” to introduce a prophetic passage.

===Why are English translations of Hosea very different?===

Hosea 4-14 has many difficult translation issues. Some have compared the difficulties with this section of Hosea with those that are found in the book of Job. Some phrases in Hosea are beyond the current understanding we have of the language. The English translations will often give several alternative translations for these difficult sections. Hosea uses many legal terms. He does not follow the pattern of or prophets in the identifying different kinds of prophetic oracles. The shift between the first person and the third person in Hosea shows almost a merging of the words of the prophet with the words of Yahweh.

===What does the term Israel mean in Hosea?===
In Hosea, "Israel" is only used in reference to the northern kingdom of [[:en:obe:other:kingdomofisrael|Israel]] and is not used in reference to the nation of [[:en:obe:other:israel|Israel]] as a whole.
