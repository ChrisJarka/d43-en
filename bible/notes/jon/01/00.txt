====== Jonah 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Unlike most of the other prophets in the Old Testament, the Book of Jonah is not written in poetry with oracles about the divided kingdom or some enemy of Israel. Jonah was written as a narrative with chapter two dedicated to Jonah's prayer from the belly of the fish. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

In verses 17, there is the mention of "a great fish". It is hard to imagine a sea creature big enough to swallow a man whole and that he survived three whole days and nights there too. But as many scholars have noted, this is a miracle and that is the nature of this account. Trying to explain a miracle causes it to cease being a miracle. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

There is irony expressed in this chapter. Jonah is a prophet of God and should endeavor to do God's will. Instead he is running away from God. Whereas the Gentile sailors are not Israelites but they act out of faith and fear of Yahweh when sending Jonah to a "certain death" by throwing him overboard. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===
