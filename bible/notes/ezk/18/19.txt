\v 19 But you say “Why does the son not lift up the iniquity of his father?” Because the son performs justice and righteousness and keeps all my statutes 
and he does them. He will certainly live!
\v 20 The one who sins: he will die. A son will not lift up a fathers iniquity, and a father will not lift up a son’s iniquity. The righteousness of the one doing rightly 
will be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon him.
