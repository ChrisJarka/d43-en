===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **then he said - **  that is, then Jesus said.
    * **a certain man**  - literally, "some person."
    * **Father give me now the money I am due to inherit**  - Inheritance was only passed on after the father had died. This blatant request not only signifies the son's disrespect for his father, but the son wants to live his life as if his father were already dead.
    * **give**  - The son commands the father.
    * **the money I am due to inherit**  - that is the portion of the property which will be handed down to the youngest son when his father dies.
    * **and he divided his wealth**  - "he" being the father.
    * **wealth**  - literally, "his life" meaning all of the possessions the father had acquired in his lifetime, all that he had to live on.
    * **them**  - that is between the older and younger sons.
