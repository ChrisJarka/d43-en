\c 5

\v 1 After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.
\v 3 In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt,
withered\f + Many ancient authorities insert, wholly or in part,
\fqa waiting for the moving of the water.\f*.
\v 4 \f + Many ancient authorities insert, wholly or in part, \fqa for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into
the pool, and troubled the water: whoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole, with
whatever disease he was holden.\f*
\v 5 And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity.
\v 6 When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time
in that case, he says to him, Wouldest you be made whole?
\v 7 The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming,
another steppeth down before me.
\v 8 Jesus says to him, Arise, take up your bed, and walk.
\v 9 And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked.
\p Now it was the sabbath on that day.
\v 10 So the Jews said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.
\v 11 But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said to me, Take up your bed, and walk.
\v 12 They asked him, Who is the man that said to thee, Take up
your bed, and walk?
\v 13 But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.
\v 14 Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse
thing befall thee.
\v 15 The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.
\v 16 And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.
\v 17 But Jesus answered them, My Father works even until now, and I work.
\v 18 For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God
his own Father, making himself equal with God.
\p
\v 19 Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what
he sees the Father doing: for what things soever he does, these the Son also does in like manner.
\v 20 For the Father loves the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show
him, that you may marvel.
\v 21 For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he will.
\v 22 For neither does the Father judge any man, but he has given all judgment to the Son;
\v 23 that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent
him.
\v 24 Verily, verily, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes him that sent me, has eternal life, and comes
not into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
\v 25 Verily, verily, I say to you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and
they that hear shall live.
\v 26 For as the Father has life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself:
\v 27 and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.
\v 28 Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,
\v 29 and shall come forth; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the
resurrection of judgment.
\p
\v 30 I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the
will of him that sent me.
\v 31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
\v 32 It is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
\v 33 You have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.
\v 34 But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that you may be saved.
\v 35 He was the lamp that burns and shineth; and you were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.
\v 36 But the witness which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to
accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.
\v 37 And the Father that sent me, he has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
\v 38 And you have not his word living in you: for whom he sent, him you believe not.
\v 39 You search the scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of
me;
\v 40 and you will not come to me, that you may have life.
\v 41 I receive not glory from men.
\v 42 But I know you, that you have not the love of God in yourselves.
\v 43 I am come in my Fatherâ€™s name, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.
\v 44 How can you believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that
comes from the only God you seek not?
\v 45 Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you,
even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.
\v 46 For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me.
\v 47 But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?
