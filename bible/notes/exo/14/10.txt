\v 11 Then they said to Moses, "Certainly you did not think that there was not enough room in Egypt for us to be buried. So why did you bring us here to die in this wilderness? Look what you have done to us by bringing us out of Egypt!
\v 12 That is what we told you when we were in Egypt. We said, 'Leave us alone, and let us work for the Egyptians.' It would have been better for us to be slaves for the Egyptians than to die here in the desert!"

\v 10 When Pharaoh came close, the Israelites looked up and were surprised.  The Egyptians were marching after them, and they were terrified.  The Israelites cried out to Yahweh.
\v 11 They said to Moses, "Is it because there were no graves in Egypt, that you have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us like this, bringing us out of Egypt?
\v 12 Isnâ€™t this what we told you in Egypt. We said to you, 'Leave us alone, so we can work for the Egyptians'? It would have been better for us to work for them than to die in the wilderness."
