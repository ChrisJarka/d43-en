  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_process|The Translation Process]]

The meaning of a text is the most crucial element. However, the form of the text is also very important. It is more than just a "container" for the meaning. It affects the way the meaning is understood and received. So the form itself also has a meaning.
For example, look at the differences in form between the and translations of Psalm 9:2.

2 Samuel 18:33

So we need to examine the form of the biblical text and ask ourselves why it has that form and not some other one. Other questions that might help us to understand the meaning of the form are: Who wrote it? Who received it? In what situation was it written? Which words and phrases were chosen and why? Are the words very emotional words, or is there anything special about the order of the words? When we understand the meaning of the form, then we can choose a form that has that same meaning in the target language and culture. 

==== Culture Affects Meaning ====
The meaning of forms is determined by culture. The same form might have different meanings in different cultures.
In translation, the meaning must remain the same. However, the form of the text must change to fit the culture. The form includes the language of the text. Of course, the language is only one element that makes up the form of the text.  There are many other ways in which the form of the text affects the meaning.
