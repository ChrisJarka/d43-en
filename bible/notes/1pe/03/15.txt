<usfm>
\v 15 but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: being ready always to give answer to every man that asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear:
\v 16 having a good conscience; that, wherein you are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.
\v 17 For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that you suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.
