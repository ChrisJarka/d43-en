\v 42 But there will be terrible punishment for you Pharisees! You give to God a tenth of \add all you produce, even\add* the various herbs that you grow, but you do not \add remember that you must act\add* justly \add toward others\add* and love God! It is good to \add give a tenth of your income to God\add*, but you ought to do these other things also!

<usfm>
\v 42 But how terrible it will be for you Pharisees! You carefully give to God a tenth of all you have, including even the herbs that you grow in your gardens.  But then you do not love God or act justly toward others. You should make sure that you love God and act justly toward others in addition to giving to God.

\v 42 But woe to you Pharisees, because you tithe the mint and rue and every other garden herb, but you neglect justice and the love of God. It is necessary to act justly and love God, without failing to do the other things also.
