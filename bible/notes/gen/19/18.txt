\v 18 But Lot said to one of them, "No, sir, don't make me do that!
\v 19 Please, listen. You have been pleased with me and have been very kind to me and spared my life. But I cannot flee to the mountain. If I try to do that, I will die in this disaster \f + \ft personification \f*.
\v 20 But listen to me. There is a town nearby. Let me run to that small town. Let me go there now. It is a small town, but our lives will be saved if we go there."

\v 18 Lot said to them, "No, please, my masters!
\v 19 Your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life, but I cannot escape to the mountains, because the disaster will overtake me, and I will die.
\v 20 Look, that city over there is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Please, let me escape there (is it not a little one?), and my life will be saved."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Your servant has found favor in your sight** - To be pleased with someone is spoken as if "favor" were an object that is found. Also, "sight" is a metonymy that stands for a person's thoughts or opinions. AT: "You have been pleased with me" (UDB) or "I have been accepted by you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Your servant has** - Lot was showing respect by referring to himself as "your servant." AT: "I, your servant, have" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **you have shown me great kindness in saving my life** - The abstract noun "kindness" can be stated as "kind." AT: "you have been very kind to me by saving my life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **I cannot escape to the mountains, because the disaster will overtake me, and I will die** - Being unable to get far away enough from Sodom when God destroys the city is spoken of as if "disaster" is a person that will chase and catch up with Lot. AT: "My family and I will certainly die when God destroys the people of Sodom, because the mountains are too far away for us to get there safely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **my life ... I cannot escape ... overtake me, and I will die** - It is implied that Lot's family would die along with him. AT: "our lives ... we cannot escape ... overtake us, and we will die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **is it not a little one?** - Lot used this rhetorical question to get the angels to notice that the city really is a small one. AT: "see how small it is." You could also translate this before or after the last sentence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **my life will be saved** - The implied information about how his life would be saved can be made explicit: "My life will be saved if you do not destroy that city."
