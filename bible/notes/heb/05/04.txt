\v 4 Furthermore, no one honors himself \add by appointing himself to become a high priest\add*. Instead, God chose each man \add to become a high priest\add*, as he chose Aaron \add to be the first high priest\add*.
\v 5 Similarly, Christ also did not honor himself by appointing himself to become a high priest. Instead, God \add appointed him by\add* saying to \add him what he never said to any other priest, what the\add* Psalmist wrote in the Scriptures,
\q You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are my Son! Today I have declared that I am your Father!

\q This day have I begotten thee:
