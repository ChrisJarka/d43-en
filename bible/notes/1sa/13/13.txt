\v 13 Samuel replied, "What you did was very foolish! You have not obeyed what Yahweh, your God, commanded \add about sacrifices\add*. If you had obeyed him, God would have allowed you and your descendants to rule \add Israel\add* for a long time.
\v 14 But now \add because of what you have done, you will die, and after you die\add*, none of your descendants will continue to rule. Yahweh is seeking for a man \add to be king\add* who be just the kind of person that he wants him to be, so that he can appoint him to be the leader of his people. Yahweh will do this because you have not obeyed what he commanded."

\v 13 And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of Jehovah your God, which he
commanded thee: for now would Jehovah have established your kingdom upon Israel for ever.
\v 14 But now your kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah has sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.
