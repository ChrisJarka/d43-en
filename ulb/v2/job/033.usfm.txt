\v 1 Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech,
\q And listen to all my words.
\q
\v 2 Behold now, I have opened my mouth;
\q My tongue has spoken in my mouth.
\q
\v 3 My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart;
\q And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.
\q
\v 4 The Spirit of God has made me,
\q And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
\q
\v 5 If you canst, answer you me;
\q Set your words in order before me, stand forth.
\q
\v 6 Behold, I am toward God even as you art:
\q I also am formed out of the clay.
\q
\v 7 Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid,
\q Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.
\b
\q
\v 8 Surely you have spoken in my hearing,
\q And I have heard the voice of your words, saying,
\q
\v 9 I am clean, without transgression;
\q I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:
\q
\v 10 Behold, he finds occasions against me,
\q He counts me for his enemy;
\q
\v 11 He puts my feet in the stocks,
\q He marketh all my paths.
\q
\v 12 Behold, I will answer thee, in this you are not just;
\q For God is greater than man.
\b
\q
\v 13 Why do you strive against him,
\q For that he gives not account of any of his matters?
\q
\v 14 For God speaks once,
\q Yes twice, though man regards it not.
\q
\v 15 In a dream, in a vision of the night,
\q When deep sleep falls upon men,
\q In slumberings upon the bed;
\q
\v 16 Then he opens the ears of men,
\q And sealeth their instruction,
\q
\v 17 That he may withdraw man from his purpose,
\q And hide pride from man;
\q
\v 18 He keeps back his soul from the pit,
\q And his life from perishing by the sword.
\b
\q
\v 19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,
\q And with continual strife in his bones;
\q
\v 20 So that his life abhorrs bread,
\q And his soul dainty food.
\q
\v 21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;
\q And his bones that were not seen stick out.
\q
\v 22 Yea, his soul draweth near to the pit,
\q And his life to the destroyers.
\b
\q
\v 23 If there be with him an angel,
\q An interpreter, one among a thousand,
\q To show to man what is right for him;
\q
\v 24 Then God is gracious to him, and saith,
\q Deliver him from going down to the pit,
\q I have found a ransom.
\q
\v 25 His flesh shall be fresher than a childâ€™s;
\q He returns to the days of his youth.
\q
\v 26 He prays to God, and he is favorable to him,
\q So that he sees his face with joy:
\q And he restoreth to man his righteousness.
\q
\v 27 He singeth before men, and saith,
\q I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,
\q And it profited me not:
\q
\v 28 He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit,
\q And my life shall behold the light.
\b
\q
\v 29 Lo, all these things does God work,
\q Twice, yes thrice, with a man,
\q
\v 30 To bring back his soul from the pit,
\q That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
\q
\v 31 Mark well, O Job, listen to me:
\q Hold your peace, and I will speak.
\q
\v 32 If you have anything to say, answer me:
\q Speak, for I desire to justify thee.
\q
\v 33 If not, listen you to me:
\q Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.
