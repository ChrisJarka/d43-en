\v 15 Because of the love of Jesus we must continually praise God no matter what happens. That will be something we can sacrifice to him instead of our sacrificing animals only at specific times. We must say openly that we have trusted in Christ.

<usfm>
\v 15 Through Jesus we should  constantly offer up a sacrifice of praise to God throughout everything, praise that is the fruit of our lips,  which confesses his name.
\v 16 And do not forget to do good by helping one another, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
\v 17 Obey and submit to your leaders, for they keep watch over you for the sake of your souls, as those who will give account. Obey so that with joy, and not grief which would not help you, your leaders may care for you.
