\v 17 I say that, because it is now time for God to begin judging people, and first he will judge those who belong \f + \ft metonymy \f* to him. Since he will judge us believers first, think about the terrible things that will happen to \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* those who do not obey the good message that comes from him!
\v 18  \add That will be as it\add* is written in the Scriptures,
\q  \add Many\add* righteous people  \add will have to suffer\add* many  \add difficult trials before going to heaven\add*. 
\q So ungodly and sinful people will surely have to suffer  \add much severe punishment from God\add*!
\p
\v 19 Therefore, those who suffer because of its being God's will that they suffer  \add because of being Christians\add* should commit themselves to God, the one who created them and the one who always does what he promises to do. And they should continue to do what is right.

\v 17 For the time is come for judgment to begin at the house of God: and if it begin first at us, what shall be the end of them that obey not the gospel of God?
\v 18 And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?
\v 19 Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.
