\v 18 What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof has graven it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he that shapes its form trusts therein, to make dumb idols?
\v 19 Woe to him that says to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.
\v 20 But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.
