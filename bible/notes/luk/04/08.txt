===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **But Jesus answered and said to him**  - That is "But Jesus responded to him,": or "But Jesus replied to him."
    * **It is written **- Rather "it has been written." This indicates authority and truthfulness, that is implying, "it is written in the Scriptures" or "it is written in the authoritative Scriptures."
    * **you must worship**- that is, "you must bow down in front of."  "You" refers to the people in the OT who received God's Law.  "Worship" physically means "bow down in front of" but it symbolizes submitting to, honoring, and obeying the one to whom you bow.
    * **you must serve him only**  - "Him" refers to the Lord.  "Serve" means to do the will of someone, to be his servant.
    * **serve**- this word literally means "serve with sacrifices and prayers like a priest" and "serve" in this context also means "do the will of" or "obey."
