\v 6 When you teach these things to your fellow believers, you will be showing that you, \add whom\add* Christ Jesus \add appointed\add*, serve them well. You will have become strong \add spiritually\add* by holding fast\f + \ft Or: by obeying \f* the true message that \add we all\add* believe.
\v 7 You must completely reject godless, silly\f + \ft Or: foolish \f* stories \add from your ancestors that old people tell\add*. Keep training yourself so that you have more godly behavior\f + \ft Or: behavior that pleases God \f*.
\v 8 \add Some people say\add*, "It helps us in some ways if we exercise our bodies." But \add I say that\add* people benefit very much if they live in a godly way\f + \ft Or: in a way that pleases God \f*, because \add if people live in a godly way, that\add* will benefit them both while they live now and when they live in the future life \add in heaven\add*.

\v 6 If you keep speaking this truth to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ. You will serve him well, because the message that we believe has fed you, like the good things God has taught you and that you have followed.
\v 7 But do not listen to the things that mean nothing and to the stories that only old women tell. Instead, train yourself to honor God.
\v 8 Physical exercise helps only a little, but if you honor God, this will help you with everything in this life and in the life to come.

\p
\v 6 If you place this before the brethren, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ because you have been trained by the words of faith and by the good teaching that you have followed.
\v 7 But do not accept godless stories of old women, but train yourself in godliness.
\v 8 For bodily exercise is only a little useful, but godliness is profitable for all things and holds promise for this life now and the life to come.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **place this before**  - "put these thoughts in the believers' minds" or "help the believers remember these words." The "thoughts" and "words" refer to all the teachings from 3:16 to 4:5.
  * **you have been trained by the words of faith and by the good teaching**  - [awaiting response from text team]
  * **words of faith**  - "words that cause people to believe"
  * **godless stories of old women**  - "profane and old-womanish myths." The word for **godless**  is the same as for "profane" in 1:9 (see [[:en:bible:notes:key-terms:profane|profane]]). The word for **stories**  is the same as for "myths" in 1:4, so you should translate it the same here. The reference to **old women**  is probably a metaphor for "silly" or "absurd." (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]].) Paul is not purposely insulting women in his reference to “old women.” Instead, he and his audience knew that men die younger than women, so there are more women than men whose minds have become feeble.
  * **train yourself in godliness** - "train yourself to be more godly" or "train yourself to act in ways that please God" or "work hard to become more godly"
  * **bodily exercise**  - "physical exercise"
  * **holds promise for this life**  - "is beneficial to this life" or "helps to make this life better"
