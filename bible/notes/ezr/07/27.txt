\v 27 Bless Yahweh, the God of our Fathers who set such as this into the heart of the king to glorify the house of Yahweh that is in Jerusalem,
\v 28 and extended covenant-faithfulness to me before the king and his counselors and all the powerful officials of the king. For I have been strengthened as the hand of Yahweh 
my God was upon me, and I gathered from Israel the chiefs to go up with me.
