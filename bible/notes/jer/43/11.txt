\v 11 And he shall come, and shall strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death
shall be given to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.
\v 12 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and he
shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
\v 13 He shall also break the pillars of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall
he burn with fire.
