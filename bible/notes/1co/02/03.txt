\v 3 Furthermore, when I was with you, I felt that I was not adequate  \add to do what Christ wanted me to do\add*. I was afraid  \add that I would not be able to do it\add*, and because of that I was trembling very much.
\v 4 When I taught you and preached to you, I did not speak words that  \add unbelievers would consider\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise in order to convince them that my message was true. Instead, \add God's\add* Spirit showed that it was true by  \add enabling me to\add* powerfully  \add perform miracles\add*.
\v 5  \add I taught and preached that way\add* in order that you might believe  \add my message\add*, not because you heard words that people  \add considered to be\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise, but  \add because you realized\add* God's power.

\v 3 I was with you in physical weakness, and in terrifying fear of my opponents; and I was shaken by the dread of what could happen next.
\v 4 You heard the content of my message, you know my words were carefully chosen, but you heard by my preaching that I was not at all impressive by human standards. I did not try to captivate you with human wisdom and people's arguments. My proclamation was to show the Spirit working, by his great power, through me.
\v 5  I taught and preached this way so your faith would not rest on human wisdom, but on that same power of God working in you.

\v 3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
\v 4 And my word and my proclamation were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but they were in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
\v 5 So that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
