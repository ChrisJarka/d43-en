A rhetorical question is a question to which the speaker does not expect an answer because he is not looking for information. Speakers use rhetorical questions to express deep emotion or to encourage hearers to think deeply about something. The Bible contains many rhetorical questions, often to express sarcasm or to rebuke or scold the hearer. Speakers of some languages use rhetorical questions for other reasons as well.

==== Description ====

A rhetorical question is a question to which the speaker does not expect an answer because he is not looking for information. Speakers often use rhetorical questions to rebuke or scold people. 

>Those who stood by said, "__Is this how you insult God's high priest?__" (Acts 23:4 ULB)
The people did not ask this question in order to get information. Rather they used it to scold Paul because they did not think he should have spoken as he did to the high priest.

The Bible contains many rhetorical questions. Some of the purposes of these rhetorical questions are to remind people of something that they already know, to express strong emotion, to say something in a strong way, or to introduce something they want to talk about. 


=== Reasons this is a translation issue ===

  * Some readers may think that a question is a request for information. 
  * Some languages use rhetorical questions only for scolding.
  * Some readers might think that the purpose of a question is something other than what it really is.


==== Examples from the Bible ====

>Those who stood by said, "__Is this how you insult God's high priest?__" (Acts 23:4 ULB)
Those who stood by were scolding Paul because they did not think he should have spoken as he did to the high priest.

>Jezebel his wife replied to him, "__Do you not still rule the kingdom of Israel?__" (1 Kings 21:7 ULB)
Jezebel was rebuking King Ahab for being unwilling to take over a poor man's property. She was implying that since he was the king of Israel he should feel free to take the man's property.

>Zedekiah ... slapped Micaiah on the cheek, and said, "__Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh take to go from me to speak to you?__" (1 Kings 22:24 ULB)
Zedekiah was sarcastically repeating Micaiah's words that Yahweh had spoken to Micaiah.

>__Why did I not die when I came out from the womb?__ (Job 3:11 ULB)
Job was saying that he was so sad that he wished he had never been born.

==== Translation Strategies ====

Be sure you know that you are dealing with a rhetorical question and not an information question. Then be sure you know what the purpose of the rhetorical question is. Is it to encourage or rebuke or shame the hearer? Is it to bring up a new topic? Is it to do something else?

If using the rhetorical question would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider doing so. If not, here are other options:
  - Add the answer after the question.
  - Change the rhetorical question to a statement.
  - Change the rhetorical question to a statement, and then follow it with a short question.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. Add the answer after the question.
  * **__Will a virgin forget her jewelry, a bride her veils?__ Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number!** (Jeremiah 2:32 ULB)
    * "__Will a virgin forget her jewelry, a bride her veils? Of course not!__ Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number!"

  * **Zedekiah ... slapped Micaiah on the cheek, and said, "__Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh take to go from me to speak to you?__"** (1 Kings 22:24 ULB)
    * "Zedekiah ... slapped Micaiah on the cheek, and said, '__Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh take to go from me to speak to you? You fool, he did no such thing!__'"

2. Change the rhetorical question to a statement.
  * **Those who stood by said, "__Is this how you insult God's high priest?__"** (Acts 23:4 ULB)
    * "Those who stood by said, '__You should not insult God's high priest!__'"

  * **__Why did I not die when I came out from the womb?__** (Job 3:11 ULB)
    * "__I wish I had died when I came out from the womb!__"

3. Change the rhetorical question to a statement, and then follow it with a short question.
  * **Jezebel his wife replied to him, "__Do you not still rule the kingdom of Israel?__"** (1 Kings 21:7 ULB)
    * "Jezebel his wife replied to him, "__You still rule the kingdom of Israel, don't you?__""
