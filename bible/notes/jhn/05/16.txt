\v 16 And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.
\v 17 But Jesus answered them, My Father works even until now, and I work.
\v 18 For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God
his own Father, making himself equal with God.
