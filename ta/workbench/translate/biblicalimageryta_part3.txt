====== Biblical Imagery - Cultural Models ======
===== Description =====


The Scriptures employ cultural models, which can be described as systems of thought that are more elaborate and more developed than metaphorical patterns and metonymies. Some of these models, at least, were used extensively in the Ancient Near East, and not only among the Israelites.

In the list below the image is written in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.

=== Model of THEOPHANY (GOD REVEALING HIMSELF) ===

Psalm 18:7-14 

=== Model of God as a HUMAN BEING ===

Although the Scriptures explicitly deny that God is a human being, he is often spoken of as performing human actions and having human emotions, etc. This kind of language is so general that the God-human model is often overlooked. Nevertheless, when the Scriptures say that God speaks, we are not to imagine, for example, that he has vocal chords that vibrate. Neither is it the case that when the Scriptures present us with language like the following (e.g., //The hand of God also came on Judah, to give them one heart to carry out the command of the king and leaders by the word of Yahweh//  –2 Chron. 30:12) , we are to attribute to God a physical hand.

We commonly say that //hand //  here is a case of metonymy. Certainly metonymy is involved in this case, but the figure of speech in 1 Chron. 30:12 must involve more than metonymy only. The notion of inducing //hand of God //  to represent divine agency and power can work only if the hand itself can be attributed to God, where //hand //  is then used as a metonym for //God//. But //hand //  cannot be **literally **  attributed to God, so it must be **metaphorically **  attributed to him. On what basis? On the only possible basis: on the model of God as a human being.

Consequently, we must regard //the hand of God//  in its sense of divine agency and power as actually an example of a **combination of a model, metonym, //and //  underlying metaphor**, rather than as a simple metonym. The model is **God as a human being**, the metonym is **hand standing for God**, and the underlying metaphor is** hand representing agency and power**.


=== Model of God as KING ===

> For God is the King over all the earth; (Psalm 47:7 ULB)

>For the __kingdom__ is Yahweh's;
>he is the __ruler__ over the nations. (Psalm 22:28 ULB)

>Your __throne__, God, is forever and ever;
>a __scepter__ of justice is the scepter of your __kingdom__. (Psalm 45:6 ULB)

This is what Yahweh says,
"Heaven is my __throne__, and the earth is my __footstool__. (Isaiah 66:1 ULB)

>God __reigns__ over the nations;
>God sits on his holy __throne__.
>The __princes__ of the peoples have gathered together
>to the people of the God of Abraham;
>for the __shields__ of the earth belong to God;
>he is greatly exalted.  (Psalm 47:8-9 ULB)

=== Model of God as SHEPHERD ===

> Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing. (Psalm 23:1 ULB)

His people are sheep
> For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. (Psalm 95:7 ULB)

He leads his people like sheep
>He led his own people out like sheep and guided them through the wilderness like a flock. (Psalm 78:52 ULB)

He is willing to die in order to save his sheep.
> I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me. The Father knows me, and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep that are not of this fold. Those, also, I must bring, and they will hear my voice so that there will be one flock and one shepherd. John 10:14-15 ULB)


=== Model of God as WARRIOR ===

>Yahweh is a warrior; (Exodus 15:3 ULB)

> Yahweh will go out as a warrior; he will proceed as a man of war. He will stir up his zeal.
> He will shout, yes, he will roar his battle cries; he will show his enemies his power. (Isaiah 42:13 ULB)

>Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power;
>your right hand, Yahweh, has shattered the enemy. (Exodus 15:6 ULB

>But God will shoot them;
>suddenly they will be wounded with his arrows. (Psalm 65:7 ULB)

>For you will turn them back; you will draw your bow before them. (Psalm 21:12 ULB)



=== Model of leaders as SHEPHERDS === 

Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Look...when Saul was king over us, it was you who led the Israelite army. Yahweh said to you, 'You will __shepherd__ my people Israel, and you will become ruler over Israel.' " (2 Samuel 5:1-2 ULB)

> "Woe to the __shepherds__ who destroy and scatter the __sheep__ of my __pasture__—this is Yahweh's declaration."  (Jeremiah 23:1  ULB)

>Therefore be careful about yourselves, and about all the __flock__ of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be careful to __shepherd__ the assembly of the Lord, which he purchased with his own blood. 29I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, and not spare the __flock__. I know that from even among your own selves some men shall come and say corrupt things, in order to draw away the disciples after them. (Acts 20:28-30 ULB)

===Model of a distressing situation as a WILDERNESS ===


===Model of the sun as BEING IN A CONTAINER AT NIGHT===


>Yet their words go out over all the earth and their speech to the end of the world. He has pitched __a tent for the sun__ among them. The sun is like a bridegroom coming out of __his chamber__ and like a strong man who rejoices when he runs his race. (Psalm 19:4-5 ULB)

>from __the womb__ of the dawn your youth will be to you like the dew.  (Psalm 110:3c ULB)
This pictures the sun as being in the womb before it comes out in the morning. 


=== MODEL OF BLOOD AS LIFE [[Model of life as BLOOD?]]===

In this model, the blood of a person or an animal represents life.

>In this way, this person would not die by the hand of the one who wanted to avenge the blood that was shed, until the accused person would first stand before the assembly. (Joshua 20:9 ULB)

If blood is **spilled** or **shed**, someone has been killed.

>Whoever sheds man's blood, by man will his blood be shed, (Genesis 9:6 ULB)

If blood is **poured out**, there is death.

If blood **cries out**, nature itself is crying out for vengeance on a person who killed someone. (This also includes Personification, because the blood is pictured as someone that can call out. See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

>Yahweh said, "What have you done? Your brother's blood is calling out to me from the ground. (Genesis 4:10 ULB) 

>But you must not eat meat with its life—that is its blood—in it. (Genesis 9:4 ULB) [[I added this, because it shows the association. But here it seems like the blood is the reality and it is being associated with the life of the animal.]]

=== Model of a  country as a WIFE and of its as HER HUSBAND ===

=== Model of the WIND as FUTILITY [[Model of futility as WIND?]]===

=== Model of COVENANTS ===

===Model of HUMAN WARFARE as DIVINE WARFARE  ===
I'm not sure which is the reality and which is the image.

===Model of GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES as OTHER CONSTRAINTS IN LIFE  [[Model of constraints in life as GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES]]===

===Model of wellbeing as PHYSICAL CLEANLINESS, and of evil as PHYSICAL DIRTINESS===

===Model of HONOR AND SHAME===

===Model of good as EXISTING IN LIMITED AMOUNTS===

===Model of THE EVIL EYE===
[[Since this section tells about both cursing and blessing, light and dark, maybe it could be generalized to "Model of the eye as a LAMP"]]

Variations of this model are found in many parts of the world. In most of the cultures represented in the Bible, the model included the following elements:

1. People see objects, not because of ambient light reflected off them, but because of light that emerges from their eyes onto those objects. 
>The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore, if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. (Matthew 6:22 ULB)

2. This emergent light carries with itself the viewer's character. 
>The appetite of the wicked craves evil; his neighbor sees no kindness in his eyes.  (Proverbs 21:10 ULB)

3. The primary quality of a person with the evil eye is envy. 

>He said, "It is that which comes out of the person that defiles him. For from within a person, out of the heart, proceed evil thoughts…, envy  …. (Mark 7:20-22 ULB) 
The Greek word translated as "envy" is "eye," which would refer here to an evil eye.

>Is it not legitimate for me to do what I wish with my own possessions? Or is your eye evil because I am good? (Matthew 20:15 ULB) 
The context for Matthew 20:15 includes the emotion of envy.

4. To look at a person with an evil eye is to lay a curse or enchantment on him.
>Foolish Galatians, whose evil eye has harmed you? [Lit., //who has bewitched you with the evil eye?//]. (Galatians 3:1 ULB) 
[[Gal 3:1. The Greek text on Biblehub has nothing about an eye in this clause. Is there a textual variant here?]]

Look at how these elements come together in Luke 11:33-36: [[Jim, I wonder if this part below is going into more detail than is needed for this page. It seems like some of this could be in the notes.]]

>No one, after lighting a lamp, places it in a dark closet or under a basket, but on a lampstand so that those who enter may have light. (Luke 11:33 ULB)

>Your eye is the lamp of the body. (Luke 11:34a ULB) [Analogy of the eye to a lamp]

Luke 11:34 pictures the eye as a lamp.

>When your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. (Luke 11:34b ULB)
Having a good eye is a sign that you have goodness within yourself.  (This also has the metaphor of LIGHT representing goodness. See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_phenom]] [[workbench page]])

>But when your eye is bad, your body is full of darkness. (Luke 11:34c ULB)
Having a bad eye is a sign that you have evil within yourself ((This also has the metaphor of DARKNESS representing evil. See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_phenom]] [[workbench page]])

>Therefore, be careful that the light in you is not darkness. (Luke 11:35 ULB) \\ 
This means ensure that you have goodness and not evil within yourself.

>If then, your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, then your whole body will be like when a lamp shines its brightness on you. (Luke 11:36 ULB)

The eye projects the goodness or evil that is inside the body onto whatever it gazes at. In this way, the eye bestows either a blessing or a curse. The following example shows the eye bestowing a blessing.
> "If I have found favor in your eyes...". (1 Samuel 27:5)

===Model of the Nation of Israel as GOD'S SON===

>When Israel was a young man I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt.  (Hosea 11:1 ULB)
