===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 So it will be in that day--this is Yahweh's declaration--a cry of distress will come from the fish gate, and wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing sound from the hills.
\v 11 Wail, inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan will be ruined; all those who are weighted down with silver will be cut off.  [[I kept Maktesh rather than the more ambiguous "inhabitants of mortar." It could be talking about those who inhabit built structures, but a geographic/regional reading is sensible.]]
