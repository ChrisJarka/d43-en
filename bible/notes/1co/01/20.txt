\v 20 So, do you know \add what God thinks\add* about what \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* people who \f + \ft irony \f* consider themselves to be wise and scholars and philosophers say? \add He does not pay attention to what they say, because\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* he has shown clearly that what unbelievers \add think is\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise is \add not wise at all\add*, but is really foolish.
\v 21 God, acting very wisely, made it impossible for unbelievers to know God by doing what they thought was \f + \ft irony \f* wise. Instead, he was happy to save those who trust \add in Christ\add* as the result of their hearing \add the message that\add* was proclaimed to them, a message that others consider to be foolish.

\v 20 So where is the man who knows all the wisdom of this world? Where is he who studies human science and history? And where is the one who tries to convince you with brilliant arguments and compelling politics? Had not God declared that all the wisdom of this world, no matter how it is displayed, is just foolishness?
\v 21 When the world acted on its wisdom, it could never find God. But God had a different plan: Through plain proclamation of the message, which seemed to be so foolish -- both those who preached and in terms of the message they gave -- in that message God was delighted to save all those who trusted in him.

\v 20 Where is the wise? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
\v 21 Since the world in its wisdom did not know God,   God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
