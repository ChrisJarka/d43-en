<usfm>
\v 1 Dear ones, whom God loves, since God has given us these promises, let us remove all moral filth from us and anything that would stand in the way of our worshiping of God. Let us make ourselves clean on the outside and in our inner person, as we are careful in the way we approach God, because he is holy. We tremble at his commands. God is not like us, his holiness makes us tremble with fear.
