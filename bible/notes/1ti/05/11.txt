====== 1 Timothy 05:11-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 As for younger widows, do not put their names on that list, because they \add promise to do work for the congregation, but instead of doing that, they usually\add* want to marry \add again\add* \f + \ft Or: marry an unbeliever \f* when they have strong desires.
\v 12 If that happens, they may become guilty of not having done what they had promised \add to do for the congregation\add* \f + \ft Or: promised \add Christ that they would do\add*. \f*
\v 13 In addition, they \add generally\add* become lazy. Specifically, as they \add just\add* go about from house to house they also begin to gossip\f + \ft Or: to talk about people \f* and to meddle in other people's affairs, saying what they should not say.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 But younger widows refuse, because when bodily desires against Christ overcome them, they want to marry
\v 12 and then they feel guilty because they have rejected their vow.
\v 13 Also, they go from house to house and learn to do nothing.  They do foolishness and trivial activities and say what is not needed.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11But as for younger widows, do not enroll them in the list, because when they are overcome by bodily desires against Christ, they want to marry.
\v 12 In this way they incur guilt because they revoke their prior commitment.
\v 13 Also, they learn idleness, going around to house. Not only do they learn idleness, but they also learn to be gossips and meddlesome, saying things they should not say.
