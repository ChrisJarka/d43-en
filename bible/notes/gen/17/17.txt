===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Abram bowed low with his face to the ground** - This can also be translated as “Abram threw himself face down on the ground” or “Abraham immediately lay down with his face to the ground.” He did this to show that he respected God and would obey him.
  * **And said in his heart**  - This can also be translated as "and thought to himself" or "and said to himself silently."
  * **Can a man who is a hundred years old father a child?**  - Abraham used this rhetorical question because he did not believe that this could happen. It could also be translated as a statement: "Surely a man who is a hundred years old could not father a child." (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]]).
  * **Can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a son?**  - Again Abraham used a rhetorical question because he did not believe this could happen. The relative clause "who is ninety years old" could be expressed as a separate sentence: "Sarah is ninety years old. Could she bear a son?" or "Sarah is ninety years old. Surely she could not bear a son." (See the section on clauses in [[:en:ta:vocabulary:sentencestructure]])
  * **Oh that Ishmael might live before you** - Abraham was suggesting something that he believed really could happen. It could also be translated as "Could Ishmael live before you?" or "Perhaps Ishmael could be the one to receive your blessing."
