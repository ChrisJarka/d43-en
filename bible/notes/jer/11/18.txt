\v 18 And Jehovah gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then you showedst me their doings.
\v 19 But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me,
saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his
name may be no more remembered.
\v 20 But, O Jehovah of hosts, who judge righteously, who triest the heart and the mind, I shall see your vengeance on them;
for to you have I revealed my cause.
