\v 11 When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the dialect of Lycaonia, "The gods have come down to us in the form of men."
\v 12 They called Barnabas "Zeus," and Paul, "Hermes,"  because he was the main speaker.
\v 13 The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and wreaths to the gates; he and the multitudes wanted to offer sacrifice.
