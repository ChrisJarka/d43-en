\v 17 Furthermore, because we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* Jews\add* desired that \add God\add* would erase the record of our sins because of our relationship with Christ, \add it means that\add* we realized that we ourselves were sinners \add like non-Jews, whom we called\add* sinners, \add because we\f + \ft exclusive \f* also were not obeying the Jewish rituals and laws\add*. \add But\add* \add we\f + \ft inclusive \f* certainly cannot conclude\add* that it is Christ who causes us to sin.\f + \ft Or: \add should we conclude\add* that it is Christ who causes us to sin? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add No, Christ\add* certainly does not \add cause anyone to sin\add*.
\p
\v 18 So if I should again believe \add that God would erase the record of my sins because of my obeying the laws that he gave to Moses\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add I would be like a man who\add* rebuilds an old building that he tore down. It would \add soon\add* be clear that I am one who disobeys those same laws \add that God gave to Moses\add*.
\v 19 When \add I realized that I could not earn God's favor\add* by \add obeying\add* the laws \add that he gave to Moses, I decided not\add* to \add respond to what those laws demanded\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like\add* a dead person \add does not respond to anything\add*. Now I live to \add honor\f + \ft Or: serve \f*\add* God.

\v 17 Furthermore, because we Jews desired that God would erase the record of our sins because of our relationship with Christ, it means that we realized that we ourselves were sinners like non-Jews, whom we called sinners, because we also were not obeying the Jewish rituals and laws. But we certainly cannot conclude that it is Christ who causes us to sin. No, Christ certainly does not cause anyone to sin.

\v 18 So if I should again believe that God would erase the record of my sins because of my obeying the laws that he gave to Moses, I would be like a man who rebuilds an old building that he tore down. It would soon be clear that I am one who disobeys those same laws that God gave to Moses.

\v 17 But if when we seek God to justify us in Christ we also find ourselves as sinners, does Christ become a minister of sin? Absolutely not!
\v 18 For if I trust law-keeping again to save me, which I destroyed, I show myself to be a law breaker.
\v 19 Through the law I died to the law, that I might live for God.
