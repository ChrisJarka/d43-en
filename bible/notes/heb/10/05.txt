\v 5 Wherefore when he comes into the world, he saith,
\q Sacrifice and offering you would not,
\q But a body did you prepare for me;
\q
\v 6 In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you had no pleasure:
\q
\v 7 Then said I, Lo, I am come (In the roll of the book it is written of me)
\q To do your will, O God.
