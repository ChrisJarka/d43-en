====== unclean ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "unclean" means "dirty" or "stained." In the Bible, it is often used figuratively to mean, "sinful" or "imperfect" or "evil."

  * God gave the Israelites many instructions about not touching "unclean" things. Often this had to do with things that had germs or disease.
  * A Jewish priest who touched something that God had declared to be unclean, would himself be unclean and not fit to perform his religious duties.
  * In the Old Testament, God told the Israelites which animals were "clean" and which ones were "unclean." The unclean animals could not be used for eating or for sacrifice.
  * An unclean animal was not necessarily dirty; it just meant it could not be eaten and could not be used for sacrifice.
