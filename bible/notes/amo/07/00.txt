====== Amos 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapter 7 changes things. This chapter is written mainly in prose and is a narrative about Amos the prophet and Yahweh interacting. Yahweh presents three different scenarios of judgment before Amos who pleads with God and He relents, which means He does not carry out His judgment. The rest of the chapter then moves to Amos' interaction with the priest, Amaziah. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

In the latter part of the chapter, it is important to follow the conversation carefully to understand if Amos is speaking with Amaziah. There is some instances of "reported speech". Please review [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]]
