\v 13 Zedekiah also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear loyalty to him by God. But Zedekiah stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 14 Moreover, all the leaders of the priests and the people were horribly unfaithful, and they followed the disgusting practices of the nations. They polluted the house of Yahweh which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.

  * **they followed the disgusting practices of the nations** - The idiom "followed the ... practices" means to do those things. AT: "they did the disgusting things that the nations did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **disgusting practices** - This phrase refers to worshiping other gods. 
  * **They polluted the house of Yahweh** - A place that is unfit to be used for God's purposes is spoken of as if it were physically dirty. The word "house" represents the temple.
