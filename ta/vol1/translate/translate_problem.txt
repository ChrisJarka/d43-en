===== Problems with Literal Translations =====

This module answers the question: What are several problems with translations that are too literal?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[https://door43.org/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_literal|Literal Translations]]

**1. The meaning of forms change**\\
Supporters of very literal translations correctly understand a basic principle of translationâ€”that the form affects the meaning. However, they often forget that the understanding of forms varies with the culture. When culture changes, forms may be understood in very different ways. It is not possible to protect the meaning from change by keeping the original forms. The only way to protect the meaning is to change to new forms that communicate the same meaning in the new culture as the old forms did in the old culture.\\
**2. Some terms do not have equivalents in other cultures**\\
The Bible contains many terms for things that no longer exist, such as ancient weights (stadia, cubit), money (denarius, stater) and measures (hin, ephah). Animals in Scripture may not exist in some parts of the world (fox, camel). Other words may be unknown in some cultures (snow, circumcision). It is not possible to simply substitute equivalent words for these terms in those situations. The translator must find another way to communicate the original meaning.\\
**3. The Bible was intended to be understood**\\
The testimony of the Scriptures themselves shows that they were meant to be understood. The Bible is written in three languages because the language of the people changed. When the Jews returned from exile and no longer remembered Hebrew, the priests translated the Old Testament readings into Aramaic so they could understand (Neh 8:8). And the New Testament is written in the common Koine Greek that everyone spoke instead of in classical Greek.
These and other reasons demonstrate that the God wants people to understand His Word. The meaning of the Scriptures is more important than the form.\\
