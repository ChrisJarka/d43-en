====== Matthew 05:19-20 ======

<usfm>
\v 19 Since \add all God's laws are important\add*, if anyone disobeys any of those commandments, \add even if it would be\add* one of the least \add important ones\add*, and if that person teaches people \add to disobey any of those commandments\add*, it will be said \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will say \f* that that person is the least \add important\add* of those in the place where \f + \ft euphemism \f* God rules. But those who obey \add those commandments\add* and teach \add other people to obey them, it will be said\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will say \f* that they are very important among those that God rules.
\v 20 Keep this in mind: \add You assume that\add* the Pharisees and the men who teach our laws \add faithfully obey\add* what God commands. But if you do not obey those laws better than they obey them, you will by no means enter the place where God \f + \ft euphemism \f* rules."

\v 19 Because that is true, if you break even a little part of those commands, and if you teach others to break them, you will be the least important under God's rule. However, if you keep all those commands and teach others to do the same thing, you will become very important at that time in God's government.
\v 20 Because of this, I tell you that you must obey those laws better than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you do not, God will allow you under his rule.

<usfm>
\v 19 Therefore whoever breaks the least one of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever keeps them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 20 For I say to you that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will in no way enter the kingdom of heaven.
