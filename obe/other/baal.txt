====== Baal ======

===== Facts: =====

Baal was the name of a false god that was worshiped by several people groups in the land of Canaan.

  * The name "Baal" means "lord" and he was falsely believed to be the most powerful god who caused the land to produce more crops and who helped people have more children.
  * 
  * Baal was the name of the supreme god worshiped in ancient Canaan and Phoenicia. The practice of Baal worship infiltrated Jewish religious life during the time of the Judges (Judges 3:7), became widespread in Israel during the reign of Ahab (1 Kings 16:31-33) and also affected Judah (2 Chronicles 28:1-2). The word baal means “lord”; the plural is baalim. In general, Baal was a fertility god who was believed to enable the earth to produce crops and people to produce children. Different regions worshiped Baal in different ways, and Baal proved to be a highly adaptable god. Various locales emphasized one or another of his attributes and developed special “denominations” of Baalism. Baal of Peor (Numbers 25:3) and Baal-Berith (Judges 8:33) are two examples of such localized deities. 

According to Canaanite mythology, Baal was the son of El, the chief god, and Asherah, the goddess of the sea. Baal was considered the most powerful of all gods, eclipsing El, who was seen as rather weak and ineffective.  The worship of Baal was therefore a direct challenge to the authority of Yahweh, who alone is the only true Lord.
  * The worship of Baal included practices that were immoral, including sacrificing children and prostitution.
  * At different times throughout their history, the Israelites sinned by also worshiping Baal.
  * During the reign of King Ahab, God's prophet Elijah set up a test to prove to the people that Baal does not exist and that Yahweh is the only true God.
  * As a result, the people killed the prophets of Baal and turned back to worshiping Yahweh.
