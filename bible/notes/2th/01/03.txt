\v 3 We should give thanks to God always for you, brothers, even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all towards one another abounds.
\v 4 so that We ourselves boast about you among the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure.
\v 5 This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you also suffer.
