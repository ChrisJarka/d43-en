\v 1 We \add know about\add* many people like that\add who showed they trusted in God\add*. They are like a crowd of spectators \add who are cheering for us inside a stadium\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Knowing that, we must put away all the things that hinder us, \add as a runner puts aside everything that would hinder him because they are heavy\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Especially we must put away sinful actions that \add hinder us, as a runner\add* sets aside clothes he does not need, clothes that would entangle him \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Let us \add wholeheartedly strive to achieve what God has planned for us, as someone\add* in a race wholeheartedly runs the course that is before him \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 2 And let us \add keep our minds on\add* Jesus, \add as a runner\add* keeps his eyes on \add the goal\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. He is the one we should imitate concerning how he perfectly trusted \add God. When he died on\add* the cross he endured it when he suffered greatly \f + \ft metonymy \f*, instead of \add thinking about the things he would\add* rejoice about \add later\add*. He disregarded being disgraced by \add dying that way\add*. He is now sitting at the place of highest honor \f + \ft metonymy \f* at the throne \add where God rules\add*.


\p
\v 3 \add Jesus\add* patiently endured it when sinful people acted so hostilely against him. Compare yourselves with him so that you do not give up \add trusting\add* God or become discouraged.
\v 4 While you have struggled against \add being tempted to\add* sin, you have not yet bled \add and died because of resisting evil, as Jesus did\add*.
\v 5 Do not forget \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* these words \add that Solomon spoke to his son, that are the same as God\add* would exhort you as his children:
\q My child, pay attention \f + \ft litotes \f* when the Lord is disciplining you,
\q and do not be discouraged when the Lord punishes you \f + \ft doublet \f*,
\q
\v 6 because it is everyone whom he loves whom the Lord disciplines,
\q and he punishes everyone whom he accepts as his child.

\p
\v 1 Therefore since we are surrounded about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us cast off every burden, and the sin which so easily traps us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
\v 2 looking to Jesus the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, ignored any shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
\v 3 For consider him that has endured such opposition of sinners against himself, so that you  do not become weary or faint hearted.
s5
\v 4 You have not yet resisted to blood, struggling against sin.
\v 5 And you have forgotten the encouragement which instructs you as sons,
\q "My son, do not lightly regard the chastening of the Lord,
\q Nor faint when you are disciplined by him;"
\q
\v 6 For whom the Lord loves he disciplines,
\q And  he punishes every son whom he receives.
