\v 17 Moses proclaimed God's laws to the Jewish people. Jesus Christ was kind to us far beyond what we deserved and taught us true things about God.
\v 18 No one has ever seen God. But God's only Son, Jesus Christ, who is always close to the Father, he has made us know him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **fullness** - This word refers to God's grace that has no end.
  * **free gift after free gift** - "blessing after blessing"
  * **The one and only person, himself God** - This can mean 1) "the one and only God" or 2) "the one and only Son."
  * **who is in the bosom of the Father** - "who is constantly with the Father," implying a close relationship (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Jesus Christ...The one and only...God...in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.** - Despite the textual variant, Jesus is described here as he is in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:03:16|John 3:16]], as the one and only, unique Son of God, who is "himself God." He is loved by the Father, so the Son makes his Father's love  known to the world. The words "Father" and "Son" are very important to the meaning here.
