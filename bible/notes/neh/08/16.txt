\v 16 So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in
their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the
gate of Ephraim.
\v 17 And all the assembly of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and lived in the booths: for since
the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.
