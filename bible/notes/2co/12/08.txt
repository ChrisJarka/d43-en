<usfm>
\v 8 Three times I prayed to the Lord about it, begging him to take this away from me.
\v 9 But he said to me, "\add No, I will not take this away from you. Instead\add*, I will kindly help you, and that will be all that you need, because it is \add when you are\add* weak that I \add can\add* best \add work\add* powerfully \add to help you\add*." So, because of \add what the Lord said to me\add*, I will very gladly boast about \add the things that make\add* me \add seem\add* weak, so that \add people may realize\add* that it is Christ who gives me power \add to serve him\add*.
\v 10 For that reason, \add whenever I am\add* weak, or \add when people\add* insult me, \add or when I have to endure\add* hardships, or \add when I am persecuted\add* \f + \ft Or:\add people\add* cause me to suffer \f* or \add when I am in situations that\add* distress me, I am content because \add I am serving\add* Christ. \add I can say that\add* because at any time when I myself am weak, that is the \add very\add* time when \add Christ\add* powerfully \add helps me\add*.

\v 8 Three times I prayed to the Lord about it, and each time I begged him to take this away from me.
\v 9 But he said to me, "No, I will not take this away from you. But, my love for you and my promise to be with you will be all you need. When you are weak that is when I can do my most powerful work in you." So, I would rather be proud of my weaknesses so the power of Christ can come and make me strong.
\v 10 Therefore, I can face anything because Christ is with me. It may be that I must face weaknesses, or I could be treated with contempt or even hated by others, or I could go through great difficulties that seem to have no end, or be face terrifying violence, or face people who want to hurt me physically, all because when I am weak, then I am strong.

\v 8 Three times I begged the Lord about this, that he might take it from me.
\v 9 And he said to me, "My grace is enough for you, for power is made perfect in weakness." So I would much rather boast in my weakness, so the power of Christ might rest on me.
\v 10 Therefore I am content, for Christâ€™s sake, in weaknesses, in insults, in troubles, in persecutions, in distresses, for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.
