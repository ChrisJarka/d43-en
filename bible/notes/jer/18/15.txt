<usfm>
\v 15 But my people are not \add as reliable as those streams\add*:
\q2 They have abandoned me.
\q1 They burn incense to \add honor\f + \ft Or: worship \f*\add* worthless idols.
\q1 \add It is as though\add* they have stumbled as they walked along very old roads that are good roads,
\q2 and now, instead, they are walking on dirt paths.
\q1
\v 16 Therefore, their land will become desolate,
\q2 and people who see it will hiss \add to ridicule it\add*.
\q1 All the people who pass by will be appalled;
\q2 they will shake their heads \add to show that they are shocked\add*.
\q1
\v 17 I will scatter the people when their enemies \add attack them\add*
\q2 like dust is scattered by an east wind.
\q1 And when they experience all these difficulties\f + \ft Or: disasters \f*,
\q2 I will turn my back on them \add and refuse\add* to help them."

\q
\v 15 Yet my people have forgotten me. They have made offerings to empty gods and been made to stumble in their ways;
\q Ancient pathways, to walk a path not prepared with dirt.
\q 
\v 16 To make their land a horror, an everlasting hissing!
\q Everyone who passes alongside her will shudder and shake his head!
\q
\v 17 I will disperse them before their enemies like an eastern wind!‚Äù
