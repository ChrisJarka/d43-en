\v 23 Thus he said, "As for the fourth animal, 
\q it shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, 
\q which shall be different from all the other kingdoms, 
\q and it shall devour the whole earth, 
\q and it shall trample it down, 
\q and break it into pieces.
\v 24 And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise,
\q and another shall arise after them; 
\q and he shall be
different from the former ones, 
\q and he shall conquer the three kings.
