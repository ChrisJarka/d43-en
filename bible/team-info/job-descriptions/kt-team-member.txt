====== Key Terms Team Member Responsibilities ======


==== Team Purpose ==== 

The Key Terms (KT) team will write and update the content of the KT pages. These pages will provide concise, clear explanations of important words, people, people, places, things, and phrases that require more than a brief note. 

The KT pages should present all the necessary information about the term that a translator would need to accurately represent it in his/her own language. They should also provide alternative translation suggestions as possible. In addition, the KT pages should be cross-linked with other KT pages as helpful.

The content of KT pages are not specific to any particular book. They should present the meaning of the term across the Bible. Also, they will need to occasionally be updated as the Notes teams work on new books and discover additional issues not yet covered by the KT pages.

All of the content developed will be released as open-source, unrestricted materials. No copyrighted materials should be included in their creation. It is also understood that the team agrees to have the product of their work freely distributed as open-source.


==== Member Responsibilities ====

Each member of the KT team will regularly and faithfully interact with other KT team members in the discussion area of their assigned pages, with the following in mind:

  * Be considerate and civil - we have a lot of work to do on an intense deadline
  * Be humble - the other people on your team are knowledgable
  * Be thorough - take the time to surface and discuss all important topics
  * Be willing to compromise - we will not always be unanimous in decisions, but will try to let consensus rule

Each member will agree to follow the instructions of and schedule set by the KT team leader.
