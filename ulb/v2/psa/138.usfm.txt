\c 138
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I will give you thanks with my whole heart:
\q Before the gods will I sing praises to thee.
\q
\v 2 I will worship toward your holy temple,
\q And give thanks to your name for your lovingkindness and for your truth:
\q For you have magnified your word above all your name.
\q
\v 3 In the day that I called you answeredst me,
\q You did encourage me with strength in my soul.
\q
\v 4 All the kings of the earth shall give you thanks, O Jehovah,
\q For they have heard the words of your mouth.
\q
\v 5 Yea, they shall sing of the ways of Jehovah;
\q For great is the glory of Jehovah.
\q
\v 6 For though Jehovah is high, yet has he respect to the lowly;
\q But the haughty he knows from afar.
\q
\v 7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me;
\q You will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of mine enemies,
\q And your right hand will save me.
\q
\v 8 Jehovah will perfect that which concerns me:
\q Your lovingkindness, O Jehovah, endures for ever;
\q Forsake not the works of your own hands.
