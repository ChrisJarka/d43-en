\v 23 And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
\v 24 For if you was cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and was grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
