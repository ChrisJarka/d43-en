\v 24 After he had gone, his servants came back, but they saw that the doors of the room were locked. They said, "The king must be defecating in the inner room."
\v 25 So they waited, but when the king did not open the doors of the room, after a while they were worried. They got a key and unlocked the doors. And they saw that their king was lying on the floor, dead.

\v 24 Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they
said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.
\v 25 And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the
key, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
