\v 1  We received a report that there is a person within your church who is living in sexual immorality. The report was that this was a kind of immorality that is not even tolerated among the pagans. A man has a lover who is his father's wife.
\v 2 You have been so arrogant! Rather you should have mourned, for this harms the entire church. You must put this man out of the church and take him away from you.

\v 1 We heard a report that there is sexual immorality among you, the kind of immorality that  is not even permitted among the Gentiles. The report is that one of you has a partner who is his fatherâ€™s wife.
\v 2 And you are so smug! Should you not rather  mourn? You must put away from you the one who did this.
