===== Vision & Purpose =====

//This page answers the question:// //What is the vision of unfoldingWord for this audio manual?//

The vision of unfoldingWord Audio Engineering is to serve and equip the global Church to create and distribute excellent, unrestricted audio recordings of Biblical content, especially in sub-optimal conditions. The recommendations, skills-training and tips in this manual are developed for, by and with the global Church. By openly sharing access to empowering solutions, a world-wide team of media creators can lead their own projects with skill, excellence, wisdom and longevity for their own people groups.

Today, the need for Biblical content to be accessed audibly is as significant as any time in history. As much as 80% of all people live in oral culture communities. Among people living in literate-based societies, many of them learn best, if not exclusively, by listening (aural learning). Billions of people need a solution engineered that can go the distance where traditional and modern strategies often have limited effectiveness and restrict access.

This manual, like all unfoldingWord content, is licensed CC BY-SA to make it irrevocably accessible to the global Church. By combining meaningful relationships with unrestricted resources, skills-training, advancements in recording technology, and versatile devices for offline listening and sharing, it is our belief that the global Church can work together to meet the vast need for access to Biblical content for the first time.
