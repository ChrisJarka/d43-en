\q
\v 13 In that day the beautiful virgins
\q and the young men will faint from thirst.
\q
\v 14 Those who swear by the sin of Samaria
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa the sin of Samaria \fqa* , some versions have \fqa Ashimah of Samaria. Ashimah was the name of a pagan goddess worshiped in some parts of Syria. \fqa* . 
\q and say, 'As your god lives, Dan,'
\q and, 'As the way to Beersheba exists'—
\f + \ft The Hebrew text has \fqa As the way to Beersheba exists \fqa* , where this might refer to what people going to worship Beersheba's idols might have said. However, some versions want to change the Hebrew text to read \fqa As the loved one of Beersheba lives \fqa* . Here "loved one" stands for an idol worshiped in Beersheba \fq* .
\q they will fall and never rise again."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **In that day** - "At that time" (UDB)
  * **faint** - to lose all strength
  * **by the sin of Samaria** - Here "sin" represents the false god the people worship in Samaria. AT: "by the false god of Samaria" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **As your god lives, Dan** - This is a way of making a solemn oath. The people declare that they believe the god of Dan is certainly alive to emphasize that they will certainly do what they promise to do.
  * **As the way to Beersheba exists** - This is probably a reference to the roads that pilgrims would take to Beersheba in order to worship idols there. Again, this is a way of making a solemn oath. They state that the way to Beersheba certainly exists in order to emphasize that they will certainly do what they promise to do.
  * **they will fall** - This is an idiom. AT: "they will die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
