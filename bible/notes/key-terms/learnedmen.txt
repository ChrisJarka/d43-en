====== learned men, astrologers, magicians ======

In Matthew's account of the birth of Christ these men were the "wise men" who visited the Christ child bearing gifts. They came from the East and came a long way. They were aware of the stars and were scholars. Exactly where they came from and who they were is unknown.

Acts 18 refers to Apollos as a "learned man" who taught about Jesus. He was not an astrologer or a magician.  He was a leader in the early church.
