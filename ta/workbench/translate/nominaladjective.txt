Many times the Bible uses adjectives as though they were nouns to describe a group of people.

===== Description =====

Many times the Bible uses adjectives as though they were nouns to describe a group of people.

**Reasons this is a translation issue**  Readers may think that the text is talking about one particular person when it is really talking about many people whom the adjective describes.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**The scepter of wickedness must not rule in the land of __the righteous__.**  (Psalms 125:3 ULB) \\ "The righteous" here are people who are righteous, not one particular righteous person.

**Blessed are __the meek__** (Matthew 5:5 ULB) \\ "The meek" here are people who are meek, not one particular meek person.

===== Translation Strategies =====

If your language can use adjectives as nouns and communicate the correct meaning clearly, use them. If the meaning is unclear or wrong, you might have to do something like this:

  - Use the plural form of the noun that the adjective most likely describes.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Use the plural form of the noun that the adjective most likely describes.

  * **The scepter of wickedness must not rule in the land of __the righteous__.**  (Psalms 125:3 ULB)
      * "The scepter of wickedness must not rule in the land of __righteous people__."
  * *Blessed are __the meek__** (Matthew 5:5 ULB)
      * "Blessed are __people who are meek__"
