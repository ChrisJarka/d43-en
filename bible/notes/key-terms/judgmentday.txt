====== judgment day ======


===== Definition: =====


The "judgment day" refers to a future time when God will judge every person.


    * God has made his Son, Jesus Christ, the judge for all people.
    * On judgment day, Christ will judge people on the basis of his just character.
    * On judgment day, those who believe in Jesus will go to heaven, and those who do not believe will be sent to hell.
    * This can also be translated as "judgment time" since it could refer to more than just one day.
