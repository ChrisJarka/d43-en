===== Before Translating =====

Translation of all unfoldingWord projects is done by volunteers who desire to see God's Word made available for everyone. Everyone who works on these projects must agree with and do their work in accordance with the **Statement of Faith** and must do their work according to the **Translation Guidelines**. All projects are released under an **Open License**. All three of these must be followed without exception.
