===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak to his three friends.

  * **he has broken me down on every side** - Job compares himself to a building that God is smashing. AT: "God destroys me like someone destroys a building."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and I am gone**  - "and I am completely destroyed"
  * **he has plucked up my hopes like a tree**  - Job compares his hopes to a tree that someone pulls out of the ground. AT: "What I wanted most, God has pulled up like a tree." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **He has also kindled his wrath against me** - Job compares the anger of God to a fire. AT: "God has also lit a fire of anger against me."  
  * **he regards me as one of his adversaries** - "God treats me like one of his enemies"    
  * **His troops come on together**  - Job compares the way that God is attacking him to the way an army attacks a city. AT: "God sends his soldiers to attack me." 
  * **they cast up siege mounds against me**  - This expression refers to ancient warfare when a city would have a high fortified wall around it for protection. The enemy would build a road or ramp to the top of the wall, called a siege mound, to invade the city. Job's friends are portrayed as these troops, who invade his tent.**
  * **and encamp around my tent**
