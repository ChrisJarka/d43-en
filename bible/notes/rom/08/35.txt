\v 35 Absolutely no one and nothing can cause Christ to stop loving us! That could not happen, even if someone afflicts us, or even someone harms us, or even if we have nothing to eat, or even if we do not have enough clothes, or even if we live in a dangerous situation, or even if someone will kill us.
\v 36 Such things may happen to us, just as it is written that David said to God, â€œBecause we are your people, others repeatedly attempt to kill us. They consider that we are only people to be killed, like a butcher considers that sheep are only animals to be slaughtered."

\v 36 Just as it is written,
\q "For your benefit we are killed all day long.
\q We were considered as sheep for the slaughter."
