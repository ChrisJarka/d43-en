\v 34 'Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me; he has driven me into confusion.
\q and has made me an empty pot; like a monster he has swallowed me;
\q he filled his stomach with my delicious foods; he has rinsed me out.'
\q
\v 35 The one who lives in Zion will say, 'May the violence done to me and my flesh be on Babylon.'
\q Jerusalem will say, 'May my blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The speaker speaks as if he were a woman. The woman is a metaphor for the city of Jerusalem, which in turn is a metonym for the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **he has driven me into confusion** - Possible meanings are 1) "he has caused me to be unable to think clearly" or 2) "he has crushed me."
  * **has made me an empty pot** - Babylon has taken everything from Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **like a monster** - Here Babylon is compared to a monster. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **he has swallowed me** - Jerusalem compares its destruction to being swallowed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he filled his stomach with my delicious foods** - This continues to speak of Babylon as if it were a monster. This states in another way the previous idea that Babylon has taken everything from Israel. Here "foods" represents all the good things that were there before. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he has rinsed me out** - Nebuchadnezzar took what he wanted and threw away what he did not want. The possible metaphors are that he was 1) a person rinsing old food out of a cooking pot, or 2) a man who ate all he wanted and then vomited it up again. AT: "he has vomited me up" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The one who lives in Zion** - "She who lives in Zion"
  * **The one ... to me and my flesh ... my blood** - All of these phrases refer to a woman.
  * **inhabitants of Chaldea** - "people who live in Chaldea"
