\v 9 \add I am aware that\add* some of your people meet together with those who \add follow\f + \ft Or: worship \f*\add* Satan. They claim to be Jews, but I know that they are not true Jews. They are lying. I will cause them to come to you and to bow down \add humbly\add* at your feet and to acknowledge that I love you.

\v 10 Because you have paid attention to the message to endure patiently \add when you suffered\add*, I will keep you \add safe from those who will try to harm you spiritually\add* during the period\f + \ft Or: time \f* that is about to come.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 See, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, those who say they are Jews, but are notâ€”instead, they lie. See, I will make them come and bow down before your feet. I will make them know that I have loved you.
\v 10 Because you have kept my instructions to endure, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, 
which is about to come on the whole inhabited world, to test those who live on the earth.
\v 11 I am coming soon: hold tightly to what you have, so that no one takes away your crown.
