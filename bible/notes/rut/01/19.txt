<usfm> \v 19 So the two women continued walking until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived there, everyone in the town was excited to see them. The women of the town exclaimed, "It is hard to believe that this is Naomi!" \v 20 Naomi said to them, "You should not call me Naomi any more, because it means 'pleasant.' Instead, call me Mara, because it means 'bitter.' God Almighty has made my life very bitter. \v 21 When I left here my life was full because I had a family. But Yahweh has brought me back here empty, without my family. Do not call me Naomi. Yahweh has punished me. Almighty God has caused a great tragedy to happen to me."

And the women said, "Is this Naomi?" \v 20 And she said to them, "Do not call me Naomi, call me Bitter, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. \v 21 I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty. So, why do you call me Naomi, seeing that Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?" </usfm>
