__To Do__ \\ 
Change all the examples to WEB or OEB. \\ 
Write up a sentence or two that explains each example.\\  
As time permits, find other, better examples. (Ones that are simple and clear.) \\ 
Write an explanation about what each type of figure of speech is used for.\\ 
Write  translation suggestions for dealing with each type. \\

So far some of the pages have examples from the TFT. The explanations account for the fact that the figure of speech was used in the source text (Greek or Hebrew) but in most cases it was not used in the TNT. SQ

Some of these pages have discussion sections included because I'm not sure about everything that I have written and would like some help. SQ

Some of these pages have a lot of examples. When it's time we can choose the best. It's probably good to have a few easy ones to help people get the point, along with a few difficult ones.  SQ
