====== yeast ======


===== Definition: =====


Yeast is used in baking bread or other baked goods to create gas bubbles that make the baked items less dense, or fluffy.


    * Yeast is called leaven in the Bible.
    * Jewish tradition during annual Passover celebrations does not use leaven in bread to remind the Jewish people of the rapid departure from Egypt because there was no time to wait for the bread to rise before baking.
