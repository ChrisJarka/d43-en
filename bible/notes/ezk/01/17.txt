===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they went in any direction **- "the wheels were able to go in any of the four directions that they faced"
  * **without turning** – The wheels were not like the wheel of a bicycle, which you have to turn when you want to go in a different direction. The wheels were more like balls. You can roll a ball in any direction. You do not need to turn a ball before you roll it in a different direction.
  * **As for their rims **- "This is what the rims of the wheels looked like"
  * **they were high and fearsome** – "the rims were very tall and they were awe-inspiring" or "the rims where tall and they were frightening"
  * **for the rims were full of eyes round about** – "because the rims had very many eyes that went around all four of the wheels"
