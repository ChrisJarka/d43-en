\v 7 An army that has destroyed many nations will attack you
\q2 like a lion that comes out of its den to attack other animals.

\q2 are already marching toward your land.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 A lion is coming out from his thicket 
\q and someone who will destroy nations is setting out.
\q He is leaving his place to bring horror to your land,
\q to turn your cities into ruins, where no one will live.
\q
\v 8 Because of this, wrap yourself in sackcloth, lament and wail. 
\q For the force of Yahweh's anger has not turned away from us.
\q
