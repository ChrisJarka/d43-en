<usfm>
\v 31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.
\v 32 This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.
\v 33 Nevertheless do you also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and
let the wife see that she fear her husband.
