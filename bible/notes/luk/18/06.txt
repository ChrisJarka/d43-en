\v 6 Then the Lord Jesus said, "Think carefully about what the unjust judge said.
\v 7 Even more certainly will God, who is just, bring about justice for his chosen people, who pray earnestly to him night and day! And he is always patient with them.
\v 8 I tell you, God will quickly do justice for his chosen ones! But when I, the Son of Man, come back to earth, will I still find people who believe in me?"
