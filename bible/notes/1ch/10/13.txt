\v 13 So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Jehovah, because of the word of Jehovah, which he kept not; and
also for that he asked counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire
thereby,
\v 14 and inquired not of Jehovah: therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.
