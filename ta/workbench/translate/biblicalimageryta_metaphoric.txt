====== Biblical Imagery - Master Metaphorical Patterns ======

===== Description =====


These patterns often overlay other metaphorical patterns, so they can be called master patterns.

=== ABSTRACT CONCEPTS are represented as PERSONS  ===

Sometimes abstract ideas are represented as if they were persons. This is called personification. 

>they will suck the abundance of the seas  (Deuteronomy 33:19 ULB)
The seas refers to trade with countries along the seas. The seas (or trade) is represented as a mother who gives milk to her baby.

>You teach me the path of life; abundant joy resides in your presence; delights abide in your right hand forever!" (Psalm 16:11)

In the example above joy and delight are spoken of as if they were people.

=== CONCRETE THINGS are represented as PERSONS ===

>Then let the trees in the forest shout for joy before Yahweh, (1 Chronicles 16:33 ULB)

In the example above, trees are spoken of as if they were people and could shout for joy. 

See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]

=== ABSTRACT IDEAS are represented as NOUNS  ===
Concepts that are inherently non-nouns are treated both conceptually and in the grammar as nouns.

>Above all these things, have __love__, which is the __bond__ of __perfection__. (Colossians 3:14 ULB)

In the example above, "love" and "bond" refer to actions, which are normally represented by verbs. But here they are treated as things and are represented by nouns. "Perfection" refers to a quality, and here it describes how something is done. This could be represented by an adverb, but here it is treated as a noun.  
  * "Above all these things, love one another, and doing this will bind you together perfectly."

=== PAST TENSE is used to represent events in FUTURE TIME ===

Although the past tense is normally used to refer to events that have already happened, it is also sometimes used in prophecy that tells about things that will happen in the future.

> Now all the entrances to Jericho were closed because of the army of Israel. No one went out and no one came in. Yahweh said to Joshua, "See, I have handed over to you Jericho, its king, and its trained soldiers. (Joshua 6:1 ULB)

>Therefore my people have gone into captivity for lack of understanding;
>their leaders go hungry, and their masses have nothing to drink. (Isaiah 5:13 ULB)

>For to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given; 
>and the rule will be on his shoulder; (Isaiah 9:6 ULB)

In the examples above God spoke of things that would happen in the future as if they had already happened.

>And about these people also Enoch, the seventh in line from Adam, foretold, saying, "Look, the Lord came with tens of thousands of his holy ones, (Jude 1:14 ULB)

Enoch was speaking of something that would happen in the future, but he used the past tense when he said "the Lord came."
