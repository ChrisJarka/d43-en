\c 66
\d For the Chief Musician. A song, a Psalm.
\q
\v 1 Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth:
\q
\v 2 Sing forth the glory of his name:
\q Make his praise glorious.
\q
\v 3 Say to God, How terrible are your works!
\q Through the greatness of your power shall your enemies submit themselves to thee.
\q
\v 4 All the earth shall worship thee,
\q And shall sing to thee;
\q They shall sing to your name. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 Come, and see the works of God;
\q He is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
\q
\v 6 He turned the sea into dry land;
\q They went through the river on foot:
\q There did we rejoice in him.
\q
\v 7 He rules by his might for ever;
\q His eyes observe the nations:
\q Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 8 Oh bless our God, you peoples,
\q And make the voice of his praise to be heard;
\q
\v 9 Who holds our soul in life,
\q And suffers not our feet to be moved.
\q
\v 10 For thou, O God, have proved us:
\q You have tried us, as silver is tried.
\q
\v 11 You brought us into the net;
\q You layedst a sore burden upon our loins.
\q
\v 12 You did cause men to ride over our heads;
\q We went through fire and through water;
\q But you brought us out into a wealthy place.
\q
\v 13 I will come into your house with burnt-offerings;
\q I will pay you my vows,
\q
\v 14 Which my lips uttered,
\q And my mouth spake, when I was in distress.
\q
\v 15 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fatlings,
\q With the incense of rams;
\q I will offer bullocks with goats. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 16 Come, and hear, all you that fear God,
\q And I will declare what he has done for my soul.
\q
\v 17 I cried to him with my mouth,
\q And he was extolled with my tongue.
\q
\v 18 If I regard iniquity in my heart,
\q The Lord will not hear:
\q
\v 19 But verily God has heard;
\q He has attended to the voice of my prayer.
\q
\v 20 Blessed be God,
\q Who has not turned away my prayer,
\q Nor his lovingkindness from me.
