\c 142
\d Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer.
\q
\v 1 I cry with my voice to Jehovah;
\q With my voice to Jehovah do I make supplication.
\q
\v 2 I pour out my complaint before him;
\q I show before him my trouble.
\q
\v 3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,
\q You knew my path.
\q In the way wherein I walk
\q Have they hidden a snare for me.
\q
\v 4 Look on my right hand, and see;
\q For there is no man that knows me:
\q Refuge has failed me;
\q No man careth for my soul.
\q
\v 5 I cried to thee, O Jehovah;
\q I said, You are my refuge,
\q My portion in the land of the living.
\q
\v 6 Attend to my cry;
\q For I am brought very low:
\q Deliver me from my persecutors;
\q For they are stronger than I.
\q
\v 7 Bring my soul out of prison,
\q That I may give thanks to your name:
\q The righteous shall compass me about;
\q For you will deal bountifully with me.
