===== UDB: =====

\v 11 Titus, all that I have written adds up to this: everyone is now able to know that God wishes to save them; this is his gift to them.    
    The grace of God that is able to bring salvation to every type of person has appeared.
\v 12 This saving grace from God trains us, as if we were children, to say no to the desires that are found in this world. It helps us to keep our minds balanced, to be honest, truthful, and fair to other people and to always keep God in our thoughts and actions while we live in this world.

When God gives us this gift, he teaches us to stop living like people who hate God. He also teaches us to refuse the bad things that unbelievers want, and to think in an honest manner. He also teaches us to honor God as we live in this world.
\v 13 At the same time, God teaches us to wait for what he will certainly do in the future--something that will make us very happy: Jesus the Messiah, our Savior and powerful God, will return to us in great splendor.
