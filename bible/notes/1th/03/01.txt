\v 1 As a result of that, when I could no longer endure worrying about you, I decided that Silas and I would stay behind alone in the city of Athens,
\v 2 and we sent Timothy to you. You know that he is our close associate and also works for God by proclaiming the good news about Christ. Silas and I sent him in order that he would urge you to continue to strongly trust in Christ.
\v 3 We did not want any of you to turn away from Christ in fear because of what you were suffering. You well know that God knew that others would mistreat us because of Christ.

\v 1 Therefore, when we could no longer bear it, we thought it was good to be left behind at Athens alone.
\v 2 We sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and comfort you regarding your faith.
\v 3 We did this so that no one would be shaken by these sufferings. For yourselves know that for this we have been appointed.
