\v 13 \add Some of them say that after God has enabled me to see visions\add*, I \add talk like\add* a crazy person. If \add that is so, I want you to realize that I talk that way in order to please\add* God. On the other hand, if \add you think that\add* I \add speak and act\add* wisely, \add that is good. I want you to know that I do\add* that in order to \add help\add* you.
\v 14 \add I speak and act the way I do\add* because the love that Christ \add has for people\add* influences me \add in everything that I say and do\add*. When he died, \add he suffered the punishment\add* for \add the sins of\add* all people. So, we should all \add think of ourselves as having\add* died with him, \add being as unresponsive to sinful desires as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a corpse is.
\v 15 When \add Christ\add* died for the sake of all people, he died in order that \add we believers who are alive now\add* should not conduct our lives in a way that will just \add please ourselves\add*. Instead, \add we should conduct our lives in a way that will please\add* him, \add because\add* he is the one who died for us and was raised \f + \ft Or:whom \add God\add* raised \f* to life again.

\v 13 If people think we are out of our minds because of the message we proclaim or how we live our lives, then we are out of our minds for God. But when you know us well and see how we live our lives to God's honor, then you will see that we are in our right minds, so we might serve and help you.
\v 14 The power that drives all we do is the love that Christ has for us. And our love for Christ powers everything we do for him. We are confirmed in the truthâ€”one person died for all, therefore we have died with him.
\v 15 Christ died for all. He died so that those who live because of his death should live for themselves any longer. They should live only for him who died for their sins and is raised from the dead.

\v 13 For if we are out of our minds, it is for God; or if we are in our right mind, it is for you.
\v 14 For the love of Christ compels us, because we are certain of this--that one person died for all, therefore all died.
\v 15 And Christ died for all, so that those who live should live no longer for themselves but for him who died and was raised.
