\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
\v 2 And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. So David sent by
his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And Davidâ€™s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
\v 3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Thinkest you that David does honor your father, in
that he has sent comforters to you? has not David sent his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and
to overthrow it?
