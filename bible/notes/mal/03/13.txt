<usfm>
\v 13 I, Yahweh, \add have something else\add* to say to you. You have said terrible things about me."
\p But you reply, "What terrible things have we said about you?"
\p
\v 14 \add I reply\add*, "You have said, 'It is useless for us to serve God. We have gained nothing \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* by obeying the commands that he gave to us and by trying to show the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels that we are sorry \add for the sins that we have committed\add*.
\v 15 From now on, we will say\f + \ft Or: consider \f* that those who are proud are the ones whom \add God has\add* blessed. We will say that because it seems that it is those who do evil who become rich, and that it is those who try to find out how many evil things they can do without God punishing them who are not punished.'~"

\v 13 "I, Yahweh, have something else to say to you. You have said terrible things about me.
\p But you reply, 
\pi2 'What terrible things have we said about you?'
\p
\v 14 I reply: You have said that it is useless for you to serve me. You say that you have gained nothing by obeying my commands. You say that you have gained nothing by being sorry for your sins.
\v 15 You have also decided that from now on, you will say that I like to help arrogant people. You think that it is those who do evil who become rich. You think that I do not punish those who like to see how much evil they can get away with."

\v 13 "Your words against me have been strong," says Yahweh. "But you say, 'What have we said among ourselves against you?'
\v 14 You have said, 'It is useless to serve God. What profit is it that we have kept his requirements or walked mournfully before Yahweh of hosts?
\v 15 So now we call the arrogant blessed. Evildoers not only prosper, but they even tempt God and escape.'"
