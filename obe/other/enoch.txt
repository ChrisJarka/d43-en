====== Enoch ======

===== Facts: =====

Enoch is the name of two men in the Old Testament.

  * One man named Enoch was descended from Seth. He was the father of Methuselah and the great grandfather of Noah.
  * This Enoch had a close relationship with God and when he was 365 years old, God took him to heaven without dying.
  * A different man named Enoch was a son of Cain. Some translators may prefer to spell the names of these two men a little bit differently from each other to make it clear that they were two different people.
