===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **not take his father’s wife as his own** - "not marry his father's wife." It is implied that this refers to a former wife of the father after the father has died or divorced her. It is also implied that the woman is not the father of the man. AT: "must not marry his father's former wife, even if she is not his mother." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **he must not take away his father’s marriage rights** - "and he must not remove the corner of his fathers garment." When a man and a woman marry each other, it is as though they become one person and share their nakedness. So if a son sees his father's wife when she is naked, then it is as though he sees his father naked. People often used the phrase "see someone's nakedness" as a euphemism for having sexual intimacy with someone. Possible alternate translations 1) "because that would be like seeing his father naked" or 2) "because that would be like having sex with his father." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])



  * **take away his father’s marriage rights**  - AT: "have sex with his father's wife." ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
