===== Description =====

Apostrophe is a figure of speech in which someone speaks to someone or something that he knows cannot hear him. This calls his hearers' attention to his feelings toward that person or thing. He could even speak to a thing or idea as if it were a person (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]). 

**Reason this is a translation issue** \\ 
Many languages do not use apostrophe, and readers could be confused by it.\\ 

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Come now, you who are rich, cry out loud because of the miseries coming upon you.** (James 5:1)\\ 
James wrote to the church, which was made up of poor people, as if rich people could hear him, showing his anger about what rich people were doing. 

**The man of God cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh and said, "Altar, altar, Yahweh says, ' ...  on you they will burn men's bones.' "** (1 Kings 13:2) \\
The man of God spoke as if the altar could hear him, but he really wanted the king, who was standing there, to hear him.

===== Translation Strategies =====
If apostrophe would be appropriate understood correctly in your language, consider using it. Otherwise, consider this.

  - Have the speaker express his feelings toward the thing or idea without speaking directly to it. 
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
  
1. If this way of speaking would be confusing to your people, you may preserve the meaning of the apostrophe and let the speaker continue speaking to the people that are listening to him.\\

  * **The man of God cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh and said, “Altar, altar, Yahweh says, ' … on you they will burn men's bones.' “** (1 Kings 13:2) \\
    * "The man of God said, "This is what Yahweh says __about this altar__'…  They will burn men's bones on __it__.'"

 


===== Examples from English =====
__Silly dog,__  what are you barking for now?\\ 
\\ 
__Pesky phone__, why will you not let me call?
