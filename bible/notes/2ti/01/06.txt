  * **This is the reason **- "For this reason" or "because of your sincere faith in Jesus" or "since you have a sincere faith in Jesus"
  * **I remind you **- "I am reminding you" or "I am telling you again"
  * **rekindle the gift of God in you through the laying on of my hands**  - Paul would have laid hands on Timothy conferring the Holy Spirit and a spiritual ability or gift upon him. Paul is telling Timothy to "relight" or "rekindle" that spiritual ability in his work for Christ. The picture of blowing on or fanning a bed of coals is a metaphor for spiritual abilities and gifts that Timothy had been neglecting or not using.
  * **For God **- "Because God" or "Since God"
  * **spirit of fear**  - "spirit of cowardice" - Paul is referring back to the Spirit who was conferred through the laying on of his hands, given by God, who does not impart cowardice, but power, love, and self-control.
  * **discipline**  - "moderation", "self-control" or "teaching of morality"
