\v 1 Then came near the heads of fathers’ houses of the Levites to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of
Nun, and to the heads of fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel;
\v 2 and they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah commanded by Moses to give us cities to dwell
in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.
\v 3 And the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of Jehovah, these
cities with their suburbs.
\p
\v 4 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites,
had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen

was the first lot.
\v 11 And they gave them Kiriath-arba, which Arba was the father of Anak (the same is Hebron), in the hill-country of

\v 15 and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,
\v 16 and Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs, and

\v 17 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs,
\v 18 Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.
\v 19 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
\p

\v 25 And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.
\v 26 All the cities of the families of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with their suburbs.
\p
\v 27 And to the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh
they gave Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Be-eshterah with its suburbs;

\v 40 All these were the cities of the children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families
of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.
\p
\v 41 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with
their suburbs.
\v 42 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus it was with all these cities.
\p
\v 43 So Jehovah gave to Israel all the land which he sware to give to their fathers; and they possessed it, and lived
therein.
\v 44 And Jehovah gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware to their fathers: and there stood not a man of
all their enemies before them; Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand.
\v 45 There failed not anything of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.
