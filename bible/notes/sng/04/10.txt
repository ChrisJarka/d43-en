===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The man continues to praise the woman.

  * **How beautiful is your love** - "Your love is wonderful"
  * **my sister** - This is an idiom of affection. They are not actually brother and sister. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:04:08|4:9]]. AT: "my dear" or "my darling" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my bride** - This Hebrew word can refer to a woman who is married or to one whom a man has arranged to become his son's wife. If your language has a polite word that a man would use to his wife and that has not been used yet in this book, you could use it here. Otherwise you could use any polite term a man would use with his wife. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:04:08|4:9]].
  * **How much better is your love than wine** - "Your love is much better than wine." Translat as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:01|1:2]].
  * **the fragrance of your perfume than any spice** - "the smell of your oils is better than the smell of any spice." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **fragrance ... perfume** - See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:01|1:3]].
  * **spice** - dried plants or seeds that have a good smell or taste 
  * **Your lips ... drip honey** - Possible meanings are that honey is a metaphor for 1) the sweet taste of the woman's kisses or 2) the woman's words. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **honey and milk are under your tongue** - Because "milk and honey" is a common phrase in the Bible, you should translate literally. Possible meanings are that honey is a metaphor for 1) the sweet taste of the woman's kisses or 2) the woman's words. Milk is a metaphor for luxury, owning many things that help people enjoy life. When the woman kisses the man, he enjoys life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon** - "the smell of your clothes is like the smell of Lebanon." Many cedar trees grew in Lebanon. Cedar trees smell very good, so Lebanon would have smelled sweet and fresh.
