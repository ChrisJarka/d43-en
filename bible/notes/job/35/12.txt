====== Job 35:12-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 People cry out \add for help\add*,
\q2 but God does not answer them,
\q2 because those who cry out are proud and evil people.
\q1
\v 13 It is useless for them to cry out,
\q2 because God, the Almighty One, does not pay any attention to what they say.
\q1
\v 14 So, when you complain that you cannot see God,
\q2 and you tell him that you are waiting for him \add to decide whether or not you should be punished for what you have done\add*,
\q2 God will not listen to you, either!

\q
\v 12 There they cry, but none gives answer,
\q Because of the pride of evil men.
\q
\v 13 Surely God will not hear an empty cry,
\q Neither will the Almighty regard it.
\q
\v 14 How much less when you say you behold him not,
\q The cause is before him, and you waitest for him!
