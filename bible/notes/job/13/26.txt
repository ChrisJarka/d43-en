<usfm>
\q
\v 26 For you writest bitter things against me,
\q And make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:
\q
\v 27 You put my feet also in the stocks,
\q And markest all my paths;
\q You set a bound to the soles of my feet:
\q
\v 28 Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth,
\q Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
