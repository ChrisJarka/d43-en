\c 5
\p
\v 1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven
seals.
\v 2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
\v 3 And no one in the heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon.
\v 4 And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon:
\v 5 and one of the elders says to me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has
overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof.
\v 6 And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as
though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the
earth.
\v 7 And he came, and he takes it out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.
\v 8 And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having
each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
\v 9 And they sing a new song, saying,
\pi Woryour are you to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you was slain, and did purchase to God with your
blood men of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,
\v 10 and made them to be to our God a kingdom and priests; and they reign upon the earth.
\m
\v 11 And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the
number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
\v 12 saying with a great voice,
\pi Worthy is the Lamb that has been slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and glory, and
blessing.
\p
\v 13 And every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things
that are in them, heard I saying,
\pi To him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the
dominion, for ever and ever.
\p
\v 14 And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped.
