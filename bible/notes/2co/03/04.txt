====== 2 Corinthians 03:4-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 I \add can very\add* confidently \add write these things about the work that Silas, Timothy, and I did among you, because God knows that what I write is true. We\f + \ft exclusive \f* are true workers\add* for God\add because of what\add* Christ \add has done for us\add*.
\v 5 We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, by ourselves, do not have the ability \add to do this work\add*. None of us \add apostles\add* can say, "\add I have changed the lives of these people\add*." God is the one \add who has given us this ability\add*.
\v 6 He is the one who enables us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* to be his messengers. \add He has enabled us to tell people the message\add* about the new agreement \add that he is making with them\add*. This is not a \add message about obeying all the\add* written laws \add of his old agreement that he made with the Jewish people\add*. Instead, \add it is a message about God giving us his\add* Spirit. \add Previously, God condemned people to be\add* separated from him forever \add if they did not obey his laws\add*. But by \add God's new agreement\add* his Spirit enables people to live \add eternally\add*.

\v 4 This is how we trust God, because we are joined to Christ.
\v 5 We are not able to do anything for God in our own strength, so we cannot claim to be able to. Instead, it is God who gives us all we need to serve him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 And this is the confidence that we have in God  through Christ.
\v 5 Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our adequacy is from God,
\v 6 who also qualified us to be servants of a new covenantâ€”not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
