===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 They will have an appearance of godliness, but they will say no to the power of true godliness. Do not associate with people like this,
\v 6 
 who are weighed down with many sins and those women .
because they are men who subtly persuade foolish women to let them come into their houses, and then they deceive those women so that they control what those women think. These women have been burdened with sins and they have been led to do the many evil things that they strongly desire to do are being led into many kinds of passions.
\v 7 Even though they are always wanting to learn new things, they are never able to recognize what is true.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 They will have a form of godliness, but they will deny the power of it. Turn away from these men.
\v 6 For from them are men who enter into households and captivate foolish women who are overwhelmed with sins and are led away by various desires.
\v 7 These women are always trying to learn new  things, yet they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
