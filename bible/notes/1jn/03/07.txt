\v 7 Dear children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, just as Christ is righteous.
\v 8 He who does sin is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed, so that he might destroy the works of the devil.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Dear children** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:02:01|2:1]].
  * **let no one lead you astray** - AT: "do not let anyone fool you" or "do not let anyone deceive you" (UDB)
  * **He who does righteousness is righteous, just as Christ is righteous** - AT: "He who does what is right is pleasing to God just as Christ is pleasing to God."
  * **does sin** - "continues to sin repeatedly" (UDB)
  * **is of the devil** - "belongs to the devil" or "is like the devil" (UDB)
  * **from the beginning** - This refers to the very earliest times of creations before humans first sinned. AT: "since the earliest times of creation." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the Son of God was revealed** - This can be translated with an active clause: "God revealed his Son" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the Son of God was revealed, so that he might destroy the works of the devil** - Only the Son of God can and will ultimately destroy the evil that Satan has caused. Jesus' title "Son of God" is power over Satan, so the wording "Son of God" must be retained and translated as clearly as possible in your language. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
