\q Is it not right for you to understand justice?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now listen you leaders, and rulers of the house of Israel **- Micah is denouncing the judicial leaders for lack of responsibility to those who they should be protecting.
  * **You who tear off their skin, their flesh from their bones — you who also eat the flesh of my people, and tear their skin off, break their bones, and chop them in pieces, just like meat for a pot, just like meat in a cauldron. **  -Micah is now using more explicit language to illustrate how upset God is with the leader’s treatment of those they should be protecting. . see verses 2:2, 2:8-9. (see: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
