\v 21 "Others have told you what God said to our ancestors, 'You must not kill anyone,' and, 'If you kill anyone, the judge might sentence you to die.'
\v 22 But I tell you that if you are angry with anyone, God himself will judge you. If you say to someone, 'You are worthless,' the Jewish council will judge you. If you say to someone, 'You are a fool,' God will throw you into the fire in hell.

\v 21 You have heard that it was said to them in ancient times, 'You will not kill,' and, 'Whoever kills will be in danger of
the judgment.'
\v 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of the judgment; and whoever 
says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be in danger of the Council; and whoever says, 'You fool,' will be in danger of the hell
of fire.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in 5:1.

  * **You**  - Jesus was talking to a group of people about what might happen in their individual lives.
  * **kill**  - This word could be translated as "murder."
  * **Raca**  - Raca is an expression of a rude name, like "you are worthless." (UDB)
  * **danger of the Council**  - This is talking about the group in religious leadership over the Jewish people. (UDB).
  * **fool**  - This is someone who acts stupidly.
  * "You fool," will be in danger of the hell of fire - Christ is letting them know that their righteousness does not even come close to the righteousness that is necessary to make them right with God.
