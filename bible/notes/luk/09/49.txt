\v 49 John replied to Jesus, "Master, we saw a man who was using your name to command demons to come out of people. So we told him to stop doing that, because he is not following you as part of our group."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **John answered and said**  - That is, "in answer, John said" or "as an answer, John said."
    * **Master **  - This refers to someone who has been put in charge over a group of people, and not someone who owns someone else. It is a different word than is usually translated as “Master” and does not have the same level of authority. You may want to translate it as “Boss” or “Foreman.”
    * **he that is not against you is for you - ** that is, "he that doesn't hinder you, helps you", or, "he that isn't working contrary to you is working in your favor"
