\v 10 I rejoice greatly \add and thank\add* the Lord because now, after some time, \add by sending money to me\add* you have once again shown that you are concerned about me \f + \ft euphemism \f*. Indeed, you were concerned about me \add all the time\add*, but you had no opportunity \add to show that you were concerned about me\add*.
\v 11 I am saying this not because I \add am concerned that I\add* lack things \add that I need\add*. In fact, I have learned to be content in whatever \add situation\add* I am.
\v 12 \add Specifically\add*, I know how \add to be content when\add* I do not have what I need, and I know how \add to be content when\add* I have plenty. I have learned how \add to be content\add* in any and every \add situation\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*. \add Specifically\add*, I have learned how \add to be content when\add* I have enough to eat, and I have learned how \add to be content when\add* I do not have enough to eat. I have learned how \add to be content when\add* I have plenty \f + \ft doublet \f* \add of what I need\add*, and I have learned \add how to be content when\add* I lack \add things\add*.

\v 10 I rejoice greatly and thank the Lord because now, after some time, by sending money to me you have once again shown that you are concerned about me . Indeed, you were concerned about me all the time, but you had no opportunity to show that you were concerned about me.
\v 11 I am not saying this because I am concerned that I lack things that I need. In fact, I have learned to be satisfied because I am dependent upon God, who gives me a freedom and independence from discontent.
\v 12 I am able to be needy or to have plenty. I have learned how to be satisfied in any and all circumstances. I am content when I have plenty to eat and also when I am hungry. Whether I have an abundance or need something, I know I am in God's care.
\v 13 I am able to cope with every situation because Christ makes me strong.

\v 10 I rejoice in the Lord greatly because now at last you have renewed your concern for me. Although previously you were thinking of me, there was no opportunity for you to help.
\v 11 I am not referring to my needs, for I have learned to be content in all circumstances.
\v 12 I know how to live in times of need, and I also know how to live in times of abundance. In every way I have learned the secret both to have plenty and to be hungry, both to abound and to need.
\v 13 I can do all things in him who strengthens me.
