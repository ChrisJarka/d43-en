\v 8 And Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nothing by the manifestation of his coming.
\v 9 His coming is according to the work of Satan with all power and signs and false wonders,
\v 10 and with all deceit of unrighteousness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth that they might be saved.
