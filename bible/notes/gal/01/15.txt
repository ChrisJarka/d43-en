\v 15 But God considered me good and He chose me while I was in my motherâ€™s womb, and God called me through his grace
\v 16 to reveal his Son in me that I would proclaim him among the Gentiles. I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood people about this,
\v 17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who became apostles before me, but instead I went to Arabia and then returned to Damascus.
