====== "It looks good to me." ======

As each team works through their assignment for the week, some pages will reach completion sooner than others. We would like you to help us identify when a page is "ready" for three reasons:

  - so the team leader can change its status from "draft" to "review"
  - so you will know what pages you should skip on your next pass through the materials
  - so that other team members will know which pages still need attention and can focus there

The method by which you will do this is to add a new comment in the Discussion section to the effect that, "It looks good to me." 

When you see a page marked as "It looked good to me" by one other team member, it does not mean it is finished. We would like to see a consensus among several of the team members before we change a page status from "draft" to "review."  Therefore, when you or someone else marks the page as finished, it is a **suggestion**, rather than an **indisputable fact**. 

So don't be afraid that marking a page will stop the process. And when you see that only one or two people have marked a page as finished, go ahead and check for yourself. Consensus is good.
