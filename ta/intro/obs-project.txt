===== What is Open Bible Stories? =====

==== Overview ====

Open Bible Stories ([[http://openbiblestories.com|http://openbiblestories.com]]) is a set of 50 key stories of the Bible, from Creation to Revelation, to be used for evangelism & discipleship. It is being translated as text, audio, and video so that it can be downloaded to any mobile phone, in any language, for free. This free & open visual mini-Bible is made of 600 images plus corresponding text making it easily accessible to both children and adults.

From its inception, Open Bible Stories was designed with wide-spread translation and distribution in mind. Our goal is that Biblical content be translated into every language of the world. To make this a reality, we strive to ensure that anyone, anywhere be able to start translating Open Bible Stories, today. To help facilitate this, wordings have been carefully selected that are easily translated, but also completely accurate to the Bible. We have also created a complete set of [[en:ta:intro:helps|translation helps]] which help the translator understand the exegetical, linguistic, and cultural setting of the text to help ensure a scripturally-accurate, easily-understandable translation. Several [[en:ta:intro:tools|translation tools]] that help facilitate the translation and distribution process have also been created. A series of [[en:ta:check|translation checks]] for Open Bible Stories helps to ensure the highest quality translation as well as accuracy to the Biblical text. Finally, all of the text, images, and tools are released under an [[en:ta:intro:license|open license]] which enables wide-spread collaboration and redistribution.
