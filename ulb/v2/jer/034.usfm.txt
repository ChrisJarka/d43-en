\c 34

\v 1 The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the
kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the
cities thereof, saying:
\v 2 Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus says Jehovah, Behold,
I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:
\v 3 and you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and your eyes shall
behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.
\v 4 Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah king of Judah: thus says Jehovah concerning thee, You shall not die by the
sword;
\v 5 you shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they make
a burning for thee; and they shall lament thee, saying, Ah Lord! for I have spoken the word, says Jehovah.
\p
\v 6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
\v 7 when the king of Babylon’s army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left,
against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah
as fortified cities.
\p
\v 8 The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that
were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;
\v 9 that every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, that is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that
none should make bondmen of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.
\v 10 And all the princes and all the people obeyed, that had entered into the covenant, that every one should let his
man-servant, and every one his maid-servant, go free, that none should make bondmen of them any more; they obeyed, and let them
go:
\v 11 but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought
them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
\p
\v 12 Therefore the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
\v 13 Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of
the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
\v 14 At the end of seven youars you shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that has been sold to thee, and has
served you six years, you shall let him go free from you: but your fathers listened not to me, neither inclined their
ear.
\v 15 And you were now turned, and had done that which is right in mine eyous, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor;
and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
\v 16 but you turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free
at their pleasure, to return; and you brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.
\p
\v 17 Therefore thus says Jehovah: You have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man
to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim to you a liberty, says Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and
I will make you to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth.
\v 18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, that have not performed the words of the covenant which they
made before me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof;
\v 19 the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, that
passed between the parts of the calf;
\v 20 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life; and their dead
bodies shall be for food to the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the earth.
\v 21 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that
seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, that are gone away from you.
\v 22 Behold, I will command, says Jehovah, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take
it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
