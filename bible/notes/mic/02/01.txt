\p
\v 1 Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is
in the power of their hand.
\v 2 And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man
and his heritage.
