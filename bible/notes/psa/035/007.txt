====== Psalms 035:7-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Although I did not do anything wrong to them,
\q2 they concealed a deep pit for me to fall into;
\q2 they hid a net in which they would catch me.
\q1
\v 8 Cause them to suddenly experience disaster!
\q2 Cause them to be trapped in their own nets!
\q1 Cause them to fall into the pits that they have dug for me and disappear!

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit;
\q Without cause have they digged a pit for my soul.
\q
\v 8 Let destruction come upon him unawares;
\q And let his net that he has hid catch himself:
\q With destruction let him fall therein.
</usfm>
