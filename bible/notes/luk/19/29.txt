===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Bethphage**  - Bethphage was a village on the mountain called Olivet, which is across a small valley (Kidron Valley) from Jerusalem. No one knows for sure of its exact location, but it is where Jesus started His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, so it could not have been too far away from the city.
  * **Bethany**  - Bethany is a village about 3 kilometers from Jerusalem. It was the home of Mary, Martha and Lazarus.
  * **the mount that is called Olivet**  - This is a mountain close to Jerusalem. The Kidron Valley separates it from the city. It could also be called "Olivet Mountain."
  * **colt**  - This is a young donkey.
  * **the Lord has need-** Or, "the Lord of It has need." Jesus is the God (creator) of the colt.
