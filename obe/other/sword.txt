====== sword ======

===== Definition: =====

A sword is a flat-bladed metal weapon used to cut or stab. It has a handle and a long, pointed blade with a very sharp cutting edge.

  * The blade of a sword at that time was around 60 cm to 91 cm long.
  * Some swords have two sharp edges and are called "double-edged" swords.
  * The Psalms say that a person's tongue can injure a person like a sword
  * Jesus' disciples had swords they planned to use to defend themselves. Peter used his sword to cut off the ear of the high priest's servant.
  * Both John the Baptist and the apostle James were beheaded with swords.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * A sword is used as a metaphor for God's word. God's teachings in the Bible expose people's innermost thoughts and convict them of their sin. In a similar way, a sword cuts deeply, causing pain.
  * One way to translate this figurative use would be, "God's word is like a sword, which cuts deeply and exposes sin."
  * If swords are not known in your culture, this word could also be translated with the name of another long-bladed weapon that is used to cut or stab.
  * It could be described as a “sharp weapon” or “long knife.” Some translations may decide to include a picture of a sword.
