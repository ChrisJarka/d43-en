===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "innocent" could also be translated as "not guilty" or "having done nothing wrong."
  * If possible, it is best to translate "sinless" and "innocent" differently. The term "innocent" is usually used in the context of not being guilty of something that would deserve punishment or oppression.
  * The frequently occurring idiom, "innocent blood" could be translated by a phrase that means "a person who is not guilty" or "people who did not commit any crimes" or "people who did nothing wrong to deserve being killed."
