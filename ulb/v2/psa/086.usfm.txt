\c 86
\d A Prayer of David.
\q
\v 1 Bow down your ear, O Jehovah, and answer me;
\q For I am poor and needy.
\q
\v 2 Preserve my soul; for I am godly:
\q O you my God, save your servant that trusts in thee.
\q
\v 3 Be merciful to me, O Lord;
\q For to you do I cry all the day long.
\q
\v 4 Rejoice the soul of your servant;
\q For to thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
\q
\v 5 For thou, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive,
\q And abundant in lovingkindness to all them that call upon thee.
\q
\v 6 Give ear, O Jehovah, to my prayer;
\q And listen to the voice of my supplications.
\q
\v 7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee;
\q For you will answer me.
\q
\v 8 There is none like to you among the gods, O Lord;
\q Neither are there any works like to your works.
\q
\v 9 All nations whom you have made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord;
\q And they shall glorify your name.
\q
\v 10 For you are great, and do wondrous things:
\q You are God alone.
\q
\v 11 Teach me your way, O Jehovah; I will walk in your truth:
\q Unite my heart to fear your name.
\q
\v 12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart;
\q And I will glorify your name for evermore.
\q
\v 13 For great is your lovingkindness toward me;
\q And you have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
\q
\v 14 O God, the proud are risen up against me,
\q And a company of violent men have sought after my soul,
\q And have not set you before them.
\q
\v 15 But thou, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious,
\q Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.
\q
\v 16 Oh turn to me, and have mercy upon me;
\q Give your strength to your servant,
\q And save the son of your handmaid.
\q
\v 17 Show me a token for good,
\q That they who hate me may see it, and be put to shame,
\q Because thou, Jehovah, have helped me, and comforted me.
