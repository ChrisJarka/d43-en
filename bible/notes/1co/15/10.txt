\v 10 But it is because God acted kindly toward me in ways that I did not deserve that I became what I am now. And his acting kindly toward me produced a great result \f + \ft litotes \f*, which is that I worked harder \add for Christ\add* than all the other apostles. But it was not that I \add was working with my own ability\add*. Instead, God was helping me in a way I did not deserve.
\v 11 So it does not matter whether it was I \add who was preaching or whether it was the other apostles who were preaching\add*. We all preached \add the same message\add*, and that message is what you believed.

\v 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am. And his grace which was given me was not futile; but I labored more abundantly than all of them.  Yet it was not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
\v 11 Therefore whether it is I or they, we preached and you believed.
