===== What is Translation? =====

For our purposes, translation is a process performed between different languages that involves a person (the translator) changing a text from one language into a different language.

Translating can be a literal rewording of a text from one language into another or translation can be a recreation of the author's intended meaning of the message. The difficult part of translation is to find a balance between literal translation (which we call "formal equivalence") and the intended meaning (which we call "dynamic equivalence").
