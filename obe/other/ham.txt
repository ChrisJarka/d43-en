====== Ham ======

===== Facts: =====

Ham was the second of Noah's three sons.

  * During the worldwide flood that covered the whole earth, Ham and his brothers were with Noah in the ark, along with their wives.
  * After the flood, there was an occasion where Ham was very dishonoring to his father, Noah. As a result, Noah cursed Ham's son Canaan and all his descendants, who eventually became known as the Canaanites.
