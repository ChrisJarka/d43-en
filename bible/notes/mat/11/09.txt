\v 9 So really, what kind of person did you expect to see? A prophet? Oh, yes! But let me tell you this--John is not just any ordinary prophet.
\v 10 He is the one to whom God was referring when someone wrote in the scriptures and said,
\q 'Listen! I am sending my messenger to go ahead of you to prepare the people for your coming.'

Jesus continues talking about John the Baptist.

  * **So what did you go out to see? **- This continues the rhetorical question about John the Baptist.
  * **So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you **- The plural pronoun "you" referring to the crowd in both cases.
  * **This is he **- "John the Baptist is he"
  * **he of whom it is written**  - The pronoun "he" refers to "my messenger" in the next phrase.
  * **it is written **- The implied information is that the next phrase is a quotation from Scripture.
