===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues to give a quote of what the king of Assyria says. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:10:07|10:8]])
  * **As my hand has** - "As my powerful army has" or "As I have." Here the word "my" refers to the king of Assyria.
  * **whose carved figures were greater** - During this time people believed the power of a kingdom indicated the power of the god they worshiped. The king of Assyria is saying that he can defeat Jerusalem since he has defeated other kingdoms that were more powerful than Jerusalem.
  * **just as I did to Samaria and her worthless idols** - The word "Samaria" refers to the people who lived there. And, "her" refers to the city of Samaria. Cities and nations were often described as women. Alternate translation: "just as I did to the people of Samaria and their worthless idols." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]]) 
  * **I will also do to Jerusalem and her idols** - "I will also do to the people of Jerusalem and their idols." Yahweh did not allow for the people to make images of him. This refers to the false gods the people of Jerusalem were worshiping.
