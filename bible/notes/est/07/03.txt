\v 3 Esther replied, "O king, if you are pleased with me, and if you are willing to do \add what I ask\add*, save me, and save my people. That is what I want you to do for me.
\v 4 \add It is as though\add* I and my people \add are cattle\add* that have been sold to be slaughtered. \add It is as though\add* we have been sold to people who want to completely destroy us. If we had only been sold to people to become their male and female slaves, I would not say anything, because that would have been a matter too small to bother you, the king."
\v 5 Then King Xerxes asked her, "Who is the one who would want to do such a \add terrible\add* thing? Where is he?"

\v 3 Then QueenEsther replied  "If I have found favor with you, O king, and if it please you, I ask that my life be spared,
and I beg you that you spare the lives of  my people.
\v 4 For we are sold, I and my people, to  destruction, to slaughter, and to annihilation. If we had only been sold as male and female slaves, 
 I would remain silent, for our distress would not have been sufficient to trouble the king..
\v 5 Then King Ahasuerus and said to Esther the queen," Who is he, and where is he, who dare do this."
