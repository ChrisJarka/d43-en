===== Bible Examples =====

=== Gen:01:18 ===

"God set them (lights) in the sky to give light upon the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness."

  * **to rule the day**  - This can be translated as "to direct the daytime as a ruler directs a group of people" or "to mark the times of the day" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:personification|Personification]])

=== Gal:03:07 ===

"The scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith. "

  * **foresaw**  - "predicted" or "saw before it happened." Because God made the promise to Abraham and they wrote it down before the promise came through Christ, the scripture is like someone who knows the future before it happens. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:personification|Personification]])

=== Tit:02:12 ===

"You see, the grace of God that is able to bring salvation to everyone has appeared and trains us to deny ungodliness and worldly passions and to live sensibly, righteously, and in a godly way in this age"

  * **trains us**  - This is a figure of speech that presents the grace of God as a person who trains and disciplines people to live holy lives. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:personification|Personification]])
