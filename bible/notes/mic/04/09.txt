\v 9 Now why do you cry out aloud? Is there no king in you, is your counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of you
as of a woman in travail?
\v 10 Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shall you go forth out of the
city, and shall dwell in the field, and shall come even to Babylon: there shall you be rescued; there will Jehovah redeem
you from the hand of your enemies.
