\v 18 But even in those days, says Jehovah, I will not make a full end with you.
\v 19 And it shall come to pass, when you shall say, Wherefore has Jehovah our God done all these things to us? then shall
you say to them, Like as you have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land, so shall you serve strangers in a land
that is not yours.
