\v 19 My fellow believers whom I love, you know that every one of you should be eager to pay attention to God's true message. You should not quickly speak your own thoughts, nor quickly get angry,
\v 20 because when we get angry we cannot do the righteous things that God wants us to do.


\p
\v 21 So stop doing all kinds of evil, and humbly accept the message that God planted in your inner beings, because he is able to save you if you accept his message.

\v 19 You know this, my beloved brothers. Every man must be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger,
\v 20 for the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God.
\v 21 Therefore put away all sinful filth and the evil that is everywhere, and in humility receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
