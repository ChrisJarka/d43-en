===== The Content =====

This module answers the question: What do I do to setup the content?\\
===  ===

Regarding the content that will be recorded, there are several areas of preparation needed.

**Licensing**

If you are recording open-license, CC BY-SA content, no further preparation is needed in the area of license. 

If you are recording some other type of licensed content, you will need to check and officially obtain any permission necessary to record the content from the copyright holders. unfoldingWord does not provide support or publishing for content with restrictive licensing, so this paragraph serves only to raise awareness that content with conventional copyrights cannot be legally recorded without permission from the owner, an issue sometimes misunderstood by new recordists and one that can bring about significant criminal penalties in many parts of the world, along with distrust and loss of integrity in the eyes of copyright holders.  


**Updated text**

Make sure you have the latest version of the text you plan to record.


**Copies for the team**

Be sure the members on your recording team all have an identical copy of the most up to date text, whether print or a digital version on a laptop or uW app.
