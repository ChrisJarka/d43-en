===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **to trample my courts**  - The people of Judah believed God required the elaborate sacrifices. They disrespected the temple of God because they were also worshipping idols in the temple of God in Jerusalem.
  * **meaningless offerings**  - “Offering” can be translated as “a gift to God” or “something given to God” or “something valuable that is presented to God.”  However, to God these sacrifices of animals and rituals were now meaningless. The people has made it about the rituals when God only cared about their hearts.
  * **Incense is an abomination to me**  - "incense is offensive to me". The burning of incense represents prayer and worship rising up to God from his people. But now it had become something that God hated. It had become offensive to God.
  * **new moon**  - According to the lunar calendar <font 14px line-height: 19px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>( 12 months a year)</font> , the first day of the month came with the appearance of the new moon.
  * **sabbath assemblies**  - The seventh day of the week also known as the day of rest created by God for rest and worship. They went to the temple to worship God.
