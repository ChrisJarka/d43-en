\p
\v 14 The great day of Yahweh is near! Near and quickly hastening!
The sound of the day of Yahweh will be that of a warrior crying bitterly!
\v 15 That day will be a day of fury, a day of distress and anguish, a day of storm and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and billowing darkness!
[["Billowing darkness" is a bit unusual, but I wanted something that captured both the connotation of cloudiness and darkness better than "thick". Suggestions?]]
\v 16 It will be a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fortified cities and the high battlements!
