\v 36 Yahweh said to me, â€œSon of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? So present to them their disgusting actions,
\v 37 since they have committed adultery, and since there is blood in their hands! They have committed adultery, with their idols and they have even passed their 
sons whom they bore for me through the fire to be consumed!

  * **there is blood in their hands** - The word "blood" refers to death.  It is in their hands because they are responsible for the deaths.  It is like they have blood on their hands because they killed someone. AT: "people have died because of them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **even passed their sons whom they bore for me through the fire** - Yahweh says his sons were passed through fire to refer to them being killed and burned as a sacrifice to idols.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
