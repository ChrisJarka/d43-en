<usfm>
\v 16 So I said this to the people in other nations,
\q2 and also announced it in Jerusalem,
\q1 "Yahweh says that an army is coming to Jerusalem from far away;
\q2 they will shout a battle cry against the cities of Judah.
\q1
\v 17 They will set up tents around Jerusalem like people set up temporary shelters around a field at harvest time.
\q2 That will happen because the people of Judah have rebelled against me.
\q1
\v 18 You will be punished very severely;
\q2 it will be as though a sword has stabbed your hearts.
\q1 But you are causing those things to happen to you
\q2 because of the evil things that you have done."


\q1

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Make the nations think about this: See, announce to Jerusalem that besiegers are coming from a distant land to shout in battle against the cities of Judah.
\v 17 They will be like the watchmen of a cultivated field against her all around, since she has been rebellious against me—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\v 18 and your conduct and your deeds have done these things to you. This will be your punishment. How terrible it will be! It will strike your very heart.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **besiegers are coming** - Besiegers are soldiers who surround a city in order to keep the people in the city from being able to get supplies of food and water.
  * **They will be like the watchmen of a cultivated field against her all around** - Carefully guarding a city to keep people from going in and out is spoken of as if they are carefully watching a field to keep people from stealing from it. AT: "they will guard Jerusalem carefully like watchmen who carefully guard a cultivated field" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **against her all around** - The word "her" refers to Jerusalem. Jerusalem was often spoken of as if it were a woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **she has been rebellious against me** - The word "she" refers to Jerusalem and represents the people of Jerusalem. The word "me" refers to Yahweh. AT: "the people of Jerusalem have been rebellious against me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **your conduct and your deeds have done these things to you** - Here "conduct" and "deeds" are spoken of as if they are people that could do things. These abstract nouns can be expressed with the phrase "what you have done." AT: "These things are happening to you because of what you have done" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **It will strike your very heart** - Here "heart" probably refers to the emotions, and "strike your very heart" probably refers to causing them to suffer terribly. AT: "It will be as if it strikes your very heart" or "It will cause you to suffer terrible anguish" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
