===== Description =====

Some languages have more than one form of “we”: an **exclusive** form that means "I and someone else but not you" and an "inclusive" form that means "I and you." 

**Reason this is a translation issue** - The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. Like English, these languages do not have separate exclusive pronouns. Translators whose language has separate exclusive pronouns will always need to be careful whenever they read words “we” “us” and “ours” in English, Hebrew, or Greek. They will need to know whether they should use the pronoun that includes the person being spoken to or the pronoun that excludes the person being spoken to. 

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Forgive __us__ __our__ sins** (Luke 11:4) \\ 
God has no sins to forgive; so languages that have exclusive forms of “we” and “us” would use the exclusive forms in this verse.

**__we__ have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us** (1 John 1:2) \\ 
John is telling people who have not seen Jesus what he and the other apostles have seen. So languages that have exclusive forms of “we” and “us” would use the exclusive forms in this verse.
