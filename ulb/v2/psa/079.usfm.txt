\c 79
\d A Psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 O God, the nations are come into your inheritance;
\q Your holy temple have they defiled;
\q They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
\q
\v 2 The dead bodies of your servants have they given to be food to the birds of the heavens,
\q The flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth.
\q
\v 3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
\q And there was none to bury them.
\q
\v 4 We are become a reproach to our neighbors,
\q A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us.
\q
\v 5 How long, O Jehovah? will you be angry for ever?
\q Shall your jealousy burn like fire?
\q
\v 6 Pour out your wrath upon the nations that know you not,
\q And upon the kingdoms that call not upon your name.
\q
\v 7 For they have devoured Jacob,
\q And laid waste his habitation.
\q
\v 8 Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers:
\q Let your tender mercies speedily meet us;
\q For we are brought very low.
\q
\v 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name;
\q And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your nameâ€™s sake.
\q
\v 10 Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God?
\q Let the avenging of the blood of your servants which is shed
\q Be known among the nations in our sight.
\q
\v 11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee:
\q According to the greatness of your power preserve you those that are appointed to death;
\q
\v 12 And render to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom
\q Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
\q
\v 13 So we your people and sheep of your pasture
\q Will give you thanks for ever:
\q We will show forth your praise to all generations.
