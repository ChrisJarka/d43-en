===== Mobile Phones =====

//This page answers the question:// //How are mobile phones used?//

A significant amount of writing would be needed to accurately capture the impact and potential of mobile phones across the world for their ability to receive and play media content. Mobile phones:

  * are not limited to the infrastructure of electrical grids, telephone lines or internet.
  * are by far the most common personal electronic device capable of playing audio.
  * most can accept a microSD card.
  * can receive or send files by a built-in short range radio signal called Bluetooth.
  * many can connect to local WIFI networks to send or receive data.
  * many are capable of audio and video playback.

It is certainly an incredibly powerful tool for listening to audio resources and sharing them with others. With billions of mobile devices already owned and used by people across the world, they are extremely cost effective for listening to audio content (assuming content is in the correct format for the type of phone and the license permits distribution and sharing).

For all of the benefits of smart and basic mobile phones, there are also many misconceptions and limitations that may not be obvious depending on your own experience in your own cultural context. Below are some examples:

  * Not every person, or even every family has a mobile phone.
  * Not every person is familiar with how to read and navigate digital menus on a mobile phone.
  * Most people do not have smartphones and cannot make use of smartphone apps.
  * Many people do not have ready access to electricity to recharge their mobile phone regularly, which means that using it as an audio player depletes the valuable battery life rapidly.
  * Many phones do not have a quality built-in speaker for listening with a small group of people or while working in the field, for example.
  * Many phones do not have menus that allow for fast, easy navigation around larger audio resources, such as OBS, NT's or Full Bibles. This is especially true for people less skilled with technology.
  * For people that young, old, blind, disabled or are among the 1 billion non-readers, it may be very challenging or impossible to use a mobile device without someone else operating it for them.
  * Personal mobile phones are not usually shared or given away to other people or other communities in the way that a Bible or audio Bible player is shared or given away.

It is important to realize that most of the people who historically and presently do not have good access to Biblical content in their language are also unlikely to be able to access content through smartphone apps or internet streaming. It is easy to make an incorrect assumption of which technology best fits the local needs if decisions are based on your own cultural experience or on the marketing and advertising of other ministries.
