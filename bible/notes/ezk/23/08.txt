\v 8 For she had not left behind her whoredom from Egypt, since they laid with her from the time of her youth. They fondled the nipples of her 
virginity and poured out their whoredom upon her.
\v 9 Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians for whom she lusted!
\v 10 They uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and daughters and slew her with the sword, so she became shameful to women 
when they made judgment against her.
