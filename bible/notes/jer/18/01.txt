\c 18
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh and said,
\v 2 “Arise and go out to the potter’s house, for I will make you hear my word there.”
\v 3 So I went out to the potter’s house, and behold! He was doing his work on the potter’s wheels.
\v 4 But the object that he was making of clay was ruined in the potter’s hand, so it turned and made another vessel according to what seemed good in the eyes of the potter to do.
