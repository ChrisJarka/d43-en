    * **for a sign which is spoken against**  - The birth of the Savior through a virgin birth was a miracle, which would be denied as being possible or effective.
    * **a sword will pierce your own soul**  - This is a large broad sword perhaps one meter long. The word can also mean "a strong grief."
