===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **what had been said to them**  - That is, "what Mary and Joseph had been told" or, "what the angel told Mary and Joseph."
    * **this child**  - That is, "the baby."
    * **treasuring them in her heart**  - That is, "carefully remembering them" or, "joyfully remembering them." A treasure is something that is very valuable or precious. Mary considered the things she was told about her son to be very precious. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]])
    * **treasuring them in her heart**  - The Greek words used show a continuing past action (imperfect). This may suggest Mary guarded what she knew about Jesus while she was thinking about what the shepherds said. Perhaps she was reflecting with wonder or amazement about what God was doing.
    * **returned**  - That is, "went back to the fields where their sheep were."
