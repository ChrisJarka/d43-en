\v 18 While Jesus was there, several men brought to him a man who was paralyzed. They were carrying the man on a sleeping pad and tried  to bring him into the house to lay him down in front of Jesus.
\v 19 But they were not able to bring him in because there was such a large crowd of people in the house, so they went up the outside steps onto the roof. Then they removed some of the tiles from the roof to make an opening. They lowered the man on his sleeping pad through the opening into the middle of the crowd and put him down right in front of Jesus.

\v 18 Now some men came, carrying on a mat a man that was paralyzed, and they looked for a way to bring him inside in order to lay him down in front of Jesus.
\v 19 And not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the crowd, they went up to the housetop, and let the man down through the tiles on his mat into the midst of the people, right in front of Jesus.
