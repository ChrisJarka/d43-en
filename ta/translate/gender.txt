====== Gender Notations ======

The English language makes a distinction in pronouns between male, female and neutral nouns.

"Whomever" is neither masculine nor feminine. The same is true for 'it'; however, it is not a word English ever uses for people.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

The author followed the natural grammatical pattern of his own language, only making such distinctions when he wants to make a deliberate contrast. The translator should also follow the natural grammatical pattern of the Target Language.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Matt 7:24  Therefore, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: (King James Version)

Matt 7:24 <font 14px/arial,helvetica,sans-serif;;inherit;;rgb(0, 0, 0) text-transform: none; line-height: 24px; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; word-spacing: 0px; float: none; display: inline !important; white-space: normal; widows: 1; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;>â€œAnyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock. (New Living Translation)</font>

In this case, the original Greek word for man was 'aner'.  Some English translators have translated it person; however, the gender neutral Greek term was 'anthropos'.  'Aner' had the connotation of male gender.

===== Examples from English =====
