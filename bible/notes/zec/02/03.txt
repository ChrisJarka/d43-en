\v 3 Then the angel who had been talking to me started to leave, and another angel walked toward him.
\v 4 The second angel said to him, "Run and tell that young man with the surveyor's line: some day there will be very many people and livestock in Jerusalem, so they will not all be able to live inside the city walls; many will live outside the walls in the open country.

\v 4 The second angel said to him, "Run and speak to that young man; say,
\q 'Jerusalem will sit in the open country
\q because of the multitudes of men and beasts within her.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **another angel went out to meet him** - This angel is a new participant who has not appeared before this verse. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]])
  * **The second angel said to him** - "The second angel said to the angel who had talked with me"
  * **Jerusalem will sit in the open country ... beasts within her** - The phrase "will sit in the open country" translates a word that refers to a city that has no walls. There will be so many inhabitants in the city that it will be too large to have walls around it. AT: "Jerusalem will not have walls around it ... beasts within the city" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **I ... will become for her a wall of fire around her** - People built walls around their cities for protection. Here Yahweh speaks of protecting Jerusalem as if he himself were a wall of fire around the city. AT: "I ... will protect the city, like a wall of fire around it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:zec:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
