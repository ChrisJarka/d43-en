\v 4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scoll, at the dictation of Jeremiah, all the word of Yahweh that he spoken to him.
\v 5 Next Jeremiah commanded Baruch and said, â€œI am imprisoned; and I cannot go to the house of Yahweh.
\v 6 So you go and read from the scroll that you wrote from my mouth, the words of Yahweh, into the ears of the people in the house of Yahweh on the day of the fast, and also 
into the ears of all of Judah that come from their cities. Proclaim them!
