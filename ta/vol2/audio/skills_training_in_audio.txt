===== Skills-training =====

This module answers the question: //What is the skills training approach to audio?//\\
==  ==

Skills in audio are perhaps the most valuable, yet underrated asset in any project. Gaining, sharpening and maintaining skills takes a degree of effort and time investment. However, for a recordist working toward excellence, there is great joy and appreciation for learning, strengthening and improving skills. In fact, a wise recordist not only enjoys learning, but sees it as an important, continual process.  

Too often hope that there is a quick substitute for skills – expensive, sophisticated equipment. In reality, more expensive equipment is typically more challenging to use properly, especially by people that never gained adequate skills training. Also, expensive equipment typically means increased complexity in the recording setup, which works against the principles discussed in the Simplicity module.

Another frequent misconception is that “IT” or “Tech” skillsets are an automatic substitute for audio/media creation skillsets. Perhaps this hope comes from the casual observation of “technology” being used and the need to know where to connect cables. What is missing from this observation is that an audio recording is a creative process, not a mechanical or technical process. Technology is used in nearly every field of work in modern society. But no one would consider the skillset of a surgeon to be replaceable by an “IT” person simply because the surgeon uses technology in her work.

The approach that has strength for the dynamic, interpersonal creative process of audio recording is anchored in skills, not equipment. Skills know what to do when the equipment fails. Skills know what to do when troubleshooting is needed. Skills will know what to do when the equipment is working fine but the recording is not coming together properly. Skills know how to adapt to the best alternative solution. Skills are sensitive to the dynamics of the creative process, hour by hour. No piece of equipment can do these things and a technical understanding of the mechanics is not sufficient. 

Because skills training is so important, much of the content of this open-source Audio Handbook is dedicated to skills training and essential audio principles. Our reliance must be on skills, not equipment.
