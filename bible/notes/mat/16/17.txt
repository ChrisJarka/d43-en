\v 17 Then Jesus said to him, "Simon, son of Jonah, God is pleased with you. What you just said--no human has revealed this to you. Instead, it was my Father who lives in heaven who has revealed this to you.
\v 18 I will also tell you this: You are Peter, which means 'rock.' You will be the support for the group of those who believe in me, like a large rock supports a great building. And even death will not be strong enough to destroy it."

not prevail against it.
