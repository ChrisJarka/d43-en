===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 No one will bring food to comfort those who are mourning, not even if it is their father or their mother \add who has died\add*. No one will give them a cup \add of wine\add* to cheer them up.
\p
\v 8 And do not go to into the houses where people are feasting. Do not eat or drink anything with them.
\v 9 \add I want you to do this\add* because this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, say: 'While you are still alive and seeing it happen, I will cause there to be no more singing and laughing in this land. There will be no more joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides.'

<usfm>
\v 7 neither shall men break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them
the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
\v 8 And you shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.
\v 9 For thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and
in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
