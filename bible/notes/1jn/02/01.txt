\v 1 My little children, these things write I to you that you may not sin. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
\v 2 and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
\v 3 And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
