====== Exclusive ======


**Exclusive language is when somebody excludes somebody else through the words that they use.  ****The pronoun is exclusive if it does not include the person being spoken to. ** 
**Example from English ** 


    * Ed and I are going out for ice cream. Do you want to come with __us__?


//This example uses the word __us__  to refer to a specific group of people not including the person being spoken to.//


**Example from the Bible ** 


    * My noble friend Theophilus, many people saw the things that Jesus did while he was with __us__, from the time when he started his ministry. They served God by teaching people the message about the Lord Jesus. Many of those who heard what they taught wrote down for us accounts of the things that Jesus did from the time when he began his ministry. Luke 1 1-2 (TFT)


//This example uses the word __us__  which means a separate group. In verse 1:1 __us__  means those people that were physically with Jesus when Jesus was on earth.//
