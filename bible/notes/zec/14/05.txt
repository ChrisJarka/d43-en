===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Then you will flee by the valley of my mountain, for the valley of the mountain shall reach to Azel. You will flee from them just as you fled from 
the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah. Then Yahweh my God will come, and all the holy ones with him! 
[A couple of things on this verse. First, I made the mountain reference singular to reflet the Mount of Olives. I also opted to go with a third person pronoun on the final "you/him" since while there is a vocative aspect to the closing statement, but the primary intent seems to be descriptive to the audence of the oracle.]
