\v 10 And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast:
and the door was shut.
\v 11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
\v 12 But he answered and said, Verily I say to you, I know you not.
\v 13 Watch therefore, for you know not the day nor the hour.
