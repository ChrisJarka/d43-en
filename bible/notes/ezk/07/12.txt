\q
\v 12 The time is coming; the day has drawn near. Let not the buyer rejoice, 
\q nor the seller mourn, since my anger is upon the entire multitude!
\q
\v 13 For the seller will never return to that which is sold for as long as they live, 
\q since the vision is against the entire multitude: they will not return, 
\q for no man living in his sin will be strengthened!
</usfm>
