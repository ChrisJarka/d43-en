\b
\q1
\v 15 These prophets and priests shout, "Stay away from us!
\q2 Do not touch us!"
\q1 So the prophets and priests have fled from Israel,

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 Those prophets and priests now wander like blind men in the streets. They are defiled by that blood
\q so no one is able to even touch their clothes.
\q
\v 15 "Flee! Unclean," these prophets and priests cry out. "Flee, flee! Do not touch us!"
\q So they wander to other lands, but even the Gentiles say, "They can no longer live here as foreigners."
