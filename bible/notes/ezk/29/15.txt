\v 15 It will be the least important of all the nations; it will never again be greater than the nearby countries. I will cause Egypy to be very weak, with the result that they will never again rule over other nations.
\v 16 When that happens, \add the leaders of\add* Israel will no longer be tempted to ask Egypt to help them. Egypt wIll be punished, and that will cause the Israelite people to not forget that they previously sinned by trusting that Egypt could help them. And the people of Israel will know that I, Yahweh the Lord, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*."

\v 15 It will be the lowliest of the kingdoms and it will not be lifted up any more among the nations and I will diminish them so they will no longer rule over nations.
\v 16 and they will no longer be an object of confidence for the house of Israel, bringing remembrance of iniquity when their faces turn after Egypt. Then they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh!’”
