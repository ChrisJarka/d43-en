Paul now talks about the use of the gifts of the Spirit but especially the gift of speaking in an unknown language when used in church services.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

The Church is like a body. There are many different parts with different functions but all of them are necessary. Each part has empathy and concern for all the other parts, even those that seem less important.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]: The Church is like a body because it has many different parts each with a different but important function.
Experiencing the same Holy Spirit in our lives is like “drinking of one Spirit” because we all experience it.
