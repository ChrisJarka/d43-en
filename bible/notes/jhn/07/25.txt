\v 25 Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying, "This is the man they are trying to put to death!
\v 26 He is saying these things publicly, but the religious authorities are not saying anything to oppose him. Is that because they have decided that he is truly the Christ?
\v 27 But he cannot be the Christ, because we know where this man came from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from."

\v 25 Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
\v 26 And lo, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?
\v 27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knows whence he is.
