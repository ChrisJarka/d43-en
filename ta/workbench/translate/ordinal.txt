====== Ordinal Numbers ======


This module answers the question: What are ordinal numbers and how can I translate them?\\ 
In order to understand this module, it would be good to read

Ordinal numbers are numbers that tell either the position of something in a list or the order in which things happen. Some languages do not have special numbers that do these things. \\

**This was an evening and morning, the __first__ day.** (Genesis 1:5) \\ 
**This was an evening and morning, the __second__ day.** (Genesis 1:8) 


===== Description ===== 
Ordinal numbers are numbers that tell either the position of something in a list or the order in which things happen. 

**The __first__ lot went to Jehoiarib, the __second__ to Jedaiah, the __third__ to Harim, the __fourth__ to Seorim, … the __twenty-third__ to Delaiah, and the __twenty-fourth__ to Maaziah.** (1 Chronicles 24:7-18) \\
People tossed lots and one went to each of these people in the order given.

**…__first__ be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.** (Matthew 5:24) \\ 
Jesus was telling people that they needed to be reconciled to their brother before they offered their gift to God.
=== Ordinal Numbers in English === 

Most ordinal numbers in English simply have  "-th" added to the end.  \\

^Numeral ^Number ^Ordinal Number^ 
|4 |four |fourth| 
|10 |ten |tenth|
|100 |one hundred |one hundredth|
|1000 |one thousand |one thousandth|
 
Some ordinal numbers in English do not follow that pattern. \\ 
^Numeral ^Number ^Ordinal Number^  \\ 
|1 |one |first| 
|2 |two |second|
|3 |three |third|
|5 |five |fifth|
|12 |twelve |twelfth|
 
**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages do not have special numbers for showing the order of items in a list. There are different ways to deal with this. 
 
===== Examples from the Bible =====
Ordinal numbers are used in the Bible to tell the position of something in a list, to tell the order in which thing happened and the order of importance of the items. \\ 

A list:
**You must place in it four rows of precious stones. The __first__ row must have a ruby, a topaz, and a garnet. The __second__ row must have an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.  The __third__ row must have a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.  The __fourth__ row must have a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper. They must be mounted in gold settings.**  (Exodus 28:17-20)
This describes four rows of stones. The first row is probably be the top row, and the fourth row is probably the bottom row.
 
Order in which things happened:
**This was evening and morning, the first day.** (Genesis 1:5)

Order of importance: 
**He will have the authority of the third highest ruler in the kingdom.** (Daniel 5:7)



===== Translation Strategies =====
If your language has ordinal numbers and using them would give the right meaning, consider using them. If not, here are some strategies to consider:
  - When translating a list, tell the total number of items, and then use "one" with the first item and "another" with the rest.  
  - When telling the order in which things occurred  tell what happened first and then say "then" or "after that." 
  - When translating the order of importance say the first one is "most important"  then the next "is next important" or "is just less important than" the most important, and so on.
 
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ===== 
1. When translating a list, tell the total number of items, and then use "one" with the first item and "another" with the rest. 
  * **The first lot went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,  the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, … the twenty-third to Delaiah,  and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.**  (1 Chronicles 24:7-18)
    * "There were twenty-four lots. __One lot__ went to Jehoiarib, __another__ to Jedaiah, __another__  to Harim,…  __another__ to Delaiah, __and the last__ went to Maaziah." 
  
2. When telling the order in which things occurred  tell what happened first and then say "then" or "after that." 
  -  Use the word "number" along with the number. \\ 
  * **The name of the __second__ river is Gihon.** (Genesis 2:13) 
    * "The name of river __number two__ is Gihon." Genesis 2:13 
 
2. Tell the total number of items, and then use "one" with the first item and "another" or "the next" with the rest.  
  * **The first lot went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,  the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, … the twenty-third to Delaiah,  and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.**  (1 Chronicles 24:7-18)
    * "There were twenty-four lots. __One lot__ went to Jehoiarib, __another__ to Jedaiah, __another__  to Harim,…  __another__ to Delaiah, __and the last__ went to Maaziah." 
    * "They cast 24 lots. The lots went to Jerhoiarib, Jedaiah, Harim, Seorim, … Delaiah, and Maaziah."
 
3.   When translating the order of importance say the first one is "most important"  then the next "is next important" or "is just less important than" the most important, and so on.
  * **The first lot went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,  the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, … the twenty-third to Delaiah,  and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.**  (1 Chronicles 24:7-18)
