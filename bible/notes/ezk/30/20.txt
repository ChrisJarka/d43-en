\v 20 Then it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 21 “Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and behold! It is not bound up to receive medicine and to set a bandage to bind it, so it will not be strong enough to grasp a sword.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then it came to pass**  - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **in the eleventh year** - It is implied that this is the eleventh year after king Jehoiachin went to Babylon. Alternate translation: "in the eleventh year after king Jehoiachin went to Babylon." About three thousand people from Judah, probably including Ezekiel, went to Babylon with Jehoiachin.
  * **broken the arm of Pharaoh**  - "broken the power of Pharaoh" or "broken the control of Pharaoh". (See: Metaphor).
  * **Behold**  - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **It is not bound up to receive medicine and to set a bandage to bind it** - This phrase is used in reference to the metaphor of the broken arm. Pharaoh's power will not be restored.
  * **so it will be not be strong enough** - The "it" here is the broken arm. Because the wound will not be bandaged, it will not be healed and capable of grasping a sword.
