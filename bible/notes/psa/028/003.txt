<usfm>
\q
\v 3 Draw me not away with the wicked,
\q And with the workers of iniquity;
\q That speak peace with their neighbors,
\q But mischief is in their hearts.
\q
\v 4 Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings:
\q Give them after the operation of their hands;
\q Render to them their desert.
\q
\v 5 Because they regard not the works of Jehovah,
\q Nor the operation of his hands,
\q He will break them down and not build them up.
\b
