\v 28 When Jesus had come to the other side and to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him; they were coming out of the tombs and were very violent, so that no traveler could pass that way. 
\v 29 Behold, they cried out and said, "What have we to do with you, you Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the set time?"
