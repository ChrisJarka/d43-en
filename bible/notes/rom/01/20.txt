\v 20 \add People\add* cannot see what God is like. But ever since he created the world, by means of what he created he has clearly revealed what he is like. He has made clear to everyone that he has always been able to do very powerful deeds. \add Therefore, we should recognize that\add* he is God, \add completely different from all that he created\add*. So no one has a basis for saying\add , "We never knew about God\add*."
\v 21 Although \add the non-Jews\add* knew what God \add is like\add*, they did not honor him as God, nor did they thank \add him for what he had done\add*. But instead, they began to think foolish \add things about him\add*, and they became unable to understand \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add what he wanted them to know\add*.

\v 20 For the unseen things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things created, even his everlasting power and divine nature, in order for them to be without excuse.
\v 21 Because, knowing God, they did not glorify him as God, nor give thanks, but became foolish in their thoughts, and their senseless heart was darkened.
