===== Why =====

Jesus commanded his disciples to make disciples of EVERY people group:

<blockquote>"Jesus came to them and spoke to them and said, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations. Baptize them into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to obey all the things that I have commanded you. And see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.” -Matthew 28:18-20 (ULB)</blockquote>

We have the promise that one day representatives from EVERY language will be in heaven:

<blockquote>“After these things I saw, and behold, there was a great crowd, which no one was able to number, out of every nation, tribe, people, and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. ” -Revelation 7:9 (ULB)</blockquote>

Having the WORD OF GOD in one's heart language is so important:

<blockquote>"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ." -Romans 10:17 (ULB)</blockquote>

Why do we do what we do?

The unfoldingWord project exists because every people group deserves to have the Word of God in their language. To this end we seek to make disciples of all nations by helping to provide **unrestricted biblical content in every language of the world**.
