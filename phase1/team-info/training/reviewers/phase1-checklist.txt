====== Phase 1 Reviewer Checklist ======

Before publishing Phase 1 tN's, the reviewer should refer to the topics below.

==== Notes to Remove ====

  * Remove tN's that state information that is plainly obvious.

  * Remove tN's that are adequately clear in the UDB.

  * Remove tN's with commentary, devotional, or teaching content that does not directly help with the process of translation.

  * Remove Important Words that are not found in the ULB.


==== Notes to Correct ====

  * Correct the formatting of notes.

  * Correct tN's that are wrong (e.g., saying a plural is singular).

  * Correct Important Terms that are not correctly linked, or that point to the wrong pages.

  * Correct Translation Academy (tA) links that are not formatted correctly, or that point to the wrong pages ([[:en:bible:team-info:training:reviewers:talinks]]).

  * Simplify wording of tN's where possible.

  * Make sure that figures of speech are correctly identified and explained according to the patterns in [[:en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:quick-reference-notes]].

  * Verify that the alternate translation suggestions in the notes are "direct replacements" for the text if possible.


==== Notes to Add ====

  * Add __brief__ tN's for important issues that are not addressed in the tN's.

  * Add notes to indicate significant optional meanings for phrases, if not in the tN's.

  * Add links to significant Important Terms that are not already linked.

  * Add links to important tA topics that are not already included.


==== Communication with Teams ====

  * Notify the Notes Manager if there are recurring or important errors or omissions in the notes that the notes team needs to correct.

  * Notify the KT Team if there are changes needed to content of terms, or terms that should be added or removed.

  * Notify the Text Team of issues or concerns with the ULB and UDB texts.

  * Discuss with the Review Team any issues that might affect the work of other reviewers, or topics where they might be able to offer guidance.
