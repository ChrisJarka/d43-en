<usfm>
\v 20 In that day men will  throw away to the moles and bats their idols of silver and of gold, that they have been made for themselves to worship,
\v 21 to go into the caves of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake mightily the earth.
\v 22 Stop  trusting in  man, whose life breath is in his nostrils; for why should  he be honored?
