\v 9 When that happens, in those nations to which you have been forced to go, those of you who have escaped death will think about me. You will remember that I was very grieved because of your turning away from me in your affections, and instead  very much desired to worship your idols. You will hate yourselves because of the evil and detestable things that you have done.
\v 10 And you will realize that I, Yahweh, have punished you. You will realize that when I threatened to punish you, I surely intended  to do that.

\p
\v 8 But I will preserve a remnant among you and there will be some that escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered
throughout the countries.
\v 9 Then those who escape will remember me among the nations where they will be held captive, that I was aggrieved by their
promiscuous heart that turned away from me, and by their eyes that whored after their idols. Then they will show loathing on their face
for the wickeness which they have committed with all their abominations.
\v 10 So they will know that I am Yahweh. I did not speak in vain that I bring this evil to them.
