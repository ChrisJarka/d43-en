\v 14 Now listen to me! It is time for me to come to you for a third \add visit. When I come\add*, I \add still\add* will not insist that you \add pay me for my work\add*, because I do not want \add any of\add* your \add money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*! What I want is for you \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to love and appreciate me\add*. It is not \add normally the duty of\add* children to save \add money to provide for the needs of\add* their parents. Instead, it \add is the duty of\add* parents to \add provide\add* for their children \f + \ft metaphor \f*. In the same way, \add it is not your duty to provide for me. Instead, it is my duty to provide spiritual help for you because you are my spiritual children\add*.
\v 15 So, on my part, \add as a good parent would do\add*, I will be very happy to use everything that I have, and do everything that I possibly can, \add in order to help you\add*. And because I love you very much, I will be very disappointed if \add you\add* do not love me a little bit, too.\f + \ft Or: will \add you\add* not love me a little bit, too? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 14 Now listen to me! It is time for me to come to you for a third visit. When I come, I still will not insist that you pay me for my work, because I do not want any of your money .What I want is for you  to love and appreciate me. It is not normally the duty of children to save money to provide for the needs of their parents. Instead, it is the duty of parents to provide for their children.  In the same way, it is not your duty to provide for me. Instead, it is my duty to provide spiritual help for you because you are my spiritual children.
\v 15 So, on my part, as a good parent would do, I will be very happy to use everything that I have, and do everything that I possibly can, in order to help you. And because I love you very much, I will be very disappointed if you do not love me a little bit, too.

\v 14 Behold, I am ready to come to you a third time, and I will not be a burden; for I do not want what is yours--I want you; for the children should not save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
\v 15 And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?
