\v 1 And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saulâ€™s son,
delighted much in David.
\v 2 And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to yourself in
the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:
\v 3 and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and
if I see aught, I will tell thee.
