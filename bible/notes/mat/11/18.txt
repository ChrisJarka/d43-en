\v 19 \add In contrast\add*, \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, eat \add the same\add* food and drink \add wine as other people do\add*. But you \add reject me\add*, saying, 'Look! \add This man\add* eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax collectors and \add other\add* sinners!' But people \add who really think about\add* what \add John\add* and I have done will realize that what we do is truly wise \f + \ft metaphor, personification \f*."

\v 18 I say this because you are dissatisfied with both John and me! When John came and preached to you, he did not eat good food and did not drink wine, like most people do. But you rejected him and said, 'A demon is controlling him!'
\v 19 I, the Son of Man, was not like John. I eat the same food and drink wine as other people do. But you also reject me and say, 'Look! This man eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he is friends with tax collectors and other sinners!' But anyone who is truly wise will show it by doing good deeds."

\v 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they said, 'He has a demon.'
\v 19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'See, a gluttonous man and a wine drinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!
But wisdom is justified by her deeds."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * Jesus continues talking to the crowd about John the Baptist.
  * **came neither eating nor drinking **- This could be translated "fasted and did not drink wine" or "did not eat good food and did not drink wine" (UDB); it does not mean that he never had to eat or drink.
  * **they**  - This word refers to the people of that generation (verse 16).
  * **gluttonous man **- a man who eats too much food
  * **wisdom is justified **- This expression, where wisdom is personified, is not used here in the sense that wisdom is put right before God but in the sense that wisdom is proved right. (See: Personification)
  * **her deeds**  - The pronoun "her" refers to the personified wisdom.
