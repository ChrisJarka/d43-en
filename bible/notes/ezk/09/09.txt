\v 9 He replied, "The sins of the people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Israel and Judah are extremely great. People are murdered \f + \ft metonymy \f* everywhere \add in this country\add*, and this city is full of people who act unjustly. They say, 'Yahweh has abandoned this country, and he does not see \add what we are doing\add*.'
\v 10 So I will not pity them or act mercifully toward them. I will do to them the evil things that they have done to other people."

\p
\v 9 He said to me, "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of blood and the city full 
perversions, since they say, 'Yahweh has forgotten the land,' and 'Yahweh does not see!'
\v 10 So then, my eye will not look with compassion and I will not spare their activity. I will instead set it on their heads.
\v 11 For behold! The man dressed in linen who has the writers' tools by his side is returning. He reports and says, 'I have done according to
all you have commanded!.'"
