When it was whole, it could not make anything; surely then, when the fire has consumed it and it is burned then it still won't make anything! \v 6 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: As the vine tree among the trees of the thicket that are given to fuel the fire, so I will give over the inhabitants of Jerusalem! </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues the parable to Ezekiel.

  * **Behold! When it was whole** - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **when it was whole** - "when it was complete".
  * **surely then** - This is a phrase used to confirm a statement.
  * **when the fire has consumed it**  - "Consumed" is another word for "ate" or "devoured". It is complete and total.
  * **it still won't make anything**  - "Won't" is a contraction of the words "will not". "Make" usually means "create".
  * **Therefore, thus says the Lord Yahweh**  - "Therefore" is a word of the previous thoughts to the following thoughts. Or, "therefore" tells one what the following information is "there for".
  * **over the inhabitants of Jerusalem **- "Inhabitants" is another word for people who live in a city, region or country.
