\c 27
\q
\v 1 Boast not yourself of tomorrow;
\q For you know not what a day may bring forth.
\q
\v 2 Let another man praise thee, and not your own mouth;
\q A stranger, and not your own lips.
\q
\v 3 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty;
\q But a fool’s vexation is heavier than they both.
\q
\v 4 Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming;
\q But who is able to stand before jealousy?
\q
\v 5 Better is open rebuke
\q Than love that is hidden.
\q
\v 6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend;
\q But the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
\q
\v 7 The full soul loatheth a honeycomb;
\q But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
\q
\v 8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest,
\q So is a man that wandereth from his place.
\q
\v 9 Oil and perfume rejoice the heart;
\q So does the sweetness of a man’s friend that comes of hearty counsel.
\q
\v 10 Your own friend, and your father’s friend, forsake not;
\q And go not to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity:
\q Better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off.
\q
\v 11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,
\q That I may answer him that reproaches me.
\q
\v 12 A prudent man sees the evil, and hides himself;
\q But the simple pass on, and suffer for it.
\q
\v 13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger;
\q And hold him in pledge that is surety for a foreign woman.
\q
\v 14 He that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning,
\q It shall be counted a curse to him.
\q
\v 15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day
\q And a contentious woman are alike:
\q
\v 16 He that would restrain her restraineth the wind;
\q And his right hand encountereth oil.
\q
\v 17 Iron sharpeneth iron;
\q So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
\q
\v 18 Whoso keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof;
\q And he that regards his master shall be honored.
\q
\v 19 As in water face answereth to face,
\q So the heart of man to man.
\q
\v 20 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied;
\q And the eyes of man are never satisfied.
\q
\v 21 The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold;
\q And a man is tried by his praise.
\q
\v 22 Though you should bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with bruised grain,
\q Yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
\b
\q
\v 23 Be you diligent to know the state of your flocks,
\q And look well to your herds:
\q
\v 24 For riches are not for ever;
\q And does the crown endure to all generations?
\q
\v 25 The hay is carried, and the tender grass showeth itself,
\q And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in.
\q
\v 26 The lambs are for your clothing,
\q And the goats are the price of the field;
\q
\v 27 And there will be goats’ milk enough for your food, for the food of your household,
\q And maintenance for your maidens.
