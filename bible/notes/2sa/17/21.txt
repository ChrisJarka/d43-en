\v 21 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they
said to David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counselled against you.
\v 22 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there
lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.
