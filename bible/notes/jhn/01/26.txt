\v 26 John replied, "I am just baptizing people with water. But now there is someone standing among you, whom you do not know,
\v 27 he will preach to you after I am gone. He is so important that I am not worthy to serve him as a slave or even untie his sandals."

\v 28 These things happened at a place called Bethany over on the east side of the Jordan River. That is where John was baptizing all the people.

\v 26 John replied to  them, saying," I baptize within water. However, in  the midst of you  stands one whom you do not recognize.
\v 27 This is the one who is coming after me.  I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals."
\v 28 These things were done in Bethany on the other side of  the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
