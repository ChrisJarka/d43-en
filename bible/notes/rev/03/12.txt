\v 12 He who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will not come out any more. I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which will come down out of heaven from my God, and my new name.
\v 13 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
