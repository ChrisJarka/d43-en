**What is 1 Chronicles about?**\\
The purpose of the 1 Chronicles was to retell the genealogy of Adam to Jacob (who is known as Israel), and then trace some of the history of Israel leading up to the death of David. 1 Chronicles was likely written to those who returned from exile in Babylon and gave them instructions on how to avoid the mistakes that were made in the kingdom of Judah.

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\ 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "1 Chronicles" is named for the events of the book which focus on the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah. It is likely that the books of 1 and 2 Chronicles were originally one book but were separated because they could not be printed together in one volume. One possible title is "The events of the kings."

**Who wrote 1 Chronicles?**\\
The book of 1 Chronicles likely contains many different historical accounts which were put together. The writers of Chronicles refer to other resources that they used in writing their history but they may have been written or edited by Ezra. The writers of 1 Chronicles refer to other resources that they used in writing their history. These were titles non-biblical sources such as “The Chronicles of Samuel the Seer," "The Chronicles of Nathan the Seer," "The Chronicles of Gad the Seer," "The History of Nathan the Prophet," "The Chronicles of Shemaiah the Prophet and Iddo," "The Story of the Prophet Iddo" and "The books of the kings of Judah and Israel."

**Why are there multiple books which give the history of the kings of Israel?**\\
Though Chronicles covers much of the same history as the books of Kings, they do not repeat everything. The books of Kings have many omissions from the Chronicles, and there are also some additions in one history that is not found in the other. The purpose of Chronicles is not simply to retell the history of Israel and Judah, repeating the books of Kings, but to reaffirm the relationship between Yahweh and his people, even though the nation of Israel (and Judah) had been effectively destroyed, and was being rebuilt. To that end, Chronicles focuses on David and Solomon and the reformation accomplished by Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah. Those reformations were to serve encouragements for all the people of Israel and their leaders to obey the Law and to honor Yahweh’s covenant with them, as they work on the rebuilding of the nation and the Temple.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
**What is the kingdom of the [[:en:obe:kt:christ|messiah]]?**\\

From this point forward in the history of Israel, a major part of Israel's religion is the hope of the coming messiah to establish his kingdom. The messiah would be the one who ultimately deliver Israel.

**What is retribution?**\\

Retribution is important in 1 Chronicles. Part of this is a record of the fulfillment of the promise to bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel. It is different from vengeance. Retribution is a just judgment. What the author attempts to show the reader is God's blessing or judgment being given to each generation in accordance with their obedience to the commands of Yahweh.

**Why are alliances with foreign countries seen as [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]]?**\\
Because Yahweh was their leader and the one who protected Israel, an alliance to defend their nation showed a lack of faith.  

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====


**What is the meaning of the term Israel?**\\
Israel is used in many different ways in Scripture. The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel.  This people group is also the [[:en:obe:other:israel|nation of Israel]]. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, which is a reference to the "[[:en:obe:other:kingdomofisrael|kingdom of Israel]]." 1 Kings references both the northern kingdom of Israel and the whole nation of Israel as "Israel".

**Why does the author frequently repeat words or phrases?**\\
The writer often does this for emphasis or to ensure his reader understand. He often does this to explain to his reader that true worship is not about external obedience to the Law of Moses but it involves the inner attitude of the heart and genuine repentance.

**What does it mean to "seek God?"**\\
The concept of seeking God is very common in Chronicles. It does not imply that God is hidden, rather it is a command to seek to please or to honor God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
