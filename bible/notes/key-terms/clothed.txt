====== clothed ======

===== Definition: =====

When used figuratively in the Bible this term means the same as endowed or equipped.

  * To be "clothed with power from on high" means to have power given to you.
  * In the same way that clothing is external to your body and is visible to all, when you are "clothed" with something it becomes the quality that others can readily recognize in a person, such as "clothed in righteousness."
