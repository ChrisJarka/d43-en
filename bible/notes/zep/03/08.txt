===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Therefore wait for me—this is Yahweh's declaration—until the day that I rise up to seize the prey.
\q For my decision is to assemble the nations, to gather the kingdoms,
\q to pour out on them my anger—all of my burning wrath;
\q for in the fire of my jealousy all the earth will be consumed. 
\f + \ft The Hebrew text as \fqa until the day that I rise up for the victim \fqa* . However, some ancient and modern versions have \fqa until the day that I rise up as a witness \fqa* . \f*
