===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **if...if...if...if...then...**
 - This is a parallel construction, a poetic device to expand comparable ideas that the then-clause unifies. It is nearly the same as saying, "Because (A is true and B is true and C is true), therefore complete my joy by thinking and doing as I do."
