====== Introduction to Titus ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of Titus ===

  - Paul instructs Titus to appoint Godly leaders (1:1-16)
  - Then, he also instructs him to train people to live Godly lives (2:1-3:11)
  - Finally, Paul ends by sharing some of his plans and sending greetings (3:12-15)

=== What is the Book of Titus about? ===

Paul instructed Titus who was leading the churches on the island of Crete. Paul gave specific instructions to Titus on the selecting and training of church leaders. He gave similar instructions in his letters to Timothy.  His letter describes how church leaders should be held to a high standard.  Churches and church leaders today should pay careful attention to the standards required of those in leadership.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Titus." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's Letter to Titus," or "A Letter to Titus." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Titus? ===

Paul from the city of Tarsus was the author. Paul was writing to Titus, but he also wrote this letter so could be read aloud publicly. He had been known as Saul in his early life, when as a Pharisee he was a determined persecutor of Christians. After he began to trust in Jesus Christ, he made a number of missionary journeys in order to preach the gospel among both Jews and non-Jews living outside the land of Israel.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is discipleship? ===

The term [[:en:obe:kt:disciple|disciple]] refers to a person who spends time with a teacher, learning from that teacher's character and teaching. Discipleship is the process of making disciples (sometimes called mentoring outside of Scripture). This letter gives many instructions about how a leader disciples a less mature Christian. The goal of discipleship is to encourage other Christians to grown in likeness to Christ. It is common for Paul to those he disciples as spiritual "brothers" or "sons."

=== In what roles can people serve within the church? ===

There is some controversial teachings in the book of Titus concerning whether a woman or divorced man can serve in positions of leadership within the church. It is important to avoid inputing one's theological perspective into the translation. Further research on these issues prior to translation may be necessary.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the meaning of "God our Savior?" ===

This is a common phrase in this letter. It emphasizes the fact that God has saved Christians from the punishment for their sin.

=== Should the terms elder, bishop and overseer be translated the same way? ===

What do you think about this question? I think it may be too difficult theologically.
