\v 13 But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbears to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he offered not the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
\v 14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover to Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: you shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him that is born in the land.
