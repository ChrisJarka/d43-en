<usfm>
\v 44 But while those kings are ruling, God who rules in heaven will establish a kingdom that will never end. No one will ever defeat its king. He will completely destroy all those kingdoms, but his kingdom will remain forever.
\v 45 That is the meaning of the rock that something cut from the mountain, the rock that will crush to tiny bits the statue that is made of iron, bronze, silver, and gold."

\v 44 And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the
sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand
for ever.
\v 45 Forasmuch as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain wiyout hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron,
the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and
the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
