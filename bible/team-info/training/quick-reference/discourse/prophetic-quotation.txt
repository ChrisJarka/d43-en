====== Prophetic Quotation ======

===== Description =====

Prophets often quoted what God said. Sometimes it is clear when a prophet was quoting God because the text says "The Lord says." But often there is no clear indication when God's speech ends. Also prophets often quoted God without marking it at all. There were no quotation marks in the original Hebrew text, and so English translations often put the quote marks in different places. Translators may follow the interpretations in the ULB, or UDB, or the interpretations of other translations that they have.


===== Notes for Beginning of Each Chapter =====

(version 1) Prophets wrote God's messages to people. Sometimes they directly quoted God and sometimes they reported the information that God gave them. Sometimes it is not clear whether or not the prophet was directly quoting God.

(version 2) Prophets spoke for God, and God spoke through the prophets. This is why the words of the prophets are also the very words of God. As a result, it can be very difficult to decide who is the primary speaker for a particular verse. In some verses, the ULD and ULB add quotation marks to help identify the speaker. In other verses, it is not possible to decide, and therefore quotation marks are not used. You should follow the pattern of your language for identifying speakers and quotation when possible. But also realize that this will not be possible for every verse.


===== Notes for Individual Verses =====

These are sample notes to indicate the speaker for a specific verse.

=== Ref ch:vv ===

"Ah, nation, sinners, a people weighed down with iniquity..."
"A sinful nation, a people weighted down by their sin..."

The words in 1:4-10 were probably spoken by Isaiah.

=== Ref ch:vv ===

"ULB text of the verse for which the note is created."
