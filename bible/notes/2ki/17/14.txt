===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 But the Israelite people would not pay attention. They were stubborn [IDI] just like their ancestors were. Just like their ancestors did, they refused to believe in Yahweh their God.
\v 15 They rejected Yahweh's laws and the agreement that he had made with their ancestors. They ignored Yahweh's warnings. They worshiped worthless idols and as a result they themselves became worthless. Although Yahweh had commanded them not to imitate the behavior of the people-groups that lived near them, they disobeyed that command.

\v 14 Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like to the neck of their fathers, who believed not in
Jehovah their God.
\v 15 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified
to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the nations that were round about them,
concerning whom Jehovah had charged them that they should not do like them.
