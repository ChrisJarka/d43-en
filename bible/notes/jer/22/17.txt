\q2 They will not say to each other, 'It is very sad; we are so sorry!'
\q1 The people whom he ruled will not mourn for him, saying,
\q2 'We are sad that our king is dead; we are so sorry that the wonderful things \add that happened while he was king are ended\add*.'

<usfm>
\v 17 But your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and
for violence, to do it.
\v 18 Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: they shall not lament for him,
saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! They shall not lament for him,
saying Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!
\v 19 He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
