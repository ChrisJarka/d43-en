\v 1 Then Job answered and said,
\q
\v 2 How have you helped him that is without power!
\q How have you saved the arm that has no strength!
\q
\v 3 How have you counselled him that has no wisdom,
\q And plentifully declared sound knowledge!
\q
\v 4 To whom have you uttered words?
\q And whose spirit came forth from thee?
