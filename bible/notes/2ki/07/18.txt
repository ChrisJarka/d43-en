\v 18 And it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, "Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, will be available tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria,"
\v 19 and that captain answered the man of God, and said, "Now, behold, if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be?" and Elisha said, "Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but will not eat thereof,"
\v 20 came to pass even so to him, for the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.
