===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he lay facedown** - This indicates that Moses was humbling himself before God. He was afraid that God would punish the people for rebelling against God and his chosen leaders. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **who is dedicated to Yahweh** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "whom Yahweh has dedicated to himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **bring him up to himself** - Here "him" refers to the man whom Yahweh chooses and "himself" refers to Yahweh.
