\v 20 The tree that you sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to heaven, and the sight thereof to all the
earth;
\v 21 whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field
dwelt, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation:
\v 22 it is thou, O king, that are grown and become strong; for your greatness is grown, and reaches to heaven, and your
dominion to the end of the earth.
