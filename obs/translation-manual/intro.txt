===== Introduction to unfoldingWord =====

Welcome to unfoldingWord! unfoldingWord is a project put together and managed by various missions organizations and volunteers from around the world who think that everyone should have adequate Biblical content, in their own language, without copyright restrictions, and for free.

unfoldingWord uses tools like Door43 and translationStudio as platforms where the global church can collaborate to translate open Biblical content. We have also created a three-tier checking system which empowers the global church not only to translate the content, but to corroborate its accuracy. unfoldingWord is also a digital publishing engine that will push checked content through the engine to make it available online, on the mobile app, for download, and in print-ready formats. By empowering the global church in this way, we believe this process will help provide unrestricted Biblical content, in every language, for every people group.

The purpose of this document is to introduce the reader to the unfoldingWord project and teach the process of translating, checking, and publishing through unfoldingWord.
