====== Punctuation ======


We have decided to use "American-style" punctuation. For this project, that means:


    * Final punctuation should be included inside the quotation marks. (Ex. He said, "What are you doing?")
    * Do not use a comma before the "and" in a string of items. (Ex. the length, height and depth of the box.)
    * Use a colon between the chapter and verse on a Bible reference (Luke 1:2-5)
    * Add double-quotation marks for direct speech, and single-quotation marks for quotations within quotations.
    * When referring to a term in a note, add double-quotes around the term to set it off from the other text (The meaning of "grace" is...).
    * When writing a string of translation alternatives separated by "or," do not use commas between the phrases. (That is, "one time" or "the next" or "all at once.")
