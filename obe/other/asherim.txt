====== Asherah, Asherim ======

===== Definition: =====

Asherah was the name of a goddess that was worshiped by Canaanite people groups during Old Testament times.

  * This term and the plural form "Asherim" refer to carved wooden images or carved trees that were made to represent this goddess. Sometimes these images are referred to as "Asherah poles."
  * The Asherim were often set up near altars for the false god Baal, who was thought of as Asherah's husband.
  * God commanded the Israelites to destroy all the carved images of Asherah.
  * Some leaders like Gideon, King Asa, and King Josiah obeyed God and led the people in destroying these idols.
  * But other Israelite leaders such as Solomon, influenced the people of Israel to worship the Asherim and other idols.
