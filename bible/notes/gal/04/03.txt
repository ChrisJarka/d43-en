\v 3 So also we, when we were children, we were held in bondage under the sinful belief systems of the world,
\v 4 but when humanity fulfilled God's timing, God sent out his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
\v 5 that he might redeem those who were under the law, that he might adopt us as his children.
