====== clothe, clothed ======

===== Definition: =====

When used figuratively in the Bible, "clothed with" means to be endowed or equipped with something. To "clothe" oneself with something means to outwardly show a certain characteristic.

  * To be "clothed with power from on high" means to have power given to you.
  * In the same way that clothing is external to your body and is visible to all, when you are "clothed" with something it becomes a quality that others can readily recognize, such as "clothed in righteousness" or "clothe yourself with joy".
  * It can also be used to express negative states of being such as "clothed with shame".
  * If it is not possible keep the same figure of speech, this could be translated as, "showing" or "manifesting" or "be filled with".
