====== TQ Workshop ======

The Translation Question (TQ) workshop will be held in Orlando on Jan. 4-7 in conference room #3 of the WA building.

The purpose of the workshop is to write TQ's for as many books of the Bible as possible in the time allotted. TQ's for about half of the chapters of the Bible have already been completed. The workshop will help by doing other books, beginning with Psalms.
