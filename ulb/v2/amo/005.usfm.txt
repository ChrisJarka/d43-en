\c 5
\p
\v 1 Hear you this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.
\v 2 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up.
\v 3 For thus says the Lord Jehovah: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth
a hundred shall have ten left, to the house of Israel.
\p
\v 4 For thus says Jehovah to the house of Israel, Seek you me, and you shall live;
\v 5 but seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and
Beth-el shall come to nought.
\v 6 Seek Jehovah, and you shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to
quench it in Beth-el.
\v 7 You who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,
\v 8 seek him that makes the Pleiades and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the
day dark with night; that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the face of the earth (Jehovah is his
name);
\v 9 that brings sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction comes upon the fortress.
\p
\v 10 They hate him that reproves in the gate, and they abhor him that speaks uprightly.
\v 11 Forasmuch therefore as you trample upon the poor, and take exactions from him of wheat: you have built houses of hewn
stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink the wine thereof.
\v 12 For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sinsâ€”ye that afflict the just, that take a
bribe, and that turn aside the needy in the gate from their
right.
\v 13 Therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time.
\p
\v 14 Seek good, and not evil, that you may live; and so Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be with you, as you say.
\v 15 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be
gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
\p
\v 16 Therefore thus says Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways; and they shall say in
all the streets, Alas! Alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skillful in lamentation to wailing.
\v 17 And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, says Jehovah.
\p
\v 18 Woe to you that desire the day of Jehovah! Wherefore would you have the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light.
\v 19 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a
serpent bit him.
\v 20 Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
\p
\v 21 I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.
\v 22 Yea, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the
peace-offerings of your fat beasts.
\v 23 Take you away from me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your viols.
\v 24 But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
\p
\v 25 Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty youars, O house of Israel?
\v 26 Yea, you have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which you made to
yourselves.
\v 27 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, says Jehovah, whose name is the God of hosts.
