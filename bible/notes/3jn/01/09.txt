\v 9 I wrote \add a letter\add* to the congregation \add telling them to help those fellow believers\add*. However, Diotrephes does not acknowledge my authority\f + \ft Or: \add pay any attention to what\add* I wrote \f*, because he desires to be in charge\f + \ft Or: wants to be the leader \f* of \add the congregation\add*.
\v 10 So, when I arrive \add there\add* I will \add publicly\add* tell what he does: He tells others evil nonsense about us \add in order to\add* harm \add us by what he\add* says, and he is not content with only doing that. He himself refuses to receive the fellow believers who are traveling around doing God's work, and he also stops those who want to receive them by expelling them from the congregation.

\v 9 I wrote somewhat to the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
\v 10 Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbids and throws them out of the church.
