\c 2
\p
\v 1 And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.
\v 2 Then said I, Whither go thou? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what
is the length thereof.
\v 3 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
\v 4 and said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason
of the multitude of men and cattle therein.
\v 5 For I, says Jehovah, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
\p
\v 6 Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, says Jehovah; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens,
says Jehovah.
\v 7 Ho Zion, escape, you that live with the daughter of Babylon.
\v 8 For thus says Jehovah of hosts: After glory has he sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he that touches
you touches the apple of his eye.
\v 9 For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them; and you shall know that
Jehovah of hosts has sent me.
\v 10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, says Jehovah.
\v 11 And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of
thee, and you shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me to thee.
\v 12 And Jehovah shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
\v 13 Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.
