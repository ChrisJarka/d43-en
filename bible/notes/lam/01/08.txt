<usfm>
\v 8 We, the people of Jerusalem, have sinned very much;
\q2 our city has become like a bloody rag between a woman's legs.
\q1 Everyone who previously honored our city now despise it;
\q2 they are like people who strip a woman bare and then mock her.
\q1 Now we groan in the city;
\q2 we are like a woman without clothes who tries to cover herself with her hands.
\q1
\v 9 It is as if our city has become filthy because we have sinned so greatly;
\q2 we did not think about how God would punish us.
\q1 We did not imagine how we would suffer;
\q2 there is no one to comfort us.
\q1 We all call out to God, "Yahweh, look at how we are suffering
\q2 because our enemies have defeated us!"


\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Jerusalem sinned greatly, therefore, she has become scorned as something that is filthy.
\q All who honored her now despise her since they have seen her nakedness.
\q She groans and tries to turn away.
\q
\v 9 She has become unclean beneath her skirts. She did not think about her future.
\q Her fall was terrible. There was no one to comfort her.
\q She cried out, "Look at my affliction, Yahweh, for the enemy has become too great!"

  * **has become scorned** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "has become an object of scorn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
