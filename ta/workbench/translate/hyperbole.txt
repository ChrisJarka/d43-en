[[Summary of 100 words or less]]

Hyperbole describes something as larger or greater than it really is to show how strongly the speaker feels about it. Hyperbole is a deliberate, often extreme or even unreal exaggeration used to emphasize a speaker’s feeling or opinion. 

===== Description =====

Hyperbole is a figure of speech in which the speaker seeks to illustrate the importance of something by providing a greatly exaggerated or unreal statement to describe it. (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]). 

**Reason this is a translation issue** \\ 
If readers understand a statement of hyperbole as if it is literally true, then they will misunderstand the real meaning. If the statement of hyperbole is literally true then it cannot be trusted and it must be totally false, or wrong, or a lie, or nonsense. If the reader does not understand the real figurative meaning of a statement of hyperbole that is intended by the speaker, then the reader may become very confused and believe the meaning is nonsense.\\ 

Some sentences may use the words "all" or "everyone" and be simply a general way of speaking about something without expressing any special emotion.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**When the sun was setting, people brought to Jesus __everyone who was sick__ with various kinds of diseases. He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them. **  Luke 4:40 \\ Luke wrote that "everyone" brought their sick ones to Jesus. This is hyperbole. Probably not everyone did this, but __many__ did. Hyperbole helps to show how excited people were that Jesus could heal them and that __a large number__ of them came to him to be healed.\\ 
\\ 
**When they had brought their boats to land, __they left everything__ and followed him.**  Luke 5:11 \\ Luke wrote that when Jesus invited some fishermen to follow him, they left __everything__. We know that they left their fishing business. Saying that they left "everything" may be a case of hyperbole to emphasize that now they had completely given everything in their lives over to the control of the Lord Jesus.\\
\\
**If your hand causes you to stumble, __cut it off__. It is better for you to enter into life maimed...** Mark 9:43a\\
When Jesus said to __cut off__ your hand, he meant that we should __do whatever extreme things we need to do in order not to sin__. He used this hyperbole to show how extremely important it is to try to stop sinning. Sin weakens our lives from following Jesus, so we must seriously seek to turn from sinning.\\
\\
**If anyone comes to me and does not __hate__ his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters--yes, and his own life also--he cannot be my disciple.** Luke 14:26
Because of many other things that Jesus said, we know that his use of the word “hate” here is hyperbole. He meant that __we must not love even our own family members more than we love him__. Because the Lord Jesus is our God and Savior, we must put him first. Our love for Jesus is the most important love in our lives.
===== Translation Strategies =====

  - Keep the statement of hyperbole if it would not be misunderstood or thought to be a lie.
  - Express the meaning without the hyperbole. For example "all the people" could be translated as "large crowds of people."
  - If you decide to express the meaning without the hyperbole, be sure that it truly is hyperbole. God does miraculous things. Do not assume that something could not have happened just because it seems to be impossible.


===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Keep the statement of hyperbole if it would not be misunderstood or thought to be a lie.
