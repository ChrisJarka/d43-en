<usfm>
\v 19 Our confidently expecting to receive what God has promised is like an anchor that very securely and reliably holds us fast. The one we confidently expect to hold us is Jesus, who goes into God's very presence, just like the high priests went behind the curtain into the innermost part of the tent where God was present.
\v 20 Jesus went into God's presence ahead of us to allow us to enter with God, too,  because of Jesus' forgiveness, which he accomplished when he became a high priest eternally in the way that Melchizedek was a high priest.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 We have this hope as a secure and reliable anchor of the soul which enters into the holy place behind the curtain;
\v 20 where Jesus entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
