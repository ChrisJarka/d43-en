\v 13 So I will tell you what is really happening. Our ancestors, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, worshiped God. And now God has greatly honored Jesus. Your leaders brought Jesus to the governor, Pilate, so that his soldiers would execute him. You were the ones who rejected Jesus as your Messiah in the presence of Pilate, after Pilate had decided that he should release Jesus.
\v 14 Although Jesus always did what was right, you asked for a killer to be set free instead of him!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. He is the one whom you delivered up and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had decided to release him.
\v 14 You rejected the Holy and Righteous One, and you asked instead for a murderer to be released to you.
