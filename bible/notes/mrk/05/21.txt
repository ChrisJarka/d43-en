\v 21 And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he
was by the sea.
\v 22 And there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he falls at his feet,
\v 23 and implores him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death:
I pray thee, that you come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live.
\v 24 And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.
