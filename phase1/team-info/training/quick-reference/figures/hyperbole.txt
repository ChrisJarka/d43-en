====== Hyperbole ======

===== Description =====

A hyperbole is an **exaggeration** that is used to show the speaker's feeling or opinion about something. It is not meant to deceive, but to make an impression.

The tA page for hyperbole is also used for **generalizations**. This is when a speaker uses words like "every" or "all" to mean something like "very many," but not "every single one."

===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.

=== Matthew 23:24 ===

You blind guides, you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!

  * **(1) but swallow a camel**  - **(3)**  This is a an exaggeration. A camel cannot fall into a person's drink, and a person cannot swallow a camel. Its purpose is to show that the religious leaders were doing something extremely foolish. **(4)**  AT: "but swallow something very large that has fallen into the drink" **(5)**  (See: Hyperbole)
=== Luke 14:26 ===

If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters–yes, and his own life also–he cannot be my disciple.

  * **(1) does not hate his own father**  - **(3)**  This is an exaggeration to show how important it is to love Jesus much more than anyone else. **(4)**  If it would be misunderstood, it can be translated as "does not love me much more than he loves his own father" **(5)**  (See: Hyperbole).
=== Judges 20:16 ===

Among all these people there were seven hundred chosen left-handed men; each of them could sling stones at something no wider than a hair and not miss.

  * **(1) could sling stones at something no wider than a hair and not miss**  - **(3)**  This exaggeration is used to show how amazingly accurately these men could aim and throw a stone a something. **(4)**  AT: "could sling stones at very small targets and not miss" **(5)**  (See: Hyperbole)

===Psalms 58:10 ===
The righteous will rejoice when he sees God's vengeance;
he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked,

  * **(1) he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked** - **(3)** The great number of wicked people who die is expressed by using the exaggeration of righteous people washing their feet in the wicked people's blood. **(4)** AT: "So many wicked people will die that when the righteous march on their blood, it will seem as if they could wash their feet in it" **(5)** (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])

(This example is complicated because it also has washing the feet as a metaphor for getting the feet wet when trampling on the blood. There is also a note for that.)
