====== Ezekiel 46:16-18 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare: If the king gives some of his land to one of his sons, to belong to him permanently, it will then eventually permanently belong to his son's descendants.
\v 17 However, if he gives some of his land to one of his servants, the servant is allowed to keep that land until the Year of Celebration. Then the king will own it again. But if the king gives land to his sons, that land will belong to them permanently.
\v 18 The king must not take any land that the people own and force them to live somewhere else. The land that he gives to his sons must be from his own property, \add not from anyone else's property\add*, in order that none of my people will be separated from his own property.'~"

\v 16 Thus says the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to
his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.
\v 17 But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall
return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons.
\v 18 Moreover the prince shall not take of the peopleâ€™s inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give
inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.
