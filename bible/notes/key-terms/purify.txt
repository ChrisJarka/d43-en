To purify something is to make it pure and free from anything that contaminates or pollutes it. In the Bible, "purification" is mainly cleansing from things that make an object or a person ritually unclean and unfit to be in  God's presence.  To purify a person is to make them ceremonial clean from things such as illness, contact with a dead body, contact with body fluids, or childbirth. In a spiritual sense to purify a person is to cleanse a person from their sin.

    * In the Old Testament, certain rituals were performed with water and ashes to ceremonially purify a priest for duty.
    * People who trust in Jesus are purified from their sin by Jesus' sacrifice.
