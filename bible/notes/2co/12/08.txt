\v 8 Three times I prayed to the Lord about it, begging him to take this away from me.
\v 9 But he said to me, "\add No, I will not take this away from you. Instead\add*, I will kindly help you, and that will be all that you need, because it is \add when you are\add* weak that I \add can\add* best \add work\add* powerfully \add to help you\add*." So, because of \add what the Lord said to me\add*, I will very gladly boast about \add the things that make\add* me \add seem\add* weak, so that \add people may realize\add* that it is Christ who gives me power \add to serve him\add*.
\v 10 For that reason, \add whenever I am\add* weak, or \add when people\add* insult me, \add or when I have to endure\add* hardships, or \add when I am persecuted\add* \f + \ft Or:\add people\add* cause me to suffer \f* or \add when I am in situations that\add* distress me, I am content because \add I am serving\add* Christ. \add I can say that\add* because at any time when I myself am weak, that is the \add very\add* time when \add Christ\add* powerfully \add helps me\add*.

\v 10 For that reason, whenever I am weak, or when people insult me, or when I have to endure hardships, or when I am persecuted  or when I am in situations that distress me, I am content because I am serving Christ. I can say that because at any time when I myself am weak, that is the very time when Christ powerfully helps me.

\v 8 Concerning this thing I implored the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
\v 9 And he has said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
\v 10 Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christâ€™s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
