====== 1 Corinthians 15:10-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 But it is because God acted kindly toward me in ways that I did not deserve that I became what I am now. And his acting kindly toward me produced a great result \f + \ft litotes \f*, which is that I worked harder \add for Christ\add* than all the other apostles. But it was not that I \add was working with my own ability\add*. Instead, God was helping me in a way I did not deserve.
\v 11 So it does not matter whether it was I \add who was preaching or whether it was the other apostles who were preaching\add*. We all preached \add the same message\add*, and that message is what you believed.

\v 10 By the grace of God I am today what I am, and his grace has accomplished many wonderful things in those who believe. His grace was never in vain in me. Because of my position as the least of the apostles, I worked harder than all the others. But it was not me who worked, it was the grace of God that empowered me.
\v 11 So whether it is the other apostles or me who preached, we proclaimed the gospel of Christ, and you believed the message.

\v 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace that was given to me was not in vain. But I worked harder than all of them.  Yet it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.
\v 11 Therefore whether it is I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
