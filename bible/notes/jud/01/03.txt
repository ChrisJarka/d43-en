====== Jude 01:3-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 You whom I love, I was very eager\f + \ft Or: very much wanted \f* to write to you about that which we all share\f + \ft Or: have in common \f*, which is how \add God\f + \ft Or: Jesus Christ\add* \f* \add has\add* saved \add us\add*. But now I realize that it is necessary \add for me\add* to write to you in order to exhort you to defend the \add truth about Christ\add* that we believe. \add Jesus and his apostles\add* gave that truth once for all to us who belong to God, \add and we must not let it be changed\add* \f + \ft Or:\add anyone revise, Or: change it\add* \f*.
\v 4 Some people falsely \add teach that because\add* God kindly does for us what we do not deserve, it does not matter\f + \ft Or: is all right \f* if we continue to sin. \add Those people show by the way that they conduct their lives\add* that they do not want to admit\f + \ft Or: accept \f* that Jesus Christ \add is\add* our only Master and Lord. \add It was written\add* long ago \f + \ft Or:\add Someone\add* long ago wrote \f* that \add God\add* would condemn such ungodly people\f + \ft Or: people like that whose lives are displeasing to him \f*. But some \add of those\add* people have entered \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like crawling snakes\add* into your congregations \add and oppose the truth about Christ, so you must resist, Or: oppose them\add*.

\v 3 You whom I love, I tried very hard to write a letter to you about how God has saved us all together. I needed to write to encourage you to do your best to speak for the true things that we believe. These are things that God has taught to all those who trust in Christ. These things will never change.
\v 4 There are men who are creeping into your assemblies; they were like the wicked men the prophets wrote about long ago—they teach false things and they twist the grace of God into giving permission to commit sexual sin. In this way they oppose what is true about Jesus Christ, our only Master and Lord.

\v 3 Beloved, while I was making every effort to write to you about our common salvation, I had to write to you to exhort you to struggle earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the believers.
\v 4 For certain men have slipped in secretly among you—men who were marked out for condemnation—ungodly men who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality, and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jude tells the believers his reason for writing this letter.
  * **General Information:** - The word "our" in this letter includes both Jude and believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])


  * **our common salvation** - "the salvation we share"
  * **I had to write** - "I felt a great need to write" or "I felt an urgent need to write"
  * **to exhort you to struggle earnestly for the faith** - "to encourage you to defend the true teaching"
  * **believers** - "saints." Some versions translate here "holy ones." It gives the essential idea of Christian believers with no special emphasis on their moral qualities, but rather believers who are made saints by belief in Jesus' death for salvation.
  * **For certain men have slipped in secretly** - "For some men have come in among the believers without drawing attention to themselves" 
  * **men who were marked out for condemnation—ungodly** - "stealthily—the scriptures written long ago say that these men will be condemned men—ungodly"
  * **who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality** - "who change the grace of our God into filthy lust" or "who teach that God's grace permits one to continue to live in sexual sin"
  * **deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ** - Possible meanings are 1) these men do not obey Jesus Christ (as explained in [[:en:bible:notes:jud:01:07|1:8]]) or 2) they teach that he is not the true or only way to God.
