===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Every place where the sole of your foot will tread will be yours - ** Here the sole of a foot is used to refer to the entire nation of Israel. AT: " Every place where you set your foot will be yours." (See: Synecdoche)
  * **No man will be able to stand before you - ** This figure of speech using the word “stand” represents holding ground in a battle. "You" throughout this verse refers to the entire nation of Israel. AT: “No one will be able to stand against you” (See: Metonymy and Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural)
  * **Yahweh your God will lay the fear of you and the terror of you upon all the land - ** AT: "Yahweh your God will instill terror and fear of you throughtout the entire land." The word "land" represents all the enemies who lived in that territory. The enemies would be afraid, not the physical land. (See: Metonymy)
  * **that you thread on**  - "that you set foot on." Look at the above translation note for the use of the word foot refering again to the entire nation of Israel.
