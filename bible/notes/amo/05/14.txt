\v 14 In order to remain alive,

\q2 like you claim \add that he always is\add*.
\q1
\v 15 Love what is good, and hate what is evil!
\q2 Try to cause \add judges\add* in your courts to make decisions that are right\f + \ft Or: fair \f*!
\q1 If you do those things, perhaps the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels,

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Seek good and not evil** - Here "Seek good" represents choosing to do what good. "Good" and "evil" represent good actions and evil actions. AT: "Choose to do what is good and not what is evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Hate evil, love good** - "Hate evil actions, and love good actions." Here "good" and "evil" represent good actions and evil actions.
  * **establish justice in the city gate** - Here "establish justice" represents making sure that justice is done. AT: "make sure that justice is done in the city gates" or "make sure that the judges make just decisions in the city gates" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **in the city gate** - City gates were where business transactions occurred and judgments were made, because city walls were thick enough to have gateways that produced cool shade from the hot sun AT: "in your courts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the remnant of Joseph** - Here "remnant" refers to people who are still living in Israel after the others are killed or taken away as captives. Here "Joseph" represents the northern kingdom of Israel, whose two largest tribes were the descendants of Joseph. See how you translated "house of Joseph" in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:05:06|5:6]]. AT: "the descendants of Joseph who are still alive" or "those of Israel who survive" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
