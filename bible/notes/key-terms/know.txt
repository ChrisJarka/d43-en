====== knew, have relations with, lay with, sleep with ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, these terms are euphemisms that refer to having sexual intercourse. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:euphemism|Euphemism]])

  * In Genesis it says that Adam "knew" Eve and she conceived children.
  * Some English versions also use the expression "made love to" or "was intimate with" to refer to having sexual relations with one's wife. For other references to sexual relations, these versions use an expression such as "sleep with" or "lay with."
  * Certain expressions may imply wrong sexual relations, such as between a married man and someone who is not his wife. For example to "sleep with" someone can have this meaning in English.
  * A translation may use different expressions in different contexts, depending on whether it is talking about a husband and wife or whether it is talking about some other relationship. Make sure that the translation of this term has the correct meaning for each context.
