===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.”** Luke 1:18 (WEB)\\ 
When Zechariah asked the angel how he could be sure that what the angel said was true, he was asking a rhetorical question. What he meant was that he could not believe that what the angel said was true.

**All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of the Lord was with him.** Luke 1:66 (WEB)\\ 
When the people were asking what the child would grow up to be, they were not expecting anyone to answer their question. They were simply expressing that they wondered about it because they were impressed by the surprising things they had heard about his birth.

**He said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”** Luke 2:49 (WEB)\\ 
When Jesus asked his parents why they were looking for them, he did not expect them to tell him why. He was expressing his surprise that they did not know where to find him. He may have also been mildly rebuking them for not knowing where to find him.

**He said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”** Luke 2:49 (WEB)\\ 
When Jesus asked his parents if they didn't know that he needed to be in his Father's house, he was mildly rebuking them and saying that they should have know that he needed to be there.

**He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?** Luke 3:7 (WEB)\\ 
When John asked the crowds who had warned them to flee from God's punishment, he was not expecting them to say someone's name. He was rebuking them harshly for going to him to him to be baptized in order to escape God's punishment when they had no desire to stop sinning.

**For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Isn’t it even you, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?** 1 Thes 2:19 (WEB)\\ 
Paul asked who were the ones he and his friends were proud, joyful, and confident about. He used this rhetorical question to help the Thessalonians focus on the fact that they were the ones. Then to emphasize that even more, he answered his rhetorical question with another rhetorical question, "Isn't it you?"
