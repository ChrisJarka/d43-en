\v 10 \add God is\add* ready \add to punish you if you do not turn away from your sinful behavior, just like\add* a man who lays his axe at the roots of a \add fruit\add* tree \add in order to\add* chop it down and throw it into the fire if it does not produce good fruit \f + \ft metaphor \f*."


\p
\v 11 "As for me, I \add am not very important, because\add* I baptize you \add only\add* with water. I \add baptize you\add* because of your feeling sorry that you have sinned. But someone else will come soon who is very great; \add he will do powerful deeds\add* (OR\add , act powerfully\add*)\add . Because he is\add* superior to me, I am not worthy \add even to do a menial task for him, such as\add* to carry his sandals.
\p He will put \add his\add* Holy Spirit \add within\add* you \add to truly change\add* the way you live \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and \add he will judge others of you and punish you in\add* the fire \add in hell\add*.
\v 12 \add He is like a farmer who wants to clear away the grain that is on the ground where it has been threshed\add* \f + \ft Or:\add they have threshed it\add* \f*\add . That farmer uses a\add* huge fork to throw the grain into the air \add to separate the wheat from the chaff\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and then he cleans up the threshing area. \add Similarly\add*, God will \add separate righteous people from the evil people like a farmer who\add* gathers the wheat into his storage area, and then \add God\add* will burn the\add people who are like\add* chaff with a fire that will never be put out \f + \ft metaphor \f*."

\v 10 God is ready to punish you if you do not turn away from your sinful behavior, just like a man who lays his axe at the roots of a fruit tree in order to chop it down and throw it into the fire if it does not produce good fruit."


\p
\v 11 "As for me, I am not very important, because I baptize you only with water. I baptize you because of your feeling sorry that you have sinned. But someone else will come soon who is very great; he will do powerful deeds. Because he is superior to me, I am not worthy even to do a menial task for him, such as to carry his sandals.
\p He will put his Holy Spirit within you to truly change the way you live, and he will judge others of you and punish you in the fire in hell.
\v 12 He is like a farmer who wants to clear away the grain that is on the ground where it has been threshed." That farmer uses a huge fork to throw the grain into the air to separate the wheat from the chaff, and then he cleans up the threshing area. Similarly, God will separate righteous people from the evil people like a farmer who gathers the wheat into his storage area, and then God will burn thepeople who are like chaff with a
fire that will never be put out.‚Äù

<usfm>
\v 10 Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
\v 11 I baptize you in water for repentance. But he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not
worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
\v 12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor. He will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire."
