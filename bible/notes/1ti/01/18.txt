===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 Timothy, you \add are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a son \add to me\add*. So, based on\f + \ft Or: in accordance with \f* what \add someone\add* previously prophesied\f + \ft Or: told what God revealed to them \f* about you, I am instructing you \add to strongly oppose those who teach false doctrines, Or: teachings. You should oppose them like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a soldier fights strongly against\f + \ft Or: opposes \f* \add those who attack his countrymen\add*.
\v 19 Continue to believe \add the true teaching\add* and do only what you know to be right! Remember that some people have pushed aside\f + \ft Or: rejected \f* the true teaching. As a result, they no longer believe \f + \ft metaphor \f* what is true.
\v 20 Among the ones who have done that are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I put in the hands of Satan, in order that \add when Satan punishes them\add* they may learn not to teach wrong teaching.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 This command I set before you, Timothy, my child. Let the prophecies that were spoken about you lead you in your warfare.
\v 19 Trust God and keep a good conscience.  Some people disregard their own consciences and as a result are shipwrecked concerning their faith.
\v 20 Hymenaeus and Alexander have done this so I gave them over to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme.

\p
\v 18 I set this command before you, Timothy, my child, and I agree with the prophecies that went forth about you, so that you might fight a good warfare;
\v 19 so that you may have faith and a good conscience. Some people have rejected these and have been shipwrecked in respect to the faith.
\v 20 Such are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I gave over to Satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.
