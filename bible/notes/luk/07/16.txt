===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **fear overcame all of them**  - More literally, this means "fear took everyone." This could also be translated as "They were all filled with fear."
    * **looked upon ** - Or, "cared for."
    * **His people** - The word here for "people" means "a group of people gathered together in one place." In context, it is referring to the Jewish people as the specific group of people that God, through Moses, made a contract with. It is the linguistic root for the English word "laity," as opposed to "clergy" or "the priesthood."
    * **this report**  - A more literal translation would be "this word," "this message" or "this communication."
    * **about him** - That is, "about Jesus."
    * **went forth** - This could also be translated as "was spread"
    * **This report about him went forth** - This could also be translated as "People told this report about him."
    * **told him** - That is, "told John."
