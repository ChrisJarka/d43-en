=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

**Paul Continues his Defense**

Paul says that he wants to present the Corinthian believers to Christ as pure and good. But he is afraid that false teachers, claiming to be super-apostles will deceive them and get them away from believing the truth, to believing in lies. He says it is foolish to boast but he will speak like a fool because the false apostles are speaking like fools. But these false teachers are not as good as Paul. He has suffered more for Christ then they all have. And he lists the very many things he has suffered for preaching the Gospel of Christ.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphor ==

Paul begins the chapter with an extended [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]] of a father of the bride giving a pure, virgin bride to her groom.. 


== Irony ==

This chapter is very full of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony|irony]].  Paul is hoping to shame the Corinthian believers with his irony. "You tolerate these things well enough!" Paul thinks that they should not tolerate the way the false [[:en:obe:kt:apostle|apostles]] treated them. Paul does not think they are really apostles at all. The statement, "For you gladly put up with fools. You are wise yourselves!" means that the Corinthian believers think they were very wise but Paul does not agree. "I will say to our shame that we were too weak to do that" Paul is speaking about behavior he thinks is very wrong in order to avoid it. He is speaking as if he thinks he is wrong for not doing it. He used a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] also as irony. "Did I sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted?"

== Rhetorical questions ==

In refuting the false apostles' claims of superiority, Paul used a series of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|rhetorical questions]] coupled with an answer: "Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as though I were out of my mind.) I am more." He also used a series of rhetorical questions to express empathy with his converts: "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who has caused another to fall into sin, and I do not burn within?"
