He decided long ago to do that. It was exactly what he planned. He accomplishes everything exactly as he plans and desires,
\v 12 in order that we\f + \ft exclusive \f* Jews, who confidently expected the Messiah to do great things for us before the non-Jews expected such things \f + \ft Or: we \add ( inclusive )\add* who were already confidently expecting Christ \add to do great things for us\add* \f* will praise him for his greatness.

<usfm>
\v 11 Long ago God chose us to be joined to Christ, just as he had plannedâ€”and he always does exactly what he wishes to do.
\v 12 He did those so that the Jews, who confidently expected the Messiah to come and save them before the non-Jews knew anything about Christ, would praise him for his kindness.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 In Christ we were chosen and decided on beforehand. This was according to the plan of the one who does all things by the purpose of his will.

\v 12 God did this so that we might exist for the praise of his glory. We were the first to have confidence in Christ.
