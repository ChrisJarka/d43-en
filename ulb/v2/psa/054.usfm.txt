\d For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David; when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not David
hide himself with us?
\q
\v 1 Save me, O God, by your name,
\q And judge me in your might.
\q
\v 2 Hear my prayer, O God;
\q Give ear to the words of my mouth.
\q
\v 3 For strangers are risen up against me,
\q And violent men have sought after my soul:
\q They have not set God before them. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 Behold, God is my helper:
\q The Lord is of them that uphold my soul.
\q
\v 5 He will requite the evil to mine enemies:
\q Destroy you them in your truth.
\q
\v 6 With a free will offering will I sacrifice to thee:
\q I will give thanks to your name, O Jehovah, for it is good.
\q
\v 7 For he has delivered me out of all trouble;
\q And mine eye has seen my desire upon mine enemies.
