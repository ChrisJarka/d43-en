\v 15 Some of us believers were born as Jews. We were not born as non-Jews. We Jews have always considered non-Jews to be 'sinners' because they do not obey the Jewish rituals and laws.
\v 16 But we now know that it is not because some person obeys the laws that God gave to Moses that God erases the record of that person's sins. God erases the record of a person's sins only if that person trusts in what Jesus Christ has done. Even we Jews trusted Christ Jesus. We did that in order that God would erase the record of our sins because of our trusting Christ, and not because of our obeying the laws that God gave to Moses. God has said that he will never erase the record of people's sins just because of their obeying those laws.

\v 15 We are Jews by nature and not sinners of the Gentiles,
\v 16 yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith of Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus that we might be justified by faith of Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law  no flesh will be justified.
