\v 6 Then Achish called David, and said to him, As Jehovah liveth, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming
in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this
day: nevertheless the lords favor you not.
\v 7 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that you displease not the lords of the Philistines.
