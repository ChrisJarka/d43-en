===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Do not be like a horse ... no understanding** - The writer compares people with no understanding to farm animals. Possible meanings are 1) the writer is speaking Yahweh's words to his readers, "You all must not be like a horse ... no understanding" (see [[:en:bible:notes:psa:032:011|32:11]]), or 2) Yahweh is speaking to the writer as though to a group of people (see [[:en:bible:notes:psa:032:007|32:8]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **bridle and bit** - Two tools that are used by people to make horses and mules do their work.
  * **where you want them to** - The "you" here is singular and refers to no one in particular, "where anyone wants them to."
  * **will surround** - AT: "will always be near to" or "will guide" or "will protect"
