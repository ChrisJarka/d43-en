\c 149
\q
\v 1 Praise you Jehovah.
\q Sing to Jehovah a new song,
\q And his praise in the assembly of the saints.
\q
\v 2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him:
\q Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
\q
\v 3 Let them praise his name in the dance:
\q Let them sing praises to him with timbrel and harp.
\q
\v 4 For Jehovah takes pleasure in his people:
\q He will beautify the meek with salvation.
\q
\v 5 Let the saints exult in glory:
\q Let them sing for joy upon their beds.
\q
\v 6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth,
\q And a two-edged sword in their hand;
\q
\v 7 To execute vengeance upon the nations,
\q And punishments upon the peoples;
\q
\v 8 To bind their kings with chains,
\q And their nobles with fetters of iron;
\q
\v 9 To execute upon them the judgment written:
\q This honor have all his saints.
\q Praise you Jehovah.
