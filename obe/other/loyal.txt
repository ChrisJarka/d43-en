  * Abraham sent his oldest servant Eliezer with ten camels to Nahor to find a wife for his son Isaac among Abraham's relatives.  At Nahor, a woman named Rebekah carried water for the camels.  God guided Eliezer in making arrangements with Rebekah's family to be the one for Isaac, but, before finalizing any decisions, Eliezer asked Rebekah if she would be loyal to Isaac.  If not, Eliezer would countinue to look elsewhere.  Rebekah said that she would be loyal, and arrangements were made for her to return with Eliezer to marry Isaac.
