\v 31 And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let
us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: perhaps he will
save your life.
\v 32 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and
said, Your servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
