<usfm>
\v 30 And you, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothest yourself with scarlet, yough you deckest you with ornaments of gold, yough you enlargest your eyes with paint, in vain do you make yourself fair; your lovers despise thee, they seek your life.
\v 31 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her that brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that gaspeth for breath, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul fainteth before the murderers.
