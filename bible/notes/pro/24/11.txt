\q
\v 11 Save those who are being taken away to death—
\q those who are staggering to the slaughter—if you can hold them back.
\q
\v 12 If you say, "But we knew nothing about this."
\q Does not he who weighs the heart understand what you are saying?
\q And he who guards your life, does he not know it?
\q And will he not render to each one according to what he has done?
\q
\v 13 My son, eat honey because it is good
\q and the drippings of honeycomb are sweet to your taste.
\q
\v 14 Such is wisdom for your soul—
\q if you find it, there will be a future,
\q and your hope will not be cut off.
