  * Judaism includes all the laws that the LORD God gave to the Israelites to obey. It also includes the customs and traditions that have been added to the Jewish religion over time.
  * When translating, the term "Jewish religion" or "religion of the Jews" can be used in both the Old and New Testaments. The term "Judaism" should only be used in the New Testament since that term did not exist before that.
