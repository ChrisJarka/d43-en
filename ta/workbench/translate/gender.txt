===== Description =====

In some languages a word that normally refers to men is used to refer to a group of people, even though that group might have females in it. For example, in some languages, the word 'brother' usually refers to a male. There is a separate word for 'sister,' and it refers to a female. But the plural form 'brothers' can be used to refer to a group that has only males in it, or to a group that has both males and females. 

However some languages cannot use the word "brothers" to refer to a group of both males and females. They use the word "brothers" only to refer to a group of males. When they want to refer to a group of both males and females, they use "brothers and sisters."

Also in some languages "he" can be used for any person if the gender of the person is not important,  but in other languages, "he" could only refer to a male. (What I wrote below is not a real example -- just an idea. )
  * Whoever does ..., he will ...' 
  * Whoever does ..., they will  ... -  To avoid the impression that "whoever" and "he" could only refer to a male, English uses "they" because it does not show gender.

**Translation Principles**


==== Examples from the Bible ====

> __The wise man__ dies just like the fool dies. (Ecclesiastes 2:16 ULB)
This verse does not contrast men and women. What it says is true of both. In some languages, if the word "man" is used, people would think that this is only true about men, and not about women too.  

>He said to them all, "If anyone wants to come after me, __he__ must deny __himself__, take up __his__ cross daily, and follow me. Whoever would try to save __his__ life will lose it, but whoever loses __his__ life for my sake, __he__ will save it. What does it benefit a __man__, if __he__ gains the whole world, but loses or forfeits __his__ own self? (Matthew 16:24-26 ULB)

Jesus was not talking about only men. He wanted men and women to follow him.
