\v 6 This makes you glad, even though now it is necessary for you to feel sorrow because of many different trials.
\v 7 Trials test your faith. Your faith is much more precious than gold that is lost through fire. Fire tests your faith also, but your faith will result in praise, glory, and honor to Jesus Christ at his unveiling*.
