\v 20 Yahweh instructed me to proclaim this message to the people of Israel and Judah,
\q1
\v 21 "Listen to this, you people who are foolish and who do not have any sense:
\q2 You have eyes, but it is as though you cannot see;
\q2 you have ears, but it is as though you cannot hear.
\q1
\v 22 Why do you not have any awesome respect for me?
\q2 You should tremble when you are in my presence!
\q1 I, Yahweh, am the one who put a barrier along the shores
\q2 so that the waters of the ocean cannot cross it and flood the land.
\q1 The waves roll and roar, but they cannot go past that barrier.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 20 Report this to the house of Jacob and let it be heard in Judah. Say,
\q
\v 21 'Hear this, foolish people! For idols have no will;
\q there are eyes in them, but they cannot see. There are ears on them, but they do not hear.
\q
\v 22 Do you not fear me—this is Yahweh's declaration—or tremble before my face?
\q I have placed a border of sand against the sea, an ongoing decree that it does not violate—
\q even though the sea rises and falls, still it does not violate it. Even though its waves roar, they do not cross it.
