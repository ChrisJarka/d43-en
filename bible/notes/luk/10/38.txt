===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Now as the went on their way** - That is, "As Jesus and his disciples went on their way."
    * **he entered** - That is, "Jesus entered." This could also be translated as "Jesus and his disciples went into."
    * **who also sat at the Lord's feet**  - That is "who sat with the others at the Lord's feet." Mary was humble, respected Jesus, and assumed the position of a learner. Hence the translation should get across these ideas.
    * **heard his word**-  That is, "was listening to him"  or "was listening to what Jesus said." She gave him her attention.
