<usfm>
\v 13 You people of Judah and Israel, the people of other nations think of you when they speak of what a curse means. But I will rescue you, and I will give you many good things. So do not be afraid; work hard to finish building the temple."
\p
\v 14 Yahweh, the Commander of the angel armies, also says this: "When your ancestors caused me to become very angry, I did not change my mind about that. Instead, I indeed punished them.
\v 15 But now I will do something different. I am planning to do good things to the people of Jerusalem and other towns in Judah again. So do not be afraid.

\q
\v 13 You were an example to the other nations of a curse,
\q house of Judah and house of Israel.
\q So I will rescue you and you will be a blessing.
\q Do not be afraid; let your hands be strong!
\q
\v 14 For Yahweh of hosts says this: 
\q Just as I planned to do harm to you when your ancestors provoked my anger
\q —says Yahweh of hosts—and did not relent,
\q 
\v 15 so also I will plan in these days 
\q to do good again to Jerusalem and the house of Judah! 
\q Do not fear!
