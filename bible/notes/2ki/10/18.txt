\v 18 Then Jehu summoned all the people \add of Samaria\add*, and said to them, "King Ahab was devoted to \add your god\add* Baal a little bit, but I will serve him much more.
\v 19 So now summon all the prophets of Baal, all of Baal's priests, and all the others who worship Baal. I am going to make a great sacrifice to Baal. I want all of them to be there. Any of them who is not there will be executed." But Jehu was planning to trick them; he was planning to kill all those who worshiped Baal.
\p
\v 20 Then Jehu commanded, "Announce that we are going to set aside a day to honor Baal." So they did that.

\v 18 And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.
\v 19 Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I
have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to
the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
\v 20 And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
