===== Description =====

Connecting words show how thoughts are related to other thoughts. This page is about connecting words that connect statements and groups of statements to others. Examples of connecting words include: and, but, for, so, therefore, now, if, if only, since, then, when, while, whenever, because, yet, unless, like, and many more.
  * It was raining, __so__ I opened my umbrella.
  * It was raining, __but__ I did not have an umbrella. So I got very wet.

Sometimes people do not use a connecting word when they expect the readers to understand the relationship because of the content.
  * It was raining. I didn't have an umbrella. I got very wet.

**Reason this is a translation issue**
  * Translators need to understand the meaning of a connecting word in the Bible and the relationship between the thoughts it is connecting.
  * Each language has its own ways of showing how thoughts are related.
  * Translators need to know how to help their readers understand the relationship between the thoughts.

**Translation Principles**
  * Translators need to translate in a way that readers can understand the same relationship between thoughts that the original readers would have understood.
  * Whether or not a connecting word is used is not as important as readers being able to understand the relationship between the ideas.
===== Translation Strategies =====

If the way the relationship between thoughts is shown in the ULB would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, then consider using it. If not, here are some other options.\\

  - Use a connecting word (even if the ULB does not use one). 
  - Do not use a connecting word if it would be odd to use one and people would understand the right relationship between the thoughts without it.
  - Use a different connecting word. 


===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Use a connecting word (even if the ULB does not use one). 

  * **Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men." Immediately they left the nets and went after him.** (Mark 1:17-18) - They followed Jesus because he told them to. Some translators may want to mark this with "so."
    * "Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men." __So__ immediately they left the nets and went after him."

2. Do not use a connecting word if it would be odd to use one and people would understand the right relationship between the thoughts without it.

  * **Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil. Immediately they sprang up, __because__ the soil had no depth.** (Matthew 13:5) - If it would be obvious to people that the reason the seeds sprang up immediately was that the soil was shallow, then it may not be necessary to use the word "because." 
    * "Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil. The soil had no depth and they sprang up immediately. 


3. Use a different connecting word. 

  * **Therefore whoever breaks the least one of these commandments and teaches others to do so, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. __But__ whoever keeps them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.** (Matthew 5:19)  - The word "but" is used here because of the contrast between the two groups of people. But in some languages, the word "but" would show that what comes after it is surprising because of what came before it. So "and" might be clearer for those languages.
    * "Therefore whoever breaks the least one of these commandments and teaches others to do so, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. __And__ whoever keeps them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

  * **__Since__ the captain could not tell anything because of all the noise, he ordered that Paul be brought into the fortress.** (Acts 21:34) - Instead of starting the first part of the sentence with "since", some translators might prefer to start the second part of the sentence with "so". 
    * "The captain could not tell anything because of all the noise, __so__ he ordered that Paul be brought into the fortress."
