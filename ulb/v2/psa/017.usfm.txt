\c 17
\d A Prayer of David.
\q
\v 1 Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend to my cry;
\q Give ear to my prayer, that goes not out of feigned lips.
\q
\v 2 Let my sentence come forth from your presence;
\q Let your eyes look upon equity.
\q
\v 3 You have proved my heart; you have visited me in the night;
\q You have tried me, and find nothing;
\q I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
\q
\v 4 As for the works of men, by the word of your lips
\q I have kept me from the ways of the violent.
\q
\v 5 My steps have held fast to your paths,
\q My feet have not slipped.
\q
\v 6 I have called upon thee, for you will answer me, O God:
\q Incline your ear to me, and hear my speech.
\q
\v 7 Show your marvelous lovingkindness,
\q O you that save by your right hand them that take refuge in you

\q From those that rise up against them.
\q
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of the eye;
\q Hide me under the shadow of your wings,
\q
\v 9 From the wicked that oppress me,
\q My deadly enemies, that compass me about.
\q
\v 10 They are inclosed in their own fat:
\q With their mouth they speak proudly.
\q
\v 11 They have now compassed us in our steps;
\q They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.
\q
\v 12 He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,
\q And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
\q
\v 13 Arise, O Jehovah,
\q Confront him, cast him down:
\q Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword;
\q
\v 14 From men by your hand, O Jehovah,
\q From men of the world, whose portion is in this life,
\q And whose belly you fill with your treasure:
\q They are satisfied with children,
\q And leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
\q
\v 15 As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness;
\q I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with beholding your form.
