\v 5 The men of Gibeah attacked me, and surrounded the house around me by night. They were intending to kill me and rape my concubine, and now she is dead.
\v 6 I took my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel, for those people have committed this obscene act, this wickedness, in Israel.
\v 7 See, you people of Israel, all of you, give us here your advice and plans.‚Äù
