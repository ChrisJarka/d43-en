===== What to Start Translating =====

This module answers the question: What do I start translating?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_manual|Introduction to Translation Manual]]

==== What To Start Translating ====

We recommend that you begin by translating Open Bible Stories. You can work your way through the Stories in whatever order that you want, but we have found [[:en:obs:31|Story #31]] (https://door43.org/en/obs/31) is a good first story to translate since it is short and easy to understand.

==== Translate from the Source Language ====

Note: 

   * "Source Language" refers to the language from which the translation is being done.
   * "Target Language" refers to the language into which the translation is being done.

After you find your target language and make sure that it is [[https://door43.org/obs-setup|set up]] (https://door43.org/obs-setup) on Door43, you can then choose the source language from a list of approved source languages. After that has been set up, the page for the target language translation will have the text of Open Bible Stories on it from the source language. The translator can then translate from the source language into the target language on that same page, and then delete the source language when translation is completed. 



Next we recommend you learn about:
