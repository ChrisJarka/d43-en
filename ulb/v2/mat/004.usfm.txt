\v 1 Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
\v 2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered.
\v 3 And the tempter came and said to him, If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.
\v 4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
mouth of God.
\v 5 Then the devil takes him into the holy city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
\v 6 and says to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down: for it is written,
\q He shall give his angels charge concerning thee:
\m and,
\q On their hands they shall bear you up,
\q Lest haply you dash your foot against a stone.
\m
\v 7 Jesus said to him, Again it is written, You shall not make trial of the Lord your God.
\v 8 Again, the devil takes him to an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory
of them;
\v 9 and he said to him, All these things will I give thee, if you will fall down and worship me.
\v 10 Then says Jesus to him, Get you hence, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only
shall you serve.
\v 11 Then the devil leaves him; and behold, angels came and ministered to him.
\p
\v 12 Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee;
\v 13 and leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali:
\v 14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\q
\v 15 The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
\q Toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,
\q Galilee of the Gentiles,
\q
\v 16 The people that sat in darkness
\q Saw a great light,
\q And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death,
\q To them did light spring up.
\p
\v 17 From that time began Jesus to preach, and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
\p
\v 18 And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net
into the sea; for they were fishers.
\v 19 And he says to them, Come you after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
\v 20 And they straightway left the nets, and followed him.
\v 21 And going on from thence he saw two other brethren, James the
son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
\v 22 And they straightway left the boat and their father, and followed him.
\p
\v 23 And Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing
all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people.
\v 24 And the report of him went forth into all Syria: and they brought to him all that were sick, holden with various
diseases and torments, possessed with demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he healed them.
\v 25 And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and
from beyond the Jordan.
