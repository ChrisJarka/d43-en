===== Description =====

Remember that nouns are words that refer to a person, place, thing, or idea. **ABSTRACT NOUNS** are nouns that refer to attitudes, qualities, events, situations, or even to relationships among these ideas. These are things that cannot be seen or touched in a physical sense, such as joy, peace, creation, goodness, contentment, justice, truth, freedom, vengeance, slowness, length, and weight.\\

Hint: English uses common word endings (suffixes) that may help identify some abstract nouns. They include such endings as: -tion; -ism; -ity; -ment; -ness; -age; -ance; -ence; -ship; -ability; -acy.

Abstract nouns allow us to express thoughts about ideas in fewer words than if we did not have those nouns. For example, we can say, “I believe in the forgiveness of sin.” But if English did not have the two abstract nouns “forgiveness” and “sin,” then we would have to make a longer sentence to express the same meaning. We would have to say, for example, “I believe that God is willing to forgive people after they have sinned.” 

**Reason this is a translation issue**: The Bible that you translate from may use abstract nouns to express certain ideas. Your language might not use abstract nouns for some of those ideas; instead, it might use phrases to express those ideas. Those phrases will have other kinds of words such as adjectives, verbs, or adverbs, that express some of the meaning in the abstract noun.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**from __childhood__ you have known the sacred writings** (2 Timothy 3:15) \\  
The abstract noun "childhood" refers to when someone is a child.

**But __godliness__ with __contentment__ is great __gain__.** (1 Timothy 6:6)  \\ 
The abstract nouns "godliness" and "contentment" refer to being godly and content. \\
The abstract noun "gain" refers to something that benefits or helps someone.

**Today __salvation__ has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.** (Luke 19:9) \\

  - Reword the sentence with a phrase that expresses the meaning of the abstract noun.
