\v 22 Look! All the women who remain in the house of the king of Judah will be brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon. Then look! They will say,
\q They have misled you! For the men peaceful towards you have defeated you!
\q Your feet will be planted in the mire; they will flee backwards!
\v 23 For all of your wives and your children will be brought out to the Chaldeans and you yourself will not escape from their hand, for you will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon and cause this city to be burned by fire!‚Äù
