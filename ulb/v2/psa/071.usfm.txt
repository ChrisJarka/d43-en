\q
\v 1 In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge:
\q Let me never be put to shame.
\q
\v 2 Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me:
\q Bow down your ear to me, and save me.
\q
\v 3 Be you to me a rock of habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:
\q You have given commandment to save me;
\q For you are my rock and my fortress.
\q
\v 4 Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked,
\q Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
\q
\v 5 For you are my hope, O Lord Jehovah:
\q You are my trust from my youth.
\q
\v 6 By you have I been holden up from the womb;
\q You are he that took me out of my motherâ€™s bowels:
\q My praise shall be continually of thee.
\q
\v 7 I am as a wonder to many;
\q But you are my strong refuge.
\q
\v 8 My mouth shall be filled with your praise,
\q And with your honor all the day.
\q
\v 9 Cast me not off in the time of old age;
\q Forsake me not when my strength faileth.
\q
\v 10 For mine enemies speak concerning me;
\q And they that watch for my soul take counsel together,
\q
\v 11 Saying, God has forsaken him:
\q Pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver.
\q
\v 12 O God, be not far from me;
\q O my God, make haste to help me.
\q
\v 13 Let them be put to shame and consumed that are adversaries to my soul;
\q Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt.
\q
\v 14 But I will hope continually,
\q And will praise you yet more and more.
\q
\v 15 My mouth shall tell of your righteousness,
\q And of your salvation all the day;
\q For I know not the numbers thereof.
\q
\v 16 I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Jehovah:
\q I will make mention of your righteousness, even of your only.
\q
\v 17 O God, you have taught me from my youth;
\q And hitherto have I declared your wondrous works.
\q
\v 18 Yea, even when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not,
\q Until I have declared your strength to the next generation,
\q Your might to every one that is to come.
\q
\v 19 Your righteousness also, O God, is very high;
\q You who have done great things, O God, who is like to thee?
\q
\v 20 Thou, who have showed us many and sore troubles,
\q Wilt quicken us again,
\q And will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.
\q
\v 21 Increase you my greatness,
\q And turn again and comfort me.
\q
\v 22 I will also praise you with the psaltery,
\q Even your truth, O my God:
\q To you will I sing praises with the harp,
\q O you Holy One of Israel.
\q
\v 23 My lips shall shout for joy when I sing praises to thee;
\q And my soul, which you have redeemed.
\q
\v 24 My tongue also shall talk of your righteousness all the day long;
\q For they are put to shame, for they are confounded, that seek my hurt.
