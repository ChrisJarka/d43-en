<usfm>
\v 1 Now \add I will answer what you asked\add* about \add us believers\add* eating meat that has been sacrificed to idols. \add We know what some of you say, that God has enabled\add* all of us\add to\add* know \add the truth about things such as idols. But often we become\add* proud because we say that we know \add all those things\add*. But instead of being proud about what we know, we should show that we love \add our fellow believers by helping them to\add* become spiritually mature.
\v 2 Those who think that they thoroughly know something do not yet know it as they should.
\v 3 But as for those who love God, they know that they belong to him.

\v 1 Now, about the question you asked regarding eating food that was offered to idols: We know the popular quote that says, "We all have knowledge." But knowledge alone can puff us up with pride; but love builds us up.
\v 2 Another saying is, "If a person thinks he knows something, he does not yet know what is important."
\v 3 When you love God, he knows you, for God knows everyone he loves.
