===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Man**  - This is a general term of address that your language might have a more appropriate word for. Similar English words might be "friend" or "sir."
    * **your sins are forgiven you**  - This literally means "your sins are released to you."  It could be stated as "I forgive your sins" or "I release your sins", but the original words were not expressed in this way.
    * **Sins **- Sin means “missing the mark,” like a bullet missing its target.
    * **forgiven **- That is, "have been forgiven."
    * **question**  - Or, "debate among themselves."
