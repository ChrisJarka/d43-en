\v 11 And it was so, that, at what time the chest was brought to the king’s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when
they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it,
and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
\v 12 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they hired masons
and carpenters to restore the house of Jehovah, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of Jehovah.
