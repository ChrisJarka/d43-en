===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Did you bring me sacrifices ... Israel?** - God uses this  to remind his people that he did not require the Israelites to make sacrifices when they were in the wilderness. AT: "You did not bring me sacrifices ... Israel." or "You did not have to bring me sacrifices ... Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Did you bring** - God speaks as though the Israelites he is speaking to were part of the group that wandered in the wilderness. AT: "Did your ancestors" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to Israel's descendants. See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:05:01|5:1]]. AT: "you people of Israel" or "you Israelite people group" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Sikkuth ... Kaiwan** - pagan gods (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Kaiwan** - Or "Kiyyun"
