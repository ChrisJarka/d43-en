\v 11 Wherefore Jehovah said to Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and you have not kept my covenant and my
statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to your servant.
\v 12 Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it, for David your father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of your son.
\v 13 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for David my servant’s sake, and for
Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.
