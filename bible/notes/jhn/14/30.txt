\v 30 I will not be able to talk with you much longer because the ruler of this world is coming. However, he has no power over me,
\v 31 and I will do what the Father has commanded me to do. This is so that the world will know forever that I love the Father. Come, let us go from here."

\v 30 I will not speak much more with you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no power over me,
