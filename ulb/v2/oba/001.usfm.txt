\v 1 The vision of Obadiah.
\p Thus says the Lord Jehovah concerning Edom: We have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the
nations, saying, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.
\v 2 Behold, I have made you small among the nations: you are greatly despised.
\v 3 The pride of your heart has deceived thee, O you that live in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that
says in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
\v 4 Though you mount on high as the eagle, and yough your nest be set among the stars, I will bring you down from thence,
says Jehovah.
\p
\v 5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night (how are you cut off!), would they not steal
only till they had enough? if grape gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes?
\v 6 How are the things of Esau searched! how are his hidden treasures sought out!
\v 7 All the men of your confederacy have brought you on your way, even to the border: the men that were at peace with you have
deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat your bread lay a snare under thee: there is no understanding
in him.
\v 8 Shall I not in that day, says Jehovah, destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
\v 9 And your mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by
slaughter.
\p
\v 10 For the violence done to your brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and you shall be cut off for ever.
\v 11 In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners
entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even you was as one of them.
\v 12 But look not you on the day of your brother in the day of his disaster, and rejoice not over the children of Judah in the
day of their destruction; neither speak proudly in the day of distress.
\v 13 Enter not into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, look not you on their affliction in the day of
their calamity, neither lay you hands on their substance in the day of their calamity.
\v 14 And stand you not in the crossway, to cut off those of his that escape; and deliver not up those of his that remain in
the day of distress.
\p
\v 15 For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations: as you have done, it shall be done to thee; your dealing shall
return upon your own head.
\v 16 For as you have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink continually; youa, they shall drink, and
swallow down, and shall be as though they had not been.
\p
\v 17 But in mount Zion there shall be those that escape, and it shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their
possessions.
\v 18 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they
shall burn among them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining to the house of Esau; for Jehovah has spoken it.
\v 19 And they of the South shall possess the mount of Esau, and they of the lowland the Philistines; and they shall possess
the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria; and Benjamin shall
possess Gilead.
\v 20 And the captives of this host of the children of Israel, that are
among the Canaanites, shall possess even to Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, that are in
Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the South.
\v 21 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be Jehovahâ€™s.
