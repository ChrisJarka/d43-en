\c 113
\q
\v 1 Praise you Jehovah.
\q Praise, O you servants of Jehovah,
\q Praise the name of Jehovah.
\q
\v 2 Blessed be the name of Jehovah
\q From this time forth and for evermore.
\q
\v 3 From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same
\q Jehovahâ€™s name is to be praised.
\q
\v 4 Jehovah is high above all nations,
\q And his glory above the heavens.
\q
\v 5 Who is like to Jehovah our God,
\q That has his seat on high,
\q
\v 6 That humbles himself to behold
\q The things that are in heaven and in the earth?
\q
\v 7 He raises up the poor out of the dust,
\q And lifts up the needy from the dunghill;
\q
\v 8 That he may set him with princes,
\q Even with the princes of his people.
\q
\v 9 He makes the barren woman to keep house,
\q And to be a joyful mother of children.
\q Praise you Jehovah.
