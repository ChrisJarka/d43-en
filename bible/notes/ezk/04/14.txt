\v 14 Then I said, "No, Yahweh God! \add Do not force me to do that\add*! I have never caused myself to become unacceptable to you. From the time when I was young, I have never eaten meat of any animal that was found dead or that had been killed by wild animals. And I have never eaten any meat that is unacceptable to you."
\p
\v 15 Yahweh replied, "Okay, I will allow you to bake your bread using dried cow manure instead of human dung \add for fuel\add*."

\v 14 But I said, "Alas, Lord Yahweh! My soul has never been unclean! I have never eaten either anything that died or anything killed by animals, 
from my youth until now, and foul meat has never entered my mouth!"
\v 15 So he said to me, "Look! I have given you cow’s dung instead of man’s dung so you can prepare your bread over the cow's dung."
