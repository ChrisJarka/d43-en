<usfm>
\v 1 So, because God has acted so kindly \add toward me\add* enabling \add me to teach\add* this great \add message to people\add*, I never get \add so\add* discouraged \add that I stop teaching it\add*.
\v 2 And I have determined that we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* will be honest \f + \ft litotes \f* in everything that we do. We will not \add do anything that would cause\add* us to be ashamed \add if people found out about it\add*. We never try to deceive \add you with clever arguments, as some other people do\add*. We never \add try to deceive you\add* by changing God's message, \add as those same people do\add*. Instead, we always teach \add people only\add* the truth \add about Christ\add*, and we teach it clearly. Knowing that God is watching what we do, we \add teach his message in an honest way, with the result that\add* no one can \add accuse\add* us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* of being deceitful\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 God gave us this responsbility to carry out, and he also had mercy on us. So we are not down-hearted.
\v 2 We are careful not to do anything we would be ashamed of doing, and we have nothing to hide from anyone. We do not promise something that God will not give, and we do not twist God's message to make it say what we want. We proclaim only the truth. In this way, we present ourselves for you to judge us as we stand before God.

\p
\v 1 Therefore, because we have this ministry, and  just as we have received mercy, we do not become discouraged.
\v 2 Instead, we have renounced the ways that are shameful and hidden. We do not live by craftiness, and we do not mishandle the word of God. By presenting the truth, we recommend ourselves to everyoneâ€™s conscience in the sight of God.
