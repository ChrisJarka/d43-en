\v 17 Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where will you that we make
ready for you to eat the passover?
\v 18 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover
at your house with my disciples.
\v 19 And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
