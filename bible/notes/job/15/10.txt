===== translationNotes: =====

  * **With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men** - Eliphaz speaks of him and the other men having learned wisdom from older men and wisdom that had been passed down from men of previous generations as if these older men were physically present with them. AT: "We acquired wisdom from old gray-haired people, from people who were born before your father was" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Are the consolations of God ... gentle toward you?** - This rhetorical question is an accusation, with the implicit answer to the question being "yes." This question may be written as a statement. AT: "You must think that the consolations of God are too small for you, the words that are gentle toward you"
  * **consolations** - "comforts" or "sympathies"
