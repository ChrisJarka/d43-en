\v 6 And concerning the younger men, instruct them, too. Call the younger men to take into account everything that we teach and to be balanced in the way they think as they decide what to do in life.
\v 7 As for you,Titus, my son, present yourself as an example of someone who does good work and who cannot be corrupted as you teach the believers sincerely and seriously.
\v 8 Give instruction that does not need to be corrected and that would bring shame upon anyone who might try to oppose you, since there would be nothing bad to say about us.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 In the same way, call the younger men to be sensible.
\v 7 In all things present yourself as a model of good works, and when you teach, be a model of dignity. And make sure that what you teach is pure and right.
\v 8 Speak words that do not need to be corrected but that would bring shame upon someone if he tried to oppose you, because there is nothing evil to say about us.
