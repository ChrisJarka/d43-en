\v 11 It was because Abraham trusted God that God gave Abraham strength so that he \add was\add* able to produce a son. Even though his wife Sarah was beyond the time \add when women bear children\add*, \add God\add* promised \add that he would give her a son\add*, and Abraham considered that God would do what he promised to do.
\v 12 So, although Abraham was too old to have children, from that one man people descended who are as many in number as the stars in the sky and are as countless as the grains of sand along the shore, \add just like God promised him\add*.

\v 11 By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive even when she was past age, since she considered him faithful who had promised.
\v 12 Therefore as many as the stars in heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sands by the sea shore were born descendants from one man, and him as good as dead.
