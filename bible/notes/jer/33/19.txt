\v 19 Then Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 20 "This is what I, Yahweh, say: 'You certainly cannot annul my promise\f + \ft Or: agreement \f* to cause nighttime to follow daytime each day.
\v 21 Similarly, you cannot annul the promise\f + \ft Or: agreement \f* that I made with King David, who served me well, that there will always be descendants of his who will rule \add Judah\add*. The same is true for my agreement with the descendants of Levi who are priests who do work for me.
\v 22 No one can count the stars in the sky, and no one can count the grains of sand at the seashore. Similarly, I will cause there to be a huge number of descendants of David and descendants of Levi who will work for me.'~"

\p
\v 19 And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,
\v 20 Thus says Jehovah: If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day
and night in their season;
\v 21 then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne; and
with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
\v 22 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David my
servant, and the Levites that minister to me.
