<usfm>
\v 14 So when the \add Israelite\add* people packed up their tents in order to cross the river, the priests who were carrying the chest containing the Ten Commandments went in front of them.
\v 15 It \add was springtime\add*, when people harvest their crops, and at that time the river floods over its banks. But as soon as the priests reached the edge of the river and stepped into the water,
\v 16 the water stopped flowing. The water piled up far \add upstream\add*, at a town named Adam, near Zarethan. The water stopped flowing down to the Dead Sea. So the people were able to cross the river near Jericho.

\v 14 So when the Israelite crossed the river, the priests who were carrying sacred chest went in front of them.
\v 15 And as soon as the priests reached the edge of the Jordan river and stepped into the water (now it was the springtime, when the river floods over its banks),
\v 16 and the water stopped flowing and it piled up far upstream. The water did not flow in the Jordan from the town called Adam, near Zarethan, all the way down to the Sea of Arabah (which is called the Dead Sea), so the people were able to cross the river near Jericho.

\v 14 So when the people set out to cross over the Jordan, the priests that carried the chest of the covenant went ahead of the people.
\v 15 As soon as those who were carrying the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of those who carried the chest were dipped in the edge of the water (now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of the harvest),
\v 16 the waters that flowed down from upstream stood up in one pile. The water stopped flowing from a great distance. The waters stopped flowing from Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, all the way down to the sea of the Negev, the Salt Sea. And the people crossed over near Jericho.
