\v 16 To those who  \add are on the way to hell, our message is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a foul smell  \add because it is about dying\add* and being separated from God forever. But, to those\add on the way to heaven, the message that we teach is like\add* a pure fragrant smell, \add because we tell them\add* that they will live  \add forever with God. As we think about that, we think\add* no one can have enough ability  \add to do\add* such important work  \add for God!\add*\f + \ft Or: how can anyone have enough ability  \add to do\add* such important work  \add for God\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 17  \add But perhaps God considers us\f + \ft exclusive \f* sufficient\add*, because we do not work\f + \ft Or: act \f* like so many  \add others whom you know\add*. They teach God's message in a way that  \add they think people will like, and they think that\add* people will pay them for teaching that way. We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* certainly do not do that\add*. On the contrary, \add as servants of\add* Christ, and knowing that God is watching us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, we teach sincerely  \add the message that\add* God sent us to proclaim.
