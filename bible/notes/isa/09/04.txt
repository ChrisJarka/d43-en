===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to describe when God will save the people of Israel. Although these events would happen in the future, Isaiah describes them as if they already happened. This emphasizes that they certainly will happen. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:09:01|9:1-2]])
  * **For the yoke of his burden, the beam across his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have shattered** - The word "his" refers to the people of Israel. Isaiah includes himself as a part of Israel. Isaiah compares the slaves from Israel to oxen wearing yokes.  Alternate translation: "You will free the slaves from Israel like a person removing a yoke from an oxen, and you will shatter the rod of the one who oppresses us." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the yoke...the beam...the rod...you have shattered** -  Alternate translation: "The Lord will free the people of Judah from their burdens like a master who removes the yoke from his oxen or like a king who breaks an oppressor's rod." See: ([[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:simile]]).  Notice that the ULB uses "his," but the UDB "us" and "our" because Isaiah, who lived in Jerusalem, sees himself as belonging to the people of Judah. (See [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:inclusive]).
  * **as on the day of Midian** - "as when the Lord used Gideon, a judge in Israel, to conquer the Midianites" (See:[[en:obe:other:gideon]])
  * **every boot treading in the tumult and the garments rolled in blood will be burned** - The phrases "every boot" and "clothing covered with blood" may be metonymies for "every enemy soldier." Alternate translation: "The Lord will destroy all the enemy soldiers and their weapons of warfare" (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metonymy]] and [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metaphor]])   
  * **fuel for the fire** - The Lord's anger towards Judah's enemies is compared to a fire which destroys everything.  Alternate translation: "and used as fuel for his fire" (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:metaphor]])
