\v 28 Take you away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that has the ten talents.
\v 29 For to every one that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that has not, even that which he
has shall be taken away.
\v 30 And cast you out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
