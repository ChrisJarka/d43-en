===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Turn back, turn back** - "Come back, come back." This is repeated for emphasis.
  * **gaze** - look intently at something for a time
  * **as if I were dancing between two rows of dancers** - It would be a wonderful thing to see the woman dancing with the other dancers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
