====== unclean ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the term "unclean" is used figuratively to refer to things that God declared to be unfit for his people to touch, to eat or to sacrifice.

  * In the Old Testament God gave the Israelites many instructions about which animals were "clean" and which ones were "unclean." The unclean animals could not be used for eating or for sacrifice.
  * If an Israelites touched one of these "unclean" things, they themselves would be considered unclean for a certain period of time.
  * A Jewish priest who became unclean would not be permitted to perform his religious duties.
  * Obeying God's commands about not touching or eating unclean things kept the Israelites holy and set apart for God's service.
  * Touching a dead animal was physically unclean and God had declared it to also be ritually unclean. This physical and ritual uncleanness was symbolic of moral uncleanness.
  * An "unclean spirit" refers to an evil spirit, that is, a demon.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * The term "unclean" could also be translated as "not clean" or "unfit in God's eyes."
  * When referring to a demon as an unclean spirit, "unclean" could be translated as "evil."
  * Make sure the translation of this term does not imply that something is physically dirty. Rather it should be understood that this word refers to something that God declared as unfit or unsuitable for touching, eating or sacrifice.
