===== translationNotes: =====

  * **our mouths were filled with laughter** - AT: "we laughed and laughed" 
  * **our tongues with singing** - "our tongues were filled with singing." AT: "we sang and sang" or "we continually sang" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]]) 
  * **they said among the nations** - "the people of the nations said among themselves." The pronoun is used before introducing what it references. This is very unusual.
  * **Yahweh did great things for us; how glad we were!** - AT: "How glad we were, because Yahweh did these great things for us!"
