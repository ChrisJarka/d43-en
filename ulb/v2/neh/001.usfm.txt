\v 1 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.
\p Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
\v 2 that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had
escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
\v 3 And they said to me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and
reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.
\p
\v 4 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed
before the God of heaven,
\v 5 and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keeps covenant and
lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments:
\v 6 Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I pray
before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, while I confess the sins of the children of
Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my fatherâ€™s house have sinned:
\v 7 we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which
you commanded your servant Moses.
\v 8 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, If you trespass, I will scatter you
abroad among the peoples:
\v 9 but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the
heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell
there.
\v 10 Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.
\v 11 O Lord, I beseech thee, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants,
who delight to fear your name; and prosper, I pray thee, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.
\p Now I was cupbearer to the king.
