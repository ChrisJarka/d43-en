\v 8 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.
\v 9 For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they
shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man;
none shall return in vain.
\v 10 And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that prey upon her shall be satisfied, says Jehovah.
