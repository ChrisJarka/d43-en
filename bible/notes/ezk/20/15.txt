\v 15 I liften up my hand and solemnly declared to them in the desert that I would not take them into the land that I \add had promised to\add* give them, a land that was very fertile [IDI] and very beautiful\f + \ft Or: more beautiful than any other \f* land.
\v 16 The reason that I promised that was because they rejected and disobeyed all my laws \f + \ft doublet \f* and desecrated\f + \ft Or: refused to rest on \f* the Sabbath days. They did that because they \f + \ft synecdoche \f* were devoted to \add worshiping\add* their idols.
\v 17 But, I still pitied them and did not get rid of them in the desert.

<usfm>
\v 15 So I myself also lifted up my hand for them in the wilderness not to bring them into the land that I had given, flowing with milk and honey 
which was a beautiful ornament for all the lands.
\v 16 Because they rejected my judgments and did not walk in my statutes, and they profaned my Sabbaths since their hearts walked after 
their idols.
 
\v 17 But my eye had compassion for them from their destruction, so I did not annihilate them in the wilderness.
