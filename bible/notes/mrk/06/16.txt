\v 16 Having heard \add what the people were saying, King\add* Herod \add Antipas\add* himself repeatedly said, "The man \add performing those miracles\add* must be John! I \add commanded my soldiers to\add* cut off his head, but he has become alive again \add to get revenge for my killing him\add*!"
\v 17 The reason \add King Herod concluded that John wanted revenge is as follows: Some time before this\add*, Herod married Herodias, while she was \add still\add* the wife of his \add younger\add* brother, Philip.

\v 16 But when Herod heard this he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised."
\v 17 For Herod himself had sent for the arrest of John and he had tied him up in prison because of Herodias (his brother Philip's wife) because he had married her.
