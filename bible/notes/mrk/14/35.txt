===== Translation Notes: =====

At Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives Jesus has left Peter, James, and John to stay alert to pray.

  * **this hour might pass** - "he might be strengthened to endure the suffering he was experiencing"
  * **Abba** - "Abba" is a Greek term that is used by children to address their father. It implies a close relationship. Since it already addresses Father, it might be important to keep the Greek term, "Abba." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **Remove this cup from me** - The cup refers to the wrath of God Jesus must endure. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Jesus ... said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible with you. Remove this cup from me. But not my will, but yours."** - Jesus asked his Father to remove the cup of suffering he would have to endure on the cross to die for all the sins of humanity, for all time. Since the Father required the sacrifice of his only, perfect Son to satisfy God's infinite holiness, Jesus went to the cross and gave his life so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal forgiveness. Translate "Father" and "Son" literally, showing Jesus' intimate relationship with his Father.
