\v 4 Then it will happen in that day that each prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesizes and, so that they might deceive, they will no longer wear a hairy cloak.
\v 5 For he will say, 'I am not a prophet! I am a man who works the soil, for the land became my work while I was still a young man!'
\v 6 But someone will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?' and he will answer, 'I was wounded with those in my friends' house.'"
