\v 7 That explains why \add God said\add*, 'When a man \add and\add* woman marry, they should no longer live with their fathers and mothers \add after they marry\add*.
\v 8 Instead, the two of them shall \add live together, and they shall\add* become so\add closely united\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that they are like\add* one person.' Therefore, although the people \add who marry\add* were two \add separate persons\add* before, \add God regards them\add* as one person now, \add so he wants them to remain married\add*.
\v 9 Because that is true, a man must not separate from his \add wife\add* whom God has joined \add to him, because God's plan is for them to remain together\add*!"

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife-**  This phrase means that a man and his wife should be each other's primary relationship, and it should be even more significant that one's relationship with their father or mother. It does not mean that one must no longer be in relationship with one's parents.
