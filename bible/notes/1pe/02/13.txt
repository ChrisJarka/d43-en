\p
\v 13 Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lordâ€™s sake: whether to the king, as supreme;
\v 14 or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well.
\v 15 For so is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
\v 16 as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.
\v 17 Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
