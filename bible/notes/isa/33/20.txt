\v 20 Look at Zion, the city of our feasts: your eyes will see Jerusalem as a quiet habitation, a tent that will not be
removed, whose stakes of it willnever be pulled up or will any of its cords be broken.
\v 21 Instead,  Yahweh in majestywill be with us, in a place of broad rivers and streams. N o boat with oars will travel it,
and no  large ships wil sail by.
