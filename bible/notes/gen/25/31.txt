\v 31 Jacob said, "First sell me your birthright."
\v 32 Esau said, "Look, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?"
\v 33 Jacob said, "First swear to me," so Esau swore an oath and in that way he sold his birthright to Jacob.
\v 34 Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, then got up and went on his way. In this manner Esau despised his birthright.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **birthright**  - "right as firstborn to inherit most of our father's wealth" (UDB)
  * **I am about to die**  - Esau was exaggerating to emphasize how hungry he was. This could be translated as "I am so hungry I feel like I could die." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **What good is the birthright to me?**  - Esau used a question to emphasize that eating was more important than a birthright. This could be translated as a statement: "My inheritance is no good to me if I die of hunger!" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **First swear to me**  - What Jacob wanted Esau to swear can be stated explicitly: "First swear to me that you will sell me your birthright." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
  * **lentils**  - These are like beans, but there seeds are very small, round, and somewhat flat. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:translateunknowns|Unknowns - How to Translate]])
  * **Esau despised his birthright**  - "Esau thought his birthright was not important." Alternate translation: "Esau showed that he did value his birthright."
