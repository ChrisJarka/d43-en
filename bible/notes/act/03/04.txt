===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **fastening his eyes upon him**  - stared at him, looked intently at him, looked directly at him (UDB). This is a different word than, "looking at" in verse 4. It means "to pay close attention to." If "looking intently at" someone communicates "pay close attention to" in your language, it's a good translation. If "looking closely at" is rude, or means something else, it can be translated, "pay close attention to."
  * **silver and gold**  - This is placed at the beginning of the sentence to emphasize that this is what the man expects to receive but Peter does not have any, and to set up the contrast with what Peter does have and want to give him.
