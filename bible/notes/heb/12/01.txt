\v 1 We \add know about\add* many people like that\add who showed they trusted in God\add*. They are like a crowd of spectators \add who are cheering for us inside a stadium\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Knowing that, we must put away all the things that hinder us, \add as a runner puts aside everything that would hinder him because they are heavy\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Especially we must put away sinful actions that \add hinder us, as a runner\add* sets aside clothes he does not need, clothes that would entangle him \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Let us \add wholeheartedly strive to achieve what God has planned for us, as someone\add* in a race wholeheartedly runs the course that is before him \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 2 And let us \add keep our minds on\add* Jesus, \add as a runner\add* keeps his eyes on \add the goal\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. He is the one we should imitate concerning how he perfectly trusted \add God. When he died on\add* the cross he endured it when he suffered greatly \f + \ft metonymy \f*, instead of \add thinking about the things he would\add* rejoice about \add later\add*. He disregarded being disgraced by \add dying that way\add*. He is now sitting at the place of highest honor \f + \ft metonymy \f* at the throne \add where God rules\add*.


\p
\v 3 \add Jesus\add* patiently endured it when sinful people acted so hostilely against him. Compare yourselves with him so that you do not give up \add trusting\add* God or become discouraged.
\v 4 While you have struggled against \add being tempted to\add* sin, you have not yet bled \add and died because of resisting evil, as Jesus did\add*.
\v 5 Do not forget \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* these words \add that Solomon spoke to his son, that are the same as God\add* would exhort you as his children:
\q My child, pay attention \f + \ft litotes \f* when the Lord is disciplining you,
\q and do not be discouraged when the Lord punishes you \f + \ft doublet \f*,
\q
\v 6 because it is everyone whom he loves whom the Lord disciplines,
\q and he punishes everyone whom he accepts as his child.

\v 1 We know about many people like these who proved that they trusted in God. So we also must put away everything that hinders us. Especially we must stop doing anything that would keep us back, like a runner who takes off his clothes. Then let us patiently do everything that God gives us to do until we cross the finish line.
\v 2 And let us keep thinking about Jesus, as a runner keeps his eyes on the goal. He is the one whom we trust because he endured the intense suffering on the cross and ignored people who shamed him. He did this becuase he knew how joyful this would make others. He now sits at the place of highest honor beside the throne where God rules in heaven.


\p
\v 3 Jesus patiently endured it when sinful people hatefully acted against him. Strengthen your hearts and minds with Jesus' example so that you will not give up trusting God or become discouraged.
\v 4 While you have struggled against being tempted to sin, you have not yet bled and died because of resisting evil, as Jesus did.
\v 5 Do not forget these words that Solomon spoke to his son, which are the same with which God encourages you as his children:
\q "My child, pay attention when the Lord is disciplining you,
\q and do not be discouraged when the Lord punishes you,
\q
\v 6 because everyone whom the Lord loves he also disciplines,
\q and he punishes everyone whom he accepts as his child."

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a large crowd of witnesses, let us throw off everything that weighs us down and the sin that so easily entangles us. Let us patiently run the race that is placed before us.
\v 2 Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despised its shame, and sat down at the right side of the throne of God.
\v 3 For consider him who has endured such hateful speech from sinners against himself, so that you do not become weary or faint-hearted.
s5
\v 4 You have not yet resisted or struggled against sin to the point of losing blood.
\v 5 And you have forgotten the encouragement that instructs you as sons:
\q "My son, do not lightly regard the discipline of the Lord,
\q nor lose heart when you are corrected by him."
\q
\v 6 For  the Lord disciplines anyone whom he loves,
\q and he punishes every son whom he receives.
