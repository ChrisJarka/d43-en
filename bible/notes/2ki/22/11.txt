\v 11 So when the king had heard the words of the book of the Law, he tore his clothes.
\v 12 The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the kingâ€™s servant, saying,
\v 13 "Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people and for all Judah concerning the words of this book that is found, for great is the anger of Yahweh that is kindled against us because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us."
