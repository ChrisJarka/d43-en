===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus showing his glory to three of his disciples.
After the vision of Christ in his glory, the disciples asked, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" 

  * **Elijah will indeed come and restore all things** - Jesus assures the disciples that what God promised will happen.
  * **they did not recognize him** - "the leaders of the Jewish people did not recognize John the Baptist"
  * **at their hands** - "at the hands of the leaders of the Jewish people"
  * **hands** - what the leaders will do to Jesus (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
