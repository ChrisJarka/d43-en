===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in 5:1.

  * **But when you give alms **- The word "you" refers to the crowd that Jesus is talking to.
  * **do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing**  - This does not refer to your physical left or right hand but rather doing actions in secret. Just like our left hand does not need to agree with our right hand, our actions do not need to be seen by other people. (see: metaphor)
  * **your alms may be given in private**  - This phrase is saying give to the poor without other people knowing.
