\v 7 For every one from the house of Israel and from the sojourners who sojourn in Israel who deserts me, and takes his idols 
into his heart and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, then comes to the prophet to seek me; I, Yahweh 
will answer him myself!
\v 8 So I will set my face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, for I will cut him off from the midst of my people; 
and you will know that I am Yahweh!'
