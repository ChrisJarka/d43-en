\v 30 Therefore prophesy you against them all these words, and say to them, Jehovah will roar from on high, and utter his
voice from his holy habitation; he will mightily roar against his fold; he will give a shout, as they that tread
the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
\v 31 A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for Jehovah has a controversy with the nations; he will enter into
judgment with all flesh: as for the wicked, he will give them to the sword, says Jehovah.
