\p
\v 1 The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the
kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the
cities thereof, saying:
\v 2 Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus says Jehovah, Behold,
I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:
\v 3 and you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and your eyes shall
behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.
