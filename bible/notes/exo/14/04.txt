===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to instruct Moses on where to go and what Yahweh will do.

  * **I** - The pronoun "I" in 14:4 refers to Yahweh. 
  * **harden Pharaoh's heart** - See how you translated "harden" in [[en:bible:notes:exo:07:11|]]. The word "heart" here represents the will or choices a person makes. AT: "harden Pharaoh's will." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will get honor** - "People will honor me"
  * **The Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh** - "The Egyptians will understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God."
  * **had fled** - "had run away"
  * **What have we done in letting Israel go free from working for us?** - They asked this question to show they thought they did a foolish thing. AT: "We have done a stupid thing by letting Israel go free from working for us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
