\c 19
\p
\v 1 And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them, You shall be holy; for I Jehovah your God am
holy.
\v 3 You shall fear every man his mother, and his father; and you shall keep my sabbaths: I am Jehovah your God.
\v 4 Turn you not to idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am Jehovah your God.
\p
\v 5 And when you offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah, you shall offer it that you may be accepted.
\v 6 It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the morrow: and if anything remain until the third day, it shall be burnt
with fire.
\v 7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted:
\v 8 but every one that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy thing of Jehovah: and that soul
shall be cut off from his people.
\p
\v 9 And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather
the gleaning of your harvest.
\v 10 And you shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; you shall leave them
for the poor and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God.
\p
\v 11 You shall not steal; neither shall you deal falsely, nor lie one to another.
\v 12 And you shall not swear by my name falsely, and profane the name of your God: I am Jehovah.
\p
\v 13 You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him: the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with you all night until
the morning.
\v 14 You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind; but you shall fear your God: I am Jehovah.
\p
\v 15 You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: you shall not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the
mighty; but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor.
\v 16 You shall not go up and down as a talebearer among your people: neither shall you stand against the blood of your
neighbor: I am Jehovah.
\p
\v 17 You shall not hate your brother in your heart: you shall surely rebuke your neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.
\v 18 You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people; but you shall love your neighbor
as thyself: I am Jehovah.
\p
\v 19 You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle gender with a diverse kind: you shall not sow your field with
two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon you a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.
\v 20 And whoever lies carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor
freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
\v 21 And he shall bring his trespass-offering to Jehovah, to the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a
trespass-offering.
\v 22 And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before Jehovah for his sin which he
has sinned: and the sin which he has sinned shall be forgiven him.
\p
\v 23 And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit
thereof as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised to you; it shall not be eaten.
\v 24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise to Jehovah.
\v 25 And in the fifth youar shall you eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield to you the increase thereof: I am Jehovah
your God.
\p
\v 26 You shall not eat anything with the blood: neither shall you use enchantments, nor practise augury.
\v 27 You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard.
\v 28 You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am Jehovah.
\p
\v 29 Profane not your daughter, to make her a harlot; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.
\v 30 You shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am Jehovah.
\p
\v 31 Turn you not to them that have familiar spirits, nor to the wizards; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am
Jehovah your God.
\p
\v 32 You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and you shall fear your God: I am Jehovah.
\p
\v 33 And if a stranger sojourn with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong.
\v 34 The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be to you as the home-born among you, and you shall love him as thyself;
for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
\p
\v 35 You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity.
\v 36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall you have: I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of
the land of Egypt.
\v 37 And you shall observe all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them: I am Jehovah.
