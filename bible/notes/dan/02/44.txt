\v 44 But while those kings are ruling, God who rules in heaven will establish a kingdom that will never end. No one will ever defeat its king. He will completely destroy all those kingdoms, but his kingdom will remain forever.
\v 45 That is the meaning of the rock that something cut from the mountain, the rock that will crush to tiny bits the statue that is made of iron, bronze, silver, and gold."

\v 44 And in the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall it be left to another people. It will break in pieces and put an end to all these kingdoms and it will stand forever.
\v 45 Just as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain, but not by human hands, and it broke the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold into pieces. The great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy."
