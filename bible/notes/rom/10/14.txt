\v 14 Most of the Jews have certainly not believed in Christ, and some people might try to explain why they have not done so. They might say, “The Jews certainly cannot ask Christ to help them if they have not first believed in him! And they certainly cannot believe in him if they have not heard about him! And they certainly cannot hear about him if someone does not preach to them about him!
\v 15 And those who could preach to them about Christ, certainly cannot do so if God does not send them. But if some believers preached to them, it would be just like the Scriptures say: ‘It is wonderful when people come and bring good news!'"

\v 15 And how can they preach, unless they are sent?—As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim glad tidings of good things!"
