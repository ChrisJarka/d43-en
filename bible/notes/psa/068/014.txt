\q
\v 14 When the Almighty scattered kings therein,
\q It was as when it snoweth in Zalmon.

\v 15 A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan;
\q A high mountain is the mountain of Bashan.

\v 16 Why look you askance, you high mountains,
\q At the mountain which God has desired for his abode?
\q Yea, Jehovah will dwell in it for ever.
