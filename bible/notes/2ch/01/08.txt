\v 8 And Solomon said to God, You have showed great lovingkindness to David my father, and have made me king in his stead.
\v 9 Now, O Jehovah God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the
dust of the earth in multitude.
\v 10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this your people,
that is so great?
\v 11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of
them that hate thee, neither yet have asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that you may judge
my people, over whom I have made you king:
