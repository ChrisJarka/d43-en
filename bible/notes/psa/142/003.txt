\q
\v 3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,
\q You knew my path.
\q In the way wherein I walk
\q Have they hidden a snare for me.
\q
\v 4 Look on my right hand, and see;
\q For there is no man that knows me:
\q Refuge has failed me;
\q No man careth for my soul.
\q
\v 5 I cried to thee, O Jehovah;
\q I said, You are my refuge,
\q My portion in the land of the living.
</usfm>
