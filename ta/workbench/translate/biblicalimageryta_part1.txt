As in languages everywhere, most **metaphors** in Biblical Hebrew and Greek fall into broad patterns that are often unique to these languages. It is very useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere.

After becoming familiar with these patterns, translators will see that many biblical **similes** are also built on these same conceptual associations. For this reason, it is often instructive to consider similes together with metaphors analysis. In this light, metaphors and similes should be viewed as different strategies for effecting many of the same conceptual associations, but for different purposes related to discourse and audience-reader dynamics.

These patterns of associating Concept A with Concept B present three challenges to anyone who wants to identify them:

(1) The surface manifestations of most Biblical metaphors usually obscure their underlying structures. For example, it may not be immediately obvious that the expression //It is God who puts strength on me like a belt// Ps. 18:32 (ULB) is authorized by the pattern CLOTHING IS MORAL QUALITY (see no. 4 below).

(2) As with all language, the context, i.e., the surrounding text or “co-text,” must determine the sense of an expression. Thus, for example, whether “lamp” refers concretely to a container with oil and a wick for giving light, or whether it refers instead to the notion of life (see LAMP OR FIRE IS LIFE below), depends on the context.

(3) Expressions that are authorized by these conceptual associations frequently combine together in complex ways. Moreover, they frequently combine with—and in some cases are based on—common metonymies (see Part Two below) and cultural models (see Part Three below).

What follows is a list of some of the frequent underlying structural metaphors in the Old Testament, together with examples of their actual textual manifestations. They are organized by semantic domain of the images:
