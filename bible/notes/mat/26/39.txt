\v 39 And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass
away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as you wilt.
\v 40 And he comes to the disciples, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, What, could you not watch with me one
hour?
\v 41 Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
