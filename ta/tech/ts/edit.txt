===== Create Translation Text =====

The first time you use translationStudio, the app will prompt you to set your languages and then return you to the **Edit Screen**. Tap on the **Edit Screen** to begin working. Note that after the first use of translationStudio, the app will open at the **Edit Screen**.

To create a new chapter for your language, navigate to the desired chapter and tap on the **Edit Screen**. The keyboard should open and you can begin working. Your work will be saved automatically every five seconds.

When you are finished working, you can navigate to a different chapter or exit the app.

===== Edit Translation Text =====

When you use translationStudio, you have the ability to create and change text on any page. So to edit existing work that you or another translator created, just navigate to the chapter and tap on the translation side of the page. Your work will be saved automatically every five seconds.

When you are finished working, you can navigate to a different chapter or exit the app.

===== Delete Translation Text =====

If there is a situation where you feel that a large amount of work must be deleted, such as an entire chapter, please contact your superior. Do not remove large amounts of text without discussing it first, even if you feel that a mistranslated key word has caused a significant problem. Your superior may know of another way to handle the issue without deleting previous work.

If you accidentally delete a large amount of work, contact your superior.
