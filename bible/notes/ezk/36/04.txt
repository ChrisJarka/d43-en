\v 4-6 Therefore, you mountains of Israel, listen to this message from me. I, Yahweh the Lord, have something to say to you, the hills and mountains, and to you, the ravines and valleys, and to you, the towns and cities which the enemy burned down, where no one is living any longer, from where the enemy has taken everything valuable, and whose people the people-groups all around are mocking. "This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare: I am very angry with the people of Edom and the other people-groups; they have insulted your Israelite people and taken all their land. So Ezekiel must speak for me to you, the land of Israel, mountains and hills, valleys and ravines: I, Yahweh the Lord, am very angry because the enemy has insulted you.

\v 4 Therefore, mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord Yahweh: Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and the high hills, to the streambeds and valleys, to the uninhabited desolations and the forsaken cities that have become plunder and a subject of mocking for to the other nations that surround them—
\v 5 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: I have certainly spoken in the fire of my fury against the other nations, against Edom and all who took my land for themselves as a possession, against all those who had joy in their heart and disdain in their spirit, as they seized my land for the sake of its pasture.
\v 6 Therefore, prophesy to the land of Israel and say to the mountains and to the high hills, to the streambeds and to the valleys, thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold! In my fury and in my anger I am declaring this because you have born the insults of nations.
