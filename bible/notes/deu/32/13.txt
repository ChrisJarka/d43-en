===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **He made him ride on the heights of the land** - This is an idiom. The word "him" refers to the people of Israel. AT: "Yahweh made them ride on the high places of the land" or "Yahweh helped them take and occupy the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **he fed him the fruits of the field** - This means that Yahweh brought them to a land with plenty of produce they could 
  * **he nourished him with honey from the rock, and oil from the flinty crag** - "He provided honey for them from the rock, and oil from the rocky ground." The land had many wild bees, which produce honey, with hives inside rock holes. There were also many olive trees, which provide oil, and grow on rocks, hills and mountains.
