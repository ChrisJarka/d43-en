\v 1 Oh come, let us sing to Jehovah;
\q Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
\q
\v 2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving;
\q Let us make a joyful noise to him with psalms.
\q
\v 3 For Jehovah is a great God,
\q And a great King above all gods.
\q
\v 4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth;
\q The heights of the mountains are his also.
\q
\v 5 The sea is his, and he made it;
\q And his hands formed the dry land.
\q
\v 6 Oh come, let us worship and bow down;
\q Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker:
\q
\v 7 For he is our God,
\q And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.
\q To-day, oh that you would hear his voice!
\q
\v 8 Harden not your heart, as at Meribah,
\q As in the day of Massah in the wilderness;
\q
\v 9 When your fathers tempted me,
\q Proved me, and saw my work.
\q
\v 10 Forty years long was I grieved with that generation,
\q And said, It is a people that do err in their heart,
\q And they have not known my ways:
\q
\v 11 Wherefore I sware in my wrath,
\q That they should not enter into my rest.
