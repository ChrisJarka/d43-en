===== Put Your Work Online =====

When you are done with your translation, and even before you are done, we encourage you to put your work online at door43.org. If you have done your work on Door43, your work is already there! If you are working in translationStudio, there is an upload button that allows you to upload your work directly onto Door43.

By uploading your work while the translation is in progress it allows others to see your work, become excited in it, participate in the translation and checking process, and benefit from hearing God's Word in their own language! Another added benefit of uploading a completed language which has been checked to at least a Level 1 is that the content is published on the unfoldingWord website which in turn populates the unfoldingWord mobile app. This greatly enhances the ease of distribution. In addition, the text will be rendered as a print-ready PDF which will allow for printing of hard-copy books as well.
