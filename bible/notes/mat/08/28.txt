\v 28 When they came to the east side of the lake, they arrived in the region where the Gadarenes lived. Jesus got out of the boat and began walking on the road. Then two men who were controlled by demons came out of the burial caves where they were living. Because they were extremely violent and attacked people, no one dared to travel on the road near where they were living.
\v 29 Suddenly they shouted to Jesus, "You are the Son of God! Because you have nothing in common with us, leave us alone! Have you come here to torture us before the time God has appointed to punish us?"

forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by that way.
\v 29 And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, you Son of God? are you come hither to torment us
before the time?
