\v 33 But King Jeroboam still did not turn away from continuing to do the evil things that he was doing. Instead, he appointed more priests from men \add who were not descended from Levi\add*. Anyone who wanted to be a priest, he appointed to be a priest, in order that he could offer sacrifices on the hills.
\v 34 Because he committed that sin, \add a few years later\add* God got rid of most of Jeroboam's descendants and did not allow them to become kings of Israel.

\v 33 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high
places: whoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.
\v 34 And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the
earth.
