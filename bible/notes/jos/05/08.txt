===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 After all the Israelite males had been circumcised, they remained in the camp and rested until their wounds were healed.
\v 9 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, "Because your forefathers were wandering without divine help in the desert for forty years \f + \ft Or: \add Because your forefathers were slaves in Egypt\add* \f*, the Egyptians felt disgusted toward you. But today I have taken away the reproach the Egyptians have had toward you." Because of that, the people called the place 'Gilgal,' \add which sounds like the Hebrew word 'taken away,'\add* and it still has that name.

\v 8 After all the Israelite males had been circumcised, they remained in the camp and rested until they healed.
\v 9 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you." So, the name of the place was called 'Gilgal,' which sounds like the word for 'wheel of the cart,' and it reminds them the Yahwah rolled away their disgrace.
