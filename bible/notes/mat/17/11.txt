  * **Elijah will indeed come and restore all things**  - Jesus assures the disciples that what God promised will happen.
  * **they did not recognize him **- Here "they" refers to the leaders of the Jewish people who did not recognize John the Baptist as the one who was announcing the coming of the Messiah. Here "him" refers to John the Baptist who came as Elijah.
  * **at their hands **- "their" refers to the leaders of the Jewish people.
  * **hands**  - what the leaders will do to Jesus (See: Metonymy)
