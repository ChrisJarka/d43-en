====== Colossians 02:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Make sure that no one forces you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* to become his disciples \f + \ft metaphor \f* by his teaching you a religious philosophy\f + \ft Or: doctrine \f* that is valueless and false. Such a philosophy is false because it teaches what mere human beings think, because it teaches people elementary regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* \add that are concerned merely with what is external\f + \ft Or: physical \f*\add*, and because it teaches what is contrary to \add the true teaching about\add* Christ.
\v 9 \add Make sure of this\add*, because it is in Christ's body that God lives completely.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Do not believe anyone who says that you must obey what people have taught about how to honor God or that you must obey what they worship in this world. Instead, obey Christ,
\v 9 because the man Jesus Christ is fully God.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

\v 8 See that no one captures you through the philosophy and the empty deceit according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.
\v 9 For in him lives all the fullness of God bodily.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Paul urges the believers to be careful not to turn to the words and rules of others because nothing can add to the fullness of God which believers have in Christ.

  * **See that** - "Be cautious that" or "Watch out that"
  * **captures you** - This metaphor compares the way a person can be physically caught and held by force to how a person can be emotionally and spiritually caught and captured by false teachings. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **captures you** - "captures you, Colossian believers"
  * **philosophy** - the religious doctrines and beliefs that are not from God's word but are based on man's thoughts about God and life
  * **empty deceit** - This refers to misleading ideas that do not lead to life in Christ. They produce nothing; they are "empty," without value. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the tradition of men...the elements of the world** - Both Jewish traditions and pagan (Gentile) belief systems are worthless. "The elements of the world" perhaps refers to evil spirits that claimed to rule the world and that were adored by people. But some interpreters view "the elements of the world" as meaning basic teachings about the world.
  * **For in him lives all the fullness of God bodily** - "For in Christ is the full being of God"
