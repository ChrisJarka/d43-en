\v 20 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said to
them, Thus says God, Why transgress you the commandments of Jehovah, so that you cannot prosper? because you have forsaken
Jehovah, he has also forsaken you.
\v 21 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of
Jehovah.
\v 22 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son. And when he
