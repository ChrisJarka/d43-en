<usfm>
\v 11 Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: An adversary there shall
be, even round about the land; and he shall bring down your strength from thee, and your palaces shall be plundered.
\v 12 Thus says Jehovah: As the shepherd rescueth out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the
children of Israel be rescued that sit in Samaria in the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed.
