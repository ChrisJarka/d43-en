\v 1 \add Now another matter:\add* When any of you\add believers\add* accuses another believer about some matter, he takes that matter to judges who are not believers, \add for them to decide the case\add*, instead of asking God's people \add to decide it\add*. That is disgusting!\f + \ft Or: Why do you do that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 2 \add I want\add* you to know that \add we who are\add* God's people will \add some day\add* judge those who are unbelievers.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that \add we who are\add* God's people will \add some day\add* judge those who are unbelievers? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So, since you will be judging unbelievers, you certainly are capable of judging between \add believers who disagree on\add* small matters!\f + \ft Or: are you not you capable of judging between \add believers who disagree on\add* small matters? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 3 You should keep in mind that we will even judge angels!\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that we will even judge angels? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So we certainly should be able to judge about \add matters that relate to how we\add* conduct our lives here on earth!

\v 1 When you have a dispute with another Christian, you should not take that matter before a civil judge who is not a Christian. You should resolve the issue before one who is living a holy life as a Christian, a saint, he will be able to judge the matter.
\v 2 You should know that the saints will judge the world. If you will be judging the world one day, you have the ability to find a fair resolution on matters that are far less important than the judgment of the world?
\v 3 You should know that you will judge angels! How much more are you able to judge between issues in this life?

\c 6
\p
\v 1 When one of you has a dispute with another, does he dare to go to the civil court before an unbelieving judge, rather than before the saints?
\v 2 Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you will judge the world you are certainly competent to settle matters that could be handled in a simple way?
\v 3 Do you not know that we will judge the angels? How much more, then, can we make judgments in matters of this life?
