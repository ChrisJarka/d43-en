<usfm>
\v 30 I will not \add be able to\add* talk to you much longer, because what happens to me will be as though \add Satan\add*, the ruler of this world, is coming\add to attack me\add*. But he has no \add control over what happens to\add* me.
\v 31 Instead, the people who do not belong to God \f + \ft metonymy \f* must learn \add from what happens to me\add* that I love \add my\add* Father, and I am doing the things that he has commanded me to do. Now, let's get up and leave here."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I will not be able to talk with you much longer, because the ruler of this world is coming. But he has no power over me,
\v 31 and I will do what the Father has commanded me. This is so the world will know that I love the Father. Come, let's go from here."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 30 I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he has nothing in me;
\v 31 but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go
hence.
</usfm>
