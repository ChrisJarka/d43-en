====== oath, swear ======

===== Definition: =====

An oath is a formal promise to do something or to tell the truth. To swear is to say that what is being said is true.

  * A modern use of swear is to invoke Heaven as a witness to the truth of a statement. The New Testament forbids this use.
  * When Peter denied knowing Jesus, he swore that he did not know him. This means that he stated this strongly to convince people he was telling the truth (even though he was not).
