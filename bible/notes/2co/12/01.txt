\v 1 \add It seems that\add* it is necessary for me to go on boasting \add about myself\add*. Although \add I do\add* not \add think that my telling you about\add* this will help \add you to accept me as Christ's representative to you\add*, I \add will say this anyway\add*. I will tell you about visions that the Lord \add gave a certain man\add* and about things that he \add supernaturally\add* revealed \add to that man. I will tell you this because some of the people among you boast that it was in visions that they received the things that they teach\add*.
\v 2 The man that I will tell you about is one \add who believes\add* in Christ. Fourteen years ago he was taken \f + \ft Or:\add Christ\add* took him \f* up into the highest heaven, \add the place where God is\add*. I do not know whether he went there \add in his physical body\add* or whether he was outside of his body \add at that time and only his spirit went\add*. Only God really knows.

\v 1 I want to defend myself by telling you about my qualifications, even through nothing can be gained by my boasting. I would rather tell you about the day about the Lord showed me part of heaven and I will tell you some of what he taught me when I was there.
\v 2 I know a man who is "in Christ,"—I am not sure if this happened physically, taking my body to heaven, or purely in a vision of what is in heaven that was just as real. I do not know which is true, but God knows—who was taken up into the highest part of heaven.

\v 1 I must boast, but nothing is gained by it. But I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.
\v 2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—-was caught up into the third heaven.
