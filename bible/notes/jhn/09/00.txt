====== John 09 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Who sinned?" ==
In ancient Israel, it was commonly believed that a child was born with disabilities because of the sin of one of his parents. This was not the teaching of the Law of Moses. In this exchange, the Pharisees were sinners because they saw the power of Jesus and did not worship him. 

== "I am..." ==

John uses this phrase seven times in his gospel. It is the same words used by God, when he revealed himself and his name at the burning bush. The name “Yahweh” can be translated as “I am.”

== Light ==
Light is a common image in Scripture used to represent [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]]. Light is also used to show the path of righteousness and to show righteous living. Darkness and night are often used as images to representing [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] or [[:en:obe:kt:unrighteous|unrighteousness]].

== "He does not keep the Sabbath" ==
The Pharisees considered Jesus making the mud his saliva to be "work" and in violation of the laws regarding the Sabbath.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Sight ==
This chapter records the events of a man who was born without sight. Jesus also uses these events as a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]. In [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:09:39|9:39-40]], the Pharisees are called blind because the are unable to see the truth in front of them.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "Son of Man" ==

Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this passage. It may not be possible in every language to have someone speaking in the first person, also speak in the third person.
