\v 1 The word of Yahweh came to me and said, 
\v 2 “Son of man, there were two women, daughter of the same mother,
\v 3 and they whored about in Egypt, in the time of their youth they whored about there. Their breasts were squeezed and the nipples of their 
virginity were fondled there.
\v 4 Their names were Oholah—the older sister—and Oholibah—her sister. Then they became mine and bore sons and daughters. And their 
names: Samaria is Oholah and Jersusalem is Oholibah.
