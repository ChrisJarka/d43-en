====== Writing Styles ======

Also known as 'Discourse.' Every story has a storyline. The storyline tells a series of events in chronological order and has a beginning, middle and end. It is full of types of words or phrases that moves the reader along the storyline.

For Example:

  * **Background Information**  - Occasionally an author may take a break from the storyline to share something of interest. This break usually contains background information.(See: [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:writingstyles_background|Writing Styles - Background Information]]) An author may use background information for several reasons: 1) to add interest to the story, 2) to provide important historical or cultural information or 3) to tell the reader, or listener, something very important.
  * **Therefore**  - The word 'therefore' is used to mark the conclusion or reason for a discussion. (See: [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:writingstyles_therefore|Writing Styles - Therefore]])
  * **Now**  - The word "now" at the beginning of the sentence …. (See: [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:writingstyles_now|Writing Styles - Now]])

Discourse features

The term “discourse” refers to how the parts of a text are organized and connected in order to clearly and naturally communicate the correct meaning of a text. In every translation, the way that words, sentences, and paragraphs are arranged will affect how the message will be understood.

General discourse types:
•	narrative (tells a story or event)
•	explanatory (explains facts or teaches principles)
•	procedural (tells how to do something)
•	argumentative (tries to persuade someone to do something

The purpose of a particular text will influence what kinds of discourse features are used. For example, in a narrative, discourse concerns would include:  conversation and the use of quotes; how to introduce new events and characters into the story; how to refer to the participants, with either a noun or a pronoun. Languages have organized ways of communicating information in each of these discourse types.

[perhaps give examples for each of the types –  probably areother types]


Discourse groupings:

1) Grammatical groupings: This deals with how language units such as setences and paragraphs are linked together to from larger units. Transition words and phrases that connect smaller units to form larger units are one type of discourse feature. Some common grammatical units are phrase, sentence, paragraph, and episode.
 2) Plot-related groupings: This includes how the story begins, how it transitions from one event to the next and how it communicates the climax or ending of the story.:

A.  Specific discourse issues:      [each topic on a separate page?]

1.  Introduction of a new event or participant into the narrative.

Phrases like “One day” or “It came about that” or “This is how it happened” or “Sometime after that” signal to the reader that a new event is about to be related.

To introduce a new participant into the story, the text might say, “There once was a man who....” or “A certain man was traveling...” Every language has specific ways to communicate these introductions.

Examples from the Bible:

1 Samuel 1:1  Now there was a certain man from the city of Ramathaim-zophim in the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah.
2 Samuel 2:20 And there happened to be there  a base fellow....

Esther 2:6 There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai.


2.  Quotations

How quotations are introduced:
ex. “He answered and said” or “This is what the Lord God says”

Use of direct or indirect quotes:

direct:  Jesus said to the wind and waves, “Be still!”
indirect:  Jesus commanded the wind and waves to be still.

All languages have specific patterns that are natural for reporting what someone said. Some languages might allow both direct and indirect quotes, depending on the context. Others might only allow the use of  direct quotes or only allow the use of indirect quotes.

Example:

3. Pronoun reference system:

Languages have a certain pattern of how frequently to  use pronouns. If that pattern is not followed, wrong meaning can result.

For example,  in Mark 2:13-15,  the Greek text uses pronouns in this way:

“And he went out again by the sea side...And as he passed by, he saw Levi...and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him. And it happened that he sat down to eat in his house and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples....”

English has a different pattern of using pronouns and nouns so the above text is very unnatural. It is confusing and requires a bit of figuring out in order to understand what it means. The following uses the English pronoun reference system more naturally:

“And Jesus went out again...and as he passed by he saw Levi....and said to him, “Follow me.” So Levi got up and followed him. And when Jesus was eating at Levi's house, many tax collectors...were also there eating with Jesus and his disciples.”

In English, the proper name is used first in a text and then the pronouns follow. If it is unclear who is being referred to, the noun is repeated. It is important to find out what patterns a language uses to prevent confusion of characters.

4.  Background information :

In the above example, the event at Levi's house begins,

“And when Jesus was eating...”
This leaves out the background information that Jesus went to Levi's house to eat. In some languages it is necessary to give this information first:

“Then Jesus went to eat at Levi's house. While he and his disciples were eating there...”

Another issue is in regard to how to communicate the fact that the disciples were also there. Many languages would prefer to make this clear at the beginning:

“Then Jesus and his disciples went to eat at Levi's house. While they were there, tax collectors and other sinners were also there eating.”

5. How connecting words are used:

Every language has certain patterns for how connecting words (such as “and, ”“but.” or “then”) are used. The text above from the gospel of Mark shows the normal Greek pattern of using “and” very frequently. Often in English and other languages, it is much more natural to either not use a connecting word (conjunction), or to use a different one. For example, it is more natural in English to say “Then” or “After that” rather than “And” when showing a sequence of events. It is also more natural in English to say “So” instead of “And” when what follows communicates a result.

Ex:   Mark 2:13-15

Greek pattern of connecting:  “And he went out again by the sea side and a large crowd of people came out to hear him and he taught them. And as he passed by, he saw Levi...and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him. And it happened that he sat down to eat in his house and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples....”

English pattern of connecting:  “Sometime later, Jesus went out again by the sea. A large crowd of people came out to hear him there and he taught them. As he was walking along, he saw Levi...and he said to him, “Follow me.” So Levi got up and followed him. Jesus and his disciples went to Levi's house to eat and many tax collectors and sinners were also there eating with them....”

Using the language's own patterns of connecting makes the text more clear and natural. Some languages might use connecting words less frequently in this text, while other languages might use connecting words more frequently.

6. Relative prominence or emphasis:

Languages have different ways of showing which parts of a sentence, paragraph, or story are being emphasized the most. This is called “prominence” which refers to how the language shows what is important or what is being emphasized.

For example, one reason for the Greek text not introducing Jesus and his disciples in that paragraph until later may be that putting it in the later position was a way of showing the importance of them being there eating with the sinners. If it is necessary to introduce Jesus and his disciples earlier in the paragraph (as was done above) then a different way of showing prominence could be used. Or it could be that this nuance of prominence may not be able to be translated in this text.

Ways of showing prominence can include:
unusual position of a word or phrase in the sentence
use of an explicit pronoun instead of it just being part of the verb
use of a special affix on a word
