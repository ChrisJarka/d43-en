===== Waveform Editor =====

//This page answers the question:// //What is the waveform editor?//

The Waveform Editor is the main screen or window where the waveform pattern of the sound wave is displayed. A good waveform editor provides a large viewing area with accurate scales to measure amplitude and time. It also will have a convenient way to zoom in to view the waveform in detail and make precise editing decisions. Currently excellent free options are available for both WINDOWS and ANDROID OS.
