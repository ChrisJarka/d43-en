<usfm>
\q
\v 14 Behold, he suffers with iniquity;
\q Yea, he has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
\q
\v 15 He has made a pit, and digged it,
\q And is fallen into the ditch which he made.
\q
\v 16 His mischief shall return upon his own head,
\q And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.

 
\q
\v 17 I will give thanks to Jehovah according to his righteousness,
\q And will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.
