===== Language Community Evaluation Questions =====

This module answers the question: How can I show that the community approves the translation?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:checking:language_community_check|Language Community Check]]

After you have completed the steps for Community Checking under Level Two for the Open Bible Stories or for a book of the Bible, answer the following questions. The answers to these questions will help those in the wider Christian community know that the target language community finds the translation to be clear, accurate, and natural. 

  * Have you tested the translation by reading it to your community members and asking for feedback?
  * Were you able to use this information to make the translation clearer and easier to understand?
  * List a few passages where the community feedback was helpful. How did you change these passages to make them clearer?
  * Write an explanation for some of the Important Terms, explaining how they are equal to terms used in the source language. This will help the checkers understand why you chose these terms.
  * Does the community verify that there is a good flow to the language when the passages are read out loud? (Does the language sound like the writer was a person from your own community?)

The community leaders might want to add their own information to this or make a summary statement about how acceptable this translation is to the local community. This can be included as part of the Level Two Community Check Evaluation information. The wider church leadership will have access to this information, and it will help them validate the translation as approved by the wider Christian community when they do Level Three Checking.
