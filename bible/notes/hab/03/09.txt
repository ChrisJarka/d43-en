  * **The mountains saw you and twisted in pain** - The effects that Yahweh's presence has on the mountains is spoken of as if the mountains were people who writhe in pain. This may refer either the the mountains shaking from an earthquake or to the water from the storm eroding the sides of the mountains as the streams flow down. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
