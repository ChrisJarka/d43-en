\v 17 And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray thee, let there be given to your servant two mulesâ€™ burden of earth; for your servant
will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Jehovah.
\v 18 In this thing Jehovah pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth
on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon your servant in
this thing.
\v 19 And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
