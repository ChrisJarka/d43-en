====== Trance ======

**<font 20px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Definition:</font> **

A state of revelation, such that the person experiencing the trance is able to see a supernatural vision from God. Luke is clear in the book of Acts that Peter's trance is a vehicle of revelation induced by Almighty God to convey a message. Both Peter and Paul were in prayer when they experienced supernatural visions from God. This was clearly intended to imply that this was an act of God.
