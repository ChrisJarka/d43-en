\v 20 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas you have prayed to
me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard thee.
\v 21 This is the word that Jehovah has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you
to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee.
\v 22 Whom have you defied and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high?
even against the Holy One of Israel.
