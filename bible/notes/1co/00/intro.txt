=== What is the Book of 1 Corinthians about? ===

1 Corinthians is a book about conflict. The Corinthian church was divided into factions. Some aligned with Paul, and some were against him. There was false teaching and conflicting messages about spiritual gifts, and what those gifts signified. There were questions about how important those gifts were to be in the worship of the church.
 
The Corinthians were dealing with many issues:  the resurrection of Christ and the resurrection of Christians after they died. The church was wrestling with questions about the Law of God. There were issues of the roles of men and women in the church. Questions about the limits and use of Christian liberty were addressed. Spiritual gifts were defined and their use described and limited. Paul showed the importance of prophecy over tongues (14:1-25). The church needed to be taught about spiritual gifts, but especially about love (Chapter 13). There is a strong condemnation of pride and the reminder of the "most excellent" way of Christian love (12:31-13:13).


=== Who wrote the book of 1 Corinthians? ===

1 Corinthians was written by the Apostle Paul. He had stayed on in Corinth for some time (Acts 18:12-18) and then went to Ephesus. It was when Paul was in Ephesus that he wrote this letter in early AD 55. 
 
There were "reports" from "Chloe's people" that were sent to Paul, and he answered those questions in Chapters 1-6. There was another letter the Corinthians wrote to him that contained another set of questions that he responded to in 7:1.
