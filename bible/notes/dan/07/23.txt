\v 23 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and
shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
\v 24 And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be
diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.
