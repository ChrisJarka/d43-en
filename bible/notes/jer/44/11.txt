\v 11 Therefore, this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelites \add say you belong to\add*, say: I am determined to cause all of you to experience disasters and to get rid of everyone in Judah.
\v 12 You people from Judah who have survived were determined to come and live here in Egypt. So I will get rid of all of you here in Egypt. Every one of you will die, including those who are important and those who are not important. Some of you will be killed by your enemies' swords, some will die from famines. You will become people whom others curse, be horrified about, and make fun of.

\v 11 Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut
off all Judah.
\v 12 And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they
shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall
die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an execration,
and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
