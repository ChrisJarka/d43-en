====== seed ======

===== Definition: =====

  * The term "seed" is used used figuratively and euphemistically to refer to the tiny cells inside a man or woman that combine to cause a baby to grow inside the woman.
  * It is also often used to refer to a person's offspring or descendants.
  * The word "seed" can have a plural meaning, referring to more than one descendant.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * It is best to use the literal term for "seed" that is used in the target language for what a farmer plants in his field to grow more of the same kind of plant.
  * For the figurative uses, it may be more clear to use the word "descendant" instead of seed.
  * For a man or woman's seed, consider how the target expresses this in a way that will not offend or embarrass people.  (See   Euphemism)
