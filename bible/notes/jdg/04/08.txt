\v 8 Barak replied, "I will go only if you go with me."
\p
\v 9 She replied, "Okay, I will go with you. But because that is what you have decided to do, Yahweh will enable a woman to defeat Sisera, and the result will be that you will not be honored\f + \ft Or: people will not honor you \f* \add for doing that\add*."

\v 8 Barak replied, "I will go only if you go with me. If you will not go with me, I will not go."
\p
\v 9 She replied, "Indeed I will go with you. But because that is what you have decided to do, Yahweh will enable a woman to defeat Sisera, and the result will be that no one will honor you for doing that." So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh.

\v 8 Barak said to her, "If you go with me, I will go, but if you do not go with me, I will not go."
\v 9 She said, "I will certainly go with you. However, the road on which you are going will not lead to your honor, for Yahweh will make a woman defeat Sisera by her strength." Then Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.
