\v 9 The message \add that Moses taught them was wonderful, but when people heard\add* that message, \add they realized that they were sinners and that God\add* would punish them. But God's message that we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* teach is a\add* much more wonderful message. We teach people that God will erase the record of\f + \ft Or: declare people no longer guilty for \f* \add the sinful things that they have done\add*.
\v 10 \add The truth is that, although the work of teaching the people to obey God's laws\add* was once important, it is not as important now, because \add the work of teaching people that God will forgive them and\add* enable them to live to please him is far more important.
\v 11 Furthermore, \add the message that Moses taught was not a lasting message, just like\add* the brightness on his face was not lasting and soon faded away. But \add when God gives his Spirit to people\add*, the wonderful work that \add God's Spirit does in their lives\add* is much greater \add because\add* it lasts forever.

\v 9 For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, how much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory!
\v 10 For indeed that which was made glorious is no longer glorious in this respect, because of the glory that surpasses it.
\v 11 For if that which came to an end had glory, how much more glory will there be in that which is permanent!
