<usfm>
\v 11 \add So, although\add* we are \add still\add* alive, we always realize that we may be killed \f + \ft Or:that \add people some day\add* may kill us \f* because \add we teach about\add* Jesus. \add God allows us to suffer\add* in order that \add people\add* will see that Jesus is alive and that he is \add strengthening\add* our bodies that are some day going to die.
\v 12 So \add I conclude that although\add* we \add apostles\add* are constantly \add suffering and may soon\add* die, \add the result of that is that all of\add* you \add have now received eternal\add* life.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Those of us who are alive, God is always leading us to face death because we are joined to Jesus, so that when people look at us, they can know that Jesus is alive.
\v 12 So you can see that death is doing its work in us, but that life is working in you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 We who are alive are always being handed over to death for Jesusâ€™ sake, so that the life of Jesus may be shown in our human bodies.
\v 12 For this reason, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.
