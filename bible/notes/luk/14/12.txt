===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus speaks to the Pharisee who had invited him to his home.)
    * **as they may**  - This could also be translated as, "because they may" or "They might."
    * The direct message of this verse is saying, "//Do not//  invite people to your dinner in order that they will invite you to their dinner in return."  The teaching point is that we should not do good things only because of a possible reward for doing them.
