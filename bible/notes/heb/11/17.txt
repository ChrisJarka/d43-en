\v 17 Because Abraham trusted God, he was ready to kill his son Isaac as a sacrifice when God tested him. Abraham, to whom God promised to give a son, was going to sacrifice the very son whom he had given him, the only son whom his own wife had borne!
\v 18 It was about this son that God had said, "It is only from Isaac that I will consider your family to descend."
\v 19 Abraham considered that to fulfill that promise, God could make Isaac live again even if he died after Abraham had sacrificed him! The result was that when Abraham did receive Isaac back after God told him not to harm Isaac, it was as though he received him back even after he died.

\v 17 It was by faith that Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac. It was actually his only son whom he offered up, he who had received the promises.
\v 18 This was his son about whom it had been said, "It is from Isaac that your descendants be designated."
\v 19 Abraham considered that God was able to raise up Isaac from the dead ones, and figuratively speaking, it was from them that he did receive him back.
