An idiom is a word or phrase unique to a language or locality. An idiom has a special meaning distinct to the area in which the idiom was created by the people who first invented it. The meaning of an idiom is often only known to the people who live in the area in which it was created, because the idiom was invented there with a special usage and purpose in that language.

===== Description =====

An idiom is a word or phrase unique to a language or locality. An idiom has a special meaning distinct to the area in which the idiom was coined by the people who first invented it. The meaning of an idiom is often only known to the people who live in the area in which it was created because it was invented there with a special usage and purpose. 

All languages have unique idioms, although some idioms can have similar meanings to idioms of other localities and cultures. However, most idioms in one language or culture will probably need definition and explanation to people of other languages and cultures.

**Definition**: An idiom is a word or group of words that has a special meaning to the people of that language or culture. The meaning is different from what a person would understand from the meanings of the individual words.

**Example**: Jesus says in Luke 12:50 (ULB): 
“But I have a __baptism to be baptized with__, and how I am distressed until it is completed!”
A “baptism to be baptized with” is an idiom here in this particular context for __suffering__. Jesus meant that he would soon suffer greatly. 
A “baptism” is an immersion into something, and Jesus was about to be immersed into the suffering of the cross, and the rejection and mocking and torture that went with the cross.

**Purpose**: An idiom is created in a culture probably somewhat by accident when someone describes something in an unusual way. But, when that unusual way communicates the message powerfully and clearly (when understood), the unusual way of describing something in an idiom can become accepted and widely used. So, the purpose of an idiom is to say something strongly in a word picture that has been created to powerfully and effectively describe the message of the idiom.

**Reason this could be a translation issue**:
Because the meaning of an idiom is unique to a language or particular locality within that language, a translator or native language speaker can very easily misunderstand an idiom from another culture. Without help, a reader will probably not understand most idioms in the Bible. So, translators must know that idioms exist, what they are, and familiarize themselves with many Biblical idioms. Translators must recognize any idiom that appears in the Bible and know how to discover what it means, and does not mean, before translating it.

==== Definition ====

An idiom is a group of words that has a meaning that is different from what one would understand from the meanings of the individual words.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

  * Use the original idiom if it would be clearly understood in your language.
  * Use a different idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.
  * Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>"But I have __a baptism to be baptized with__, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!" -Luke 12:50 (WEB) 

A "baptism to be baptized with" is an idiom for suffering. Jesus meant that he would soon suffer greatly.

>"Moses came near to the camp, and saw the calf and the dancing, and __Moses' nose burned__," -Exo 32:19

"His nose burned" is a Hebrew idiom that means, "He became angry."

>"You are all __sons of__  light, and __sons of__  the day." -1 Thes 5:5a (WEB) 

The phrase “sons of” is a Hebrew idiom used to refer to people who have certain characteristics. Jews used this idiom even when speaking Greek. "Sons of light" refers to people who live according to the truth.

==== Examples from English ====

>"He saw the light."

means "He finally understood."

>"It cost an arm and a leg."

means "It was very expensive."

>"Let's play it by ear."

means "Let's improvise" or "Let's see what happens and make decisions based on that."

>"She had butterflies in her stomach."

means "She was nervous."
