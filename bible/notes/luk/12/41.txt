\v 41 And Peter said, "Lord, do you speak this parable to us, or also to everyone?"
\v 42 And the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his servants, to give them their portion of food at the right time?
\v 43 Blessed is that servant, whom, when his lord comes, he will find so doing.
\v 44 Truly I say to you, that he will set him over all of his property.
