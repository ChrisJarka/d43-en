===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he loves justice** - The abstract noun "justice" can be translated using the phrase "what is just." AT: "he loves doing what is just" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **You have established fairness** - The abstract noun "fairness" is a metonym for the laws that are fair. "The laws you have established are fair" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **worship at his footstool** - Here the word "footstool" likely refers to the ark of the covenant, which the biblical writers often spoke of as if it were Yahweh's footstool upon which he rested his feet as he sat on his throne in heaven above. The translation can make explicit that the people are to worship Yahweh. AT: "worship Yahweh at his footstool" or "worship Yahweh before his throne in the temple" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
