====== USFM Marker Standards in English ======

USFM Editing Features
This is a list of features that translators need to be able to use when editing their translation.

Chapter Markers

Invisible to the user, handled by the app. Each chapter must start with the correct USFM code, \c.

Verse Markers

Drag and drop verse marker bubbles, saved in text as USFM, \v.

Paragraph Markers

Paragraphs in downstream translations will often be different than their source text. We need to support adding a paragraph marker, which is \p in USFM. See the USFM Reference manual for more information on how these should be encoded (http://paratext.org/system/files/usfmReference2_4.pdf)

Indentation

In particular, poetry in many languages needs to be indented to various levels. This is the \q# code in USFM, where # represents a digit.

Blank lines

Again, for poetry stanzas often need to be set off by blank lines. The \b USFM code does this.

List Items

This correlates to li# where # is a digit.

Footnotes

Translators should be able to add footnotes to arbitrary sections of their text.

Section Titles

Translators should be able to add section titles, this is the \s code.

Added Text

Both the \sp and the \add markers need to be supported.
