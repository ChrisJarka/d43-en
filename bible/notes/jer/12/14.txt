\v 14 This is also what Yahweh said to me: "I will punish the evil nearby nations that have been trying to take away the land that I gave to my Israelite people, and I will force them to leave their own land. But I will throw the people of Judah out of their land, also.
\v 15 But later I will act mercifully toward those nations again, and I will bring them back to their own lands again. Each \add clan\add* will come back to its own land.

\v 14 Thus says Yahweh against all my neighbors, the wicked ones who touch the inheritance that I let my people Israel inherit: Behold! I am the one who pulls them up from their land, 
and I will pull up the house of Judah from their midst.
\v 15 Then it will be after I uproot them, I will restore them and have compassion on them, so I will return themâ€”each man to his inheritance and to his land!
