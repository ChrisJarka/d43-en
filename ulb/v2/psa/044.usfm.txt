\c 44
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil.
\q
\v 1 We have heard with our ears, O God,
\q Our fathers have told us,
\q What work you did in their days,
\q In the days of old.
\q
\v 2 You did drive out the nations with your hand;
\q But them you did plant:
\q You did afflict the peoples;
\q But them you did spread abroad.
\q
\v 3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
\q Neither did their own arm save them;
\q But your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance,
\q Because you was favorable to them.
\q
\v 4 You are my King, O God:
\q Command deliverance for Jacob.
\q
\v 5 Through you will we push down our adversaries:
\q Through your name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
\q
\v 6 For I will not trust in my bow,
\q Neither shall my sword save me.
\q
\v 7 But you have saved us from our adversaries,
\q And have put them to shame that hate us.
\q
\v 8 In God have we made our boast all the day long,
\q And we will give thanks to your name for ever. \qs [Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 9 But now you have cast us off, and brought us to dishonor,
\q And go not forth with our hosts.
\q
\v 10 You make us to turn back from the adversary;
\q And they that hate us take spoil for themselves.
\q
\v 11 You have made us like sheep appointed for food,
\q And have scattered us among the nations.
\q
\v 12 You sellest your people for nought,
\q And have not increased your wealth by their price.
\q
\v 13 You make us a reproach to our neighbors,
\q A scoffing and a derision to them that are round about us.
\q
\v 14 You make us a byword among the nations,
\q A shaking of the head among the peoples.
\q
\v 15 All the day long is my dishonor before me,
\q And the shame of my face has covered me,
\q
\v 16 For the voice of him that reproaches and blasphemeth,
\q By reason of the enemy and the avenger.
\q
\v 17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
\q Neither have we dealt falsely in your covenant.
\q
\v 18 Our heart is not turned back,
\q Neither have our steps declined from your way,
\q
\v 19 That you have sore broken us in the place of jackals,
\q And covered us with the shadow of death.
\q
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God,
\q Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;
\q
\v 21 Will not God search this out?
\q For he knows the secrets of the heart.
\q
\v 22 Yea, for your sake are we killed all the day long;
\q We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
\q
\v 23 Awake, why sleep thou, O Lord?
\q Arise, cast us not off for ever.
\q
\v 24 Wherefore hide you your face,
\q And forget our affliction and our oppression?
\q
\v 25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust:
\q Our body clings to the earth.
\q
\v 26 Rise up for our help,
\q And redeem us for your lovingkindnessâ€™ sake.
