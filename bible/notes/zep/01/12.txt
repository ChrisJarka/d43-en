\v 12 So in that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish the men who have settled into their wine who say in their heart, 'Yahweh will not do good or evil!'
\v 13 Their wealth will become plunder, and their houses will be a wasteland! They will build houses but not inhabit them, and plant vineyards but not drink their wine!
