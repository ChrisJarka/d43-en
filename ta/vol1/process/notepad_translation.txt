==== What to translate ====

**For translationNotes:**

Do not remove or change any equal signs ==. 

Do not translate the section between the formatting with 5 equal signs, the initials 'TFT:', then 5 equal signs and the formatting of 5 equal signs, the words 'Important Terms:' followed by 5 equal signs.

Replace every instance of ':en:' with '://your language code//'. Using Espanol as an example: you would replace ':en:' with ':es:' (es is the language code for Espanol.)

Notes are specific to the ULB translation. See the page on 'How to Write Notes' for more information.

Delete '2 squiggle lines before, the word 'DISCUSSION', and the 2 squiggle lines after'.

**For translationWords:**
    
Do not remove or change any equal signs ==. 

The translators only need to translate words outside of square brackets [ ] and squigly brackets { }.

The words 'Definition', 'Translation Suggestions:', and 'Bible References:' appear on all tW pages. Your translation team members should use the same translation of these words on each tW page.

Replace every instance of ':en:' with '://your language code//'. Using Espanol as an example: you would replace ':en:' with ':es:' (es is the language code for Espanol.)

Delete '2 squiggle lines before, the word 'DISCUSSION', and the 2 squiggle lines after'.
