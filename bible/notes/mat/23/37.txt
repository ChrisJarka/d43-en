\v 37 "O people of Jerusalem, you who killed the prophets who lived long ago, and you who killed others whom God sent to you with stones. Many, many times I wanted to gather you together to protect you, like a hen gathers her young chicks under her wings. But you did not want me to do that.
\v 38 So listen to this: Your city will become an uninhabited place.
\v 39 Keep this in mind: You will see me again only when I return, when you say about me, 'God is truly pleased with this man who comes with God's authority.'"

\v 37 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often did I long to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but you did not agree!
\v 38 See, your house is left to you abandoned.
\v 39 For I say to you, You will not see me from now on, until you say, 'Blessed
is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

JesusÂ laments over the people of Jerusalem who had rejected God.

  * **O Jerusalem, Jerusalem **- Jesus speaks as though the people of Jerusalem were there listening to him. "Jerusalem" here represents all of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you!** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **to gather your children, just as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings** - Jesus uses a metaphor which describes how he wants to protect them the way a hen protects her young from harm by covering them with her wings. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **your children** - all of Israel (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **your house is left to you abandoned** - Jesus is telling them that God has left the Temple, which is a representation of all of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the name of the Lord** - the word "name" here means the full authority of the Lord. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
