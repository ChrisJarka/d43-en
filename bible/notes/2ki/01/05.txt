\v 6 They replied, "A man came to meet us and said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you and tell him that Yahweh says, "'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you wish to ask Baalzebub whether you will recover'? Go tell the king that he will not recover from being injured; instead, he will surely die."'"

\v 5 When the messengers returned to Ahaziah, he said to them, "Why have you returned?"
\v 6 They said to him, "A man came to meet us who said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, "Yahweh says this: 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die.'"'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **When the messengers returned to Ahaziah** - AT "So Elijah went to meet the messengers and told that to them, and they returned to the king instead of going to Ekron. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])"
  * **Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?** - This rhetorical question is asked as a rebuke for consulting Baal Zebub. This may be written as a statement. See how you translated a similar question in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:01:03|3:3]]. AT: "You must think there is no God in Israel since you sent men to get advice from Baal Zebub!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die** -  When King Ahaziah was injured, he was placed in a bed. Yahweh said that he will never become well and be able to get out of the bed. Translate this statement the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:01:03|3:4]]. AT: "you will not recover and you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
