<usfm>
\v 14 If someone borrows an animal, and if that animal is hurt or dies when its owner is not there, the one who borrowed it must pay the owner for the animal.
\v 15 But if that happens when the owner of the animal is there, the one who borrowed it will not have to pay back anything. If the man who borrowed it only rented it, the money that he paid to rent it will be enough to pay for the animal \add dying or being injured\add*."

\v 14 If a man borrows any animal from his neighbor and it is injured  or dies, the owner not being with it, he will surely make restitution.
\v 15 But if the owner was with it, he will not have to pay; if it was something hired, it came for its hiring fee.
