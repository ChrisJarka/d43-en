\v 15 Now if you are ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and pipes, and all kinds of music, to  fall down and worship the statue which I have made, all is well. But if you do not worship, you will immediately be thrown into a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who is able  to deliver you out of my hands?"
