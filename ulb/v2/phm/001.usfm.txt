\v 1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,
\v 2 and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in your house:
\v 3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\b
\p
\v 4 I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
\v 5 hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
\v 6 that the fellowship of your faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, to Christ.
\v 7 For I had much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.
\p
\v 8 Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin you that which is befitting,
\v 9 yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:
\v 10 I beseech you for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,
\v 11 who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to me:
\v 12 whom I have sent back to you in his own person, that is, my very heart:
\v 13 whom I would fain have kept with me, that in your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel:
\v 14 but without your mind I would do nothing; that your goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.
\v 15 For perhaps he was therefore parted from you for a season, that you should have him for ever;
\v 16 no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in
the flesh and in the Lord.
\v 17 If then you countest me a partner, receive him as myself.
\v 18 But if he has wronged you at all, or oweth you aught, put that to mine account;
\v 19 I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not to you that you owest to me even your own self
besides.
\v 20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.
\p
\v 21 Having confidence in your obedience I write to thee, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.
\v 22 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.
\p
\v 23 Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;
\v 24 and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.
\p
\v 25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
