\v 13 Now you Ephesians and other non-Jews have heard the true message, the Good News that Jesus saves anyone who believes him. And you have believed in Christ, so God's Spirit has sealed you to show that you now belong to Christ, like a king's seal shows what belongs to him. God promised his Spirit to those set apart for him, and God's Spirit now lives in you.
\v 14 The Holy Spirit who lives in us guarantees us that we will receive all that God has promised, especially when he will free us completely from the power and condemnation of sin, for which we will praise him in his shining light and power.

\v 13 You Gentiles also heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation by Christ, in whom you also have believed and were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit.
\v 14 The Spirit is the guarantee that we will inherit what God has promised, our redemption, because we are purchased as God's own people, to the praise of his glory.
