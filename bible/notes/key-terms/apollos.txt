====== Apollos ======

===== Facts: =====

Apollos was an Alexandrian Jew who was well-educated in the Scriptures and who was an eloquent speaker.

  * Apollos taught about Jesus but only knew about John's baptism so two Christians in Ephesus named Aquila and Priscilla instructed him.
  * His gift in speaking may be what led some Christians in Corinth to proudly say they were "of Apollos".
  * Paul rebuked the Corinthians for their divisive attitude and said that each leader had his part in spreading the message about Christ; he said that Apollos watered the seed of God's word that Paul had planted.
