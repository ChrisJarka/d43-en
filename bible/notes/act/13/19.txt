  * **After he hadâ€¦ **- After God had
  * **seven nations**  - the number seven here is not a tally but a representative figure. In Israelite thought and writings, seven represented completion. The sentence here is not intended to tell you how many nations lived in Israel before the Israelites, but that God drove out the previous inhabitants completely.
