\v 12 Then the king’s scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all Haman commanded, was written to  the king’s provincial governors (over all the provinces),  and to the governors of all the various peoples, and to the officials of all the people, to every province in their own written script, and to every people in their own language. It was written in the  name of King Ahasuerus and was sealed with the king’s ring.
\v 13 Documents were hand-delivered by couriers to all the king's provinces, to annihilate, to kill, and to destroy all Jews, from young to old, children and women, in one day—on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (which is the month of Adar)—and to plunder their valuables.
