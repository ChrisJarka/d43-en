\v 14 Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the kingâ€™s dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
\v 15 that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers: so shall you find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste.
\v 16 We certify the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means you shall have no portion beyond the River.
