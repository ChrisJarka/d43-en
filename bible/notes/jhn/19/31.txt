\v 31 That was the day that they prepared everything for their Sabbath.The next day was a special day of rest, because it was the day of rest during the Passover celebration. The Jewish leaders  did not want the bodies of the three men to remain on the cross during their Sabbath day because leaving bodies hanging overnight would be contrary to their Jewish laws. So they went to Pilate and asked him to command that the legs of the three men on the crosses be broken, so that they would die quickly. Then their bodies could be taken down and buried.
\v 32 So, after Pilate agreed, the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man whom they had nailed on a cross near Jesus. Then they broke the legs of the second man.
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead already. So they did not break his legs.

\v 31 The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the Sabbath (for
the day of that Sabbath was a high day), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and
that they might be taken away.
\v 32 The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:
\v 33 but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
