\v 10 Thus says Jehovah: Yet again there shall be heard in this place, whereof you say, It is waste, without man and without
beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and
without beast,
\v 11 the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them
that say, Give thanks to Jehovah of hosts, for Jehovah is good, for his lovingkindness
endures for ever; and of them that bring sacrifices of
thanksgiving into the house of Jehovah. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, says
Jehovah.
