\c 114
\q
\v 1 When Israel went forth out of Egypt,
\q The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
\q
\v 2 Judah became his sanctuary,
\q Israel his dominion.
\q
\v 3 The sea saw it, and fled;
\q The Jordan was driven back.
\q
\v 4 The mountains skipped like rams,
\q The little hills like lambs.
\q
\v 5 What aileth thee, O you sea, that you fleest?
\q You Jordan, that you turn back?
\q
\v 6 You mountains, that you skip like rams;
\q You little hills, like lambs?
\q
\v 7 Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord,
\q At the presence of the God of Jacob,
\q
\v 8 Who turned the rock into a pool of water,
\q The flint into a fountain of waters.
