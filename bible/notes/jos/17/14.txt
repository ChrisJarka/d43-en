\p
\v 14 And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance,
seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as hitherto Jehovah has blessed me?
\v 15 And Joshua said to them, If you be a great people, get you up to the forest, and cut down for yourself there in the
land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
