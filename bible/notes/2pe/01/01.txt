\v 1 I, Simon Peter, am writing this letter to you. I serve Jesus Christ, and I am an apostle that he appointed. I am sending this letter to you whom God has caused to believe in Christ just like he caused us apostles to believe in Christ. You and we have the same honor of believing in Jesus Christ. He is God, he is completely just, he is the one whom we worship, and he is our Savior.
\v 2 I pray that God will continue to act very kindly towards you and give you a deep peace, because you truly know God and Jesus, who is our Lord.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Peter** - “From Peter.” Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. This could be translated as “I, Peter, wrote this letter.” 
  * **a slave **- "a bond-servant" or "I serve." (UDB) A person who willingly obey God through faithful service to Christ are often called His “bond-servants." This should not be confused with a person who is  captured and forced to become a slave.
  * **slave and apostle of Jesus Christ** - These two terms modify each other. This tells us how Peter sees himself and whose authority that he speaks with. Alternate translation: "a bond-servant messenger of Jesus Christ." (See: [[en:ta:translate:hendiadys]])
  * **to those who have received **- "to other believers" or "the church"  
  * **we have received **- "apostles have received" 
  * **you**  - this refers to the church, those who already believe. 
  * **Jesus our Lord **- Jesus the Lord of the believers and apostles.
