===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Translate this verse as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:07|2:7]].

  * **daughters of Jerusalem** - "young women of Jerusalem." These young women could not hear her and were not present, but the woman speaks as if they were present and could hear her. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **by the gazelles and the does of the fields** - Although the daughters of Jerusalem are not there to hear her, the woman is telling them that the gazelles and the does will punish them they break their promise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **the gazelles** - animals that look like deer and move quickly.
  * **does** - female deer
  * **of the fields** - "that live in the countryside." This refers to land that has not been farmed.
  * **will not awaken or arouse love until she pleases** - One possible meaning is that the abstract noun "love" is spoken of as a person who is asleep, and the daughters of Jerusalem are to allow her to sleep until she wants to awaken. This is a metaphor for the man and woman being ready to make love. Another possible meaning is "will not disturb us until we have finished making love." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **will not awaken or arouse** - If your language has only one word for waking people out of sleep, you could combine these words. AT: "will not awaken" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
