====== flood ======

===== Definition: =====

A flood is a great amount of water that covers over land completely so that the ground cannot be seen.

  * In Noah's time, people had become so evil that God caused a worldwide flood to come over the entire surface of the earth, even covering the mountaintops. All other floods cover a much smaller land area.
  * Ways to translate "flood" could include, "an overflowing of water" or "large amounts of water."
  * For expressions like <font 14px line-height: 11.1999998092651px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>"a flood of water," the word "flood" could be translated as</font> "an overwhelming amount" or "an overflowing.".
  * The term "flood" can also be used figuratively, as in "let not the flood sweep over me" or "they surround me like a flood." If possible, this figurative language should be kept in a translation. For example, "I flood my bed with tears" could be translated as "<font 14px line-height: 11.1999998092651px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>my tears soak my bed with water like a flood."</font>
