===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Here I am; testify against me **  - "Now tell me"(UDB) Samuel is saying that the people should remember and speak out any wrong which they believe he has done to them. His language is very strong because the new king depends on their trust. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes|Litotes]])
  * **Whom have I defrauded? **- "Whom have I cheated?" (UDB) The word defraud means to get something by deceit.
  * **Whose ox… Whose donkey… **- This is a series of quesions about certain bad behaviors, but Samuel is really asking them to think back to see whether they can recall a single time when he has not been totally honest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]])
  * **Testify against me, and I will restore it to you **- "If I have done any of these things, tell me, and I will pay back what I owe." (UDB)
