\v 13 Every vow and every binding oath to deny herself may be established or cancelled by a woman's husband.
\v 14 But if her husband says nothing at all to her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows and all her bonds which are upon her. He has established them because he has said nothing to her during the time that he heard them.
