==== God is one being, and He exists as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit ====

1. **The Bible teaches that there is only one God.**\\ 
>Yahweh, he is God; there is __no other God__! (I Kings 8:60 ULB)

>Jesus said,... This is everlasting life: that they should know you, __the only true God__. (John 17:3 ULB)\\ 
(See also: Deuteronomy 4:35, Ephesians 4:5-6, 1 Timothy 2:5, James 2:19)

2. **The Old Testament begins to reveal God's three Persons.**\\ 
>__God__ created the heavens... __The Spirit of God__ was moving... "Let __us__ make man in __our__ image."  (Genesis 1:1-2 ULB)\\ 

>God has spoken to us by a __Son__... through whom he also made the universe. His __Son__ is the radiance of his glory, the very character of his essence... about the __Son__ he says,... "__In the beginning, Lord, you laid earth's foundation__; the heavens are the work of your hands." (Hebrews 1:2, 3, 8-10 ULB quoting Psalm 102:25)

3. **The Church has always found it impossible to state what the New Testament says about God without affirming that He exists in three distinct Persons: The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.**\\
>Jesus said, "...Baptize them into the name of __the Father__, of __the Son__, and of __the Holy Spirit__." (Matthew 28:19 ULB)\\

>God sent his __Son__, born of a woman,... God sent the __Spirit__ of his Son into our hearts, who calls, "Abba, __Father__." (Galatians 4:4-6 ULB)\\
(See also: John 14:16-17, 1 Peter 1:2)

Each Person of God is fully God. Each Person is called "God" in the Bible.

>Yet for us there is only one __God the Father__ (1 Corinthians 8:6 ULB)

>Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and __my God__.” __Jesus__ said to him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and yet have believed.” (John 20:28-29 ULB)

>But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to __the Holy Spirit__ and to keep back part of the price of the land?... You have not lied to men, but to __God__.” (Acts 5:3-4 ULB)


Each Person is also distinct from the other two Persons. All three Persons can appear separately at the same time.
>After he was baptized, __Jesus__ came up... from the water... He saw the __Spirit__ of God coming down..., and a __voice__ [the Father's] came out... saying, "This is my Beloved __Son__..." (Matthew 3:16-17 ULB)
God the Son is baptized while God the Spirit comes down and God the Father speaks from heaven.
