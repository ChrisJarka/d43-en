====== New Covenant ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "new covenant" refers to the commitment or agreement God made with his people through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus. 

a covenant with Israel through his prophet Moses, and later promised that he would make a New Covenant with his people.

  * The New Covenant is better than the old one because it is based on the sacrifice of Jesus for the sins of everyone.
  * This New Covenant came into effect when God's Son died and came back to life.
  * Believers keep the New Covenant by trusting God to forgive them and save them because of the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus.

  * The New Covenant will be fulfilled when God establishes his reign on earth. Everything will once again be very good, as it was at creation. There will be no more sin, suffering, or injustice. Instead, all of God's people will dwell with him in peace, love, and harmony.

  * **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:48-11|[48-11]]]** But God has now made a **New Covenant**  that is available to everyone. Because of this **New Covenant**, anyone from any people group can become part of God's people by believing in Jesus.
