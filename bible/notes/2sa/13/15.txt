\p
\v 15 Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love
wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.
\v 16 And she said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is
worse than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to her.
\v 17 Then he called his servant that ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after
her.
