====== Phase 1 Reviewer Checklist ======

Before publishing Phase 1 tN's, the reviewer should refer to the topics below.

==== Notes to Remove ====

  * Remove tN's that state information that is plainly obvious.

  * Remove tN's that are adequately clear in the UDB.


==== Notes to Add ====

  * Add __brief__ tN's for important topics that are not addressed in the tN's.

  * Add notes to indicate significant optional meanings for phrases, if not in the tN's.

==== Notes to Correct ====

  * Correct formatting of notes.

  * Correct tN's that are wrong (saying a plural is singular, for ex.).

  * Check for correct Important Words for the ULB, and that they are linked to the right pages.


==== Communication with Teams ====

  * Notify the Notes Manager if there are recurring or important errors of omissions in the notes that the notes team needs to correct.

  * Notify the KT Team if there are changes needed to content of terms, or terms that should be added or removed.

  * Notify the Text Team of issues or concerns with the ULB and UDB texts.
