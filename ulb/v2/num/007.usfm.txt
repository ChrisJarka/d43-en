\v 1 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified
it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them;
\v 2 that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathersâ€™ houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes, these are
they that were over them that were numbered:
\v 3 and they brought their oblation before Jehovah, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes,
and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle.
\v 4 And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 5 Take it of them, that they may be used in doing the service of the tent of meeting; and you shall give them
to the Levites, to every man according to his service.
\v 6 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
\v 7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service:
\v 8 and four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar
the son of Aaron the priest.
\v 9 But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them; they bare it upon their
shoulders.
\v 10 And the princes offered for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their
oblation before the altar.
\v 11 And Jehovah said to Moses, They shall offer their oblation, each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar.
