===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 This is why we always thank God, because when you heard the message that we told to you, you accepted it as the true message, the good message that God gave to us. We ourselves did not invent it. We also thank God that he is changing your lives because you trust this message.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 13 For this reason we also thank God constantly. For when you received from us God's message that you heard, you accepted it not as the word of man. Instead, you received it as it truly is, the word of God. It is this word that is also at work among you who believe.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information** - Paul continues to use "we" to refer to himself and his traveling companions and "you" to the Thessalonian believers.

  * **you received it as it truly is, the word of God** - The Thessalonians believed the message Paul preached as coming from God, not from Paul's own authority.
  * **It is this word that is also at work among you who believe** - Paul speaks of the word of God, that is, God's gospel message, as if it were a person that was doing work. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) However, even as personification, this expression actually stands for God, who works through his word (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
