\c 46
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah; set to Alamoth. A Song.
\q
\v 1 God is our refuge and strength,
\q A very present help in trouble.
\q
\v 2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change,
\q And though the mountains be shaken into the heart of the seas;
\q
\v 3 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,
\q Though the mountains tremble with the swelling thereof. \qs [Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 4 There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God,
\q The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.
\q
\v 5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved:
\q God will help her, and that right early.
\q
\v 6 The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved:
\q He uttered his voice, the earth melted.
\q
\v 7 Jehovah of hosts is with us;
\q The God of Jacob is our refuge. \qs [Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 8 Come, behold the works of Jehovah,
\q What desolations he has made in the earth.
\q
\v 9 He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth;
\q He breaks the bow, and cuts the spear in sunder;
\q He burns the chariots in the fire.
\q
\v 10 Be still, and know that I am God:
\q I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.
\q
\v 11 Jehovah of hosts is with us;
\q The God of Jacob is our refuge. \qs [Selah\qs*
