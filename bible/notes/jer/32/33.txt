\v 33 My people have turned away from me and have refused to return to me. Even though I taught them things many times, they would not pay attention to what I taught them, and they would not obey me.
\v 34 They have set up their detestable idols even in my own \f + \ft metonymy \f* temple and defiled it\f + \ft Or: caused it become a place that is unacceptable for people to worship me \f*.
\v 35 They have built shrines to \add honor\add* Baal in Ben-Hinnom Valley \add outside Jerusalem\add*, and there they sacrifice their sons and daughters to their god Molech. I never commanded them to do such horrible deeds. I never even thought that anyone might do such a terrible thing. And by doing it they have caused all the people of Judah to \add be guilty of having\add* sinned."

\v 33 And they have turned to me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet
they have not listened to receive instruction.
\v 34 But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
\v 35 And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their
daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they
should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
