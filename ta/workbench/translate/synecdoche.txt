Synecdoche is when a speaker uses a part of something to refer to the whole or uses the whole to refer to a part.

===== Description =====

Synecdoche is when a speaker uses a part of something to refer to the whole or uses the whole to refer to a part.

**__My soul__ exalts the Lord.** (Luke 1:46b)\\
Mary was was very happy about what the Lord was doing, so she referred to her soul, the part of herself that has emotions, to refer to her whole self.

**__the Pharisees__ said to him, "Look, why are they doing something that is not lawful ...?"** (Mark 2:24)\\
The reader is supposed to understand that the Pharisees standing there did not all say the same words at the same time. Instead, it is more likely that one man representing the group said those words.

**Reason this is a translation issue**\\
Some readers may take the words literally, or they might know that they are not to take the words literally but extend the meaning incorrectly.

===== Example from the Bible =====

**I looked on all the deeds that __my hands__ had accomplished** (Ecclesiastes 2:11)\\
"My hands" is a synecdoche for the whole person, because clearly the legs and the rest of the body and the mind were also involved.

===== Translation Strategies =====

If leaving the synecdoche in would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider doing so. If not, here are other options:
  - State specifically what the synecdoche refers to.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. State specifically what the synecdoche refers to.

  * **__My soul__ magnifies the Lord.** (Luke 1:46b)
    * "__I__ magnify the Lord."
  * **__the Pharisees__ said to him** (Mark 2:24)
    * "__a representative of the Pharisees__ said to him"
  * **I looked on all the deeds that __my hands__ had accomplished** (Ecclesiastes 2:11)
    * "I looked on all the deeds that __I__ had accomplished"
