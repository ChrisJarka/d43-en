==== Description ==== 

In discourse, the end of the story can be used to give several different types of information. This information is different from the actions that make up the main part of the story. A book of the Bible is often made up of many smaller stories that are part of the larger story of the book itself. For example, the story of Jesus' birth is a smaller story in larger story of the book of Luke. Each of these stories, whether large or small, can have information at the end of it. 

===Different purposes for end of story information:===

  * to summarize the story
  * to give a comment about what happened in the story
  * to connect a smaller story to the larger story it is a part of
  * to tell the reader what happens to a specific character after the main part of the story ends
  * to tell on-going action that continues after the main part of the story ends
  * to tell what happens after the story as a result of the events that happened in the story itself

=== Reasons this is a translation issue: === 

  * Translators need to know the information at the end of a story may contain a different type of information than they find in main part of the story.
  * Translators will need to translate the story in a way that their own readers will understand the the information given at the end of the story and how it connects to the story it is a part of.

Translation Principles
  * Different languages have different ways of showing that a story is ending. 
    * Some may use a passive construction at the end

3. to tell the reader what happens to a specific character after the main part of the story ends

4. to tell on-going action that continues after the main part of the story ends
> All who heard it were amazed at what was spoken to them by the shepherds. __But Mary kept thinking about all the things she had heard, treasuring them in her heart.__ (Luke 2:18-19 ULB)

5. to tell what happens after the story as a result of the events that happened in the story itself
