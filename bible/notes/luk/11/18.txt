\v 18 Similarly, if Satan and his demons were fighting against each other, his rule over them would certainly not last! I say this because you are saying that I am expelling demons by the power of the ruler of his own demons!
\v 19 Furthermore, if it is true that Satan enables me to expel demons, is it also true that your disciples who expel demons do so by Satan's power ? No, that is not true. So they will show that you are not thinking logically.
\v 20 But because it is by the power  rule people's lives has come to you."

\v 18 And since you say I cast out demons by Beezelbul, how will his kingdom stand if Satan is divided against himself?
\v 19 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? Because of this, they will be your judges.
\v 20 But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
