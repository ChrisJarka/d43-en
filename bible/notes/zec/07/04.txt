\v 4 Then the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels gave me a message.
\v 5 He said, "Tell \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the priests and all the other people of Judah that during the past 70 years, when they mourned and fasted during the fifth and seventh months \add of each year\add*, it was not really \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* me, Yahweh, whom they were \add honoring\add*.
\v 6 And when they ate and drank, it was really \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* to \add benefit\add* themselves.
\v 7 That is certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what I continually told the former prophets to proclaim \add to the people\add*, when Jerusalem and the nearby towns were prosperous and filled with people, and people also lived in the desert area to the south and in the foothills to the west."

\v 4 Then Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, gave me a message.
\v 5 He told me to say this to the priests and, in fact, to everyone in the whole land: "Tell me whom you were honoring when you did not eat but went around in dirty clothing. You were not really honoring me, were you?
\v 6 And when you feasted at my temple, you did it just to have a good time; you did not really intend to honor me, did you?
\v 7 This is exactly what I kept telling the former prophets to proclaim to the people, when the people in Jerusalem and the nearby towns were many and prosperous, and when people also lived in the southern Judean wilderness, and in the foothills to the west."

\v 4 So the word of Yahweh of hosts came to me and said,
\q
\v 5 "Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests and say, 
\q 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the
seventh month 
\q for these seventy years, were you truly fasting for me?
\q
\v 6 And when you ate and drank, did you not eat and drink for yourselves?
\q
\v 7 Weren't these the same words that Yahweh proclaimed by the mouth of the former prophets, 
\q when you still inhabited Jerusalem and the surrounding cities in prosperity and were settled in the Negev, and the foothills to the west?'"
