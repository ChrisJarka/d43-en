===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Have I not declared to you long ago, and announced it?** - Yahweh is using this question to emphasize and remind them of the events he had predicted to them in the past. Events that have come to pass since then. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **Is there any God besides me?** - Yahweh is using a question once again to emphasize the fact that there is no other God. He is their only God. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **There is no other Rock; I know of none** - Here Yahweh is comparing himself to a Rock that protects the people of Israel. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
