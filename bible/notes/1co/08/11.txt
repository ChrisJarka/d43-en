\v 11 As a result, you who know that \add idols are not really alive\add*, might cause that fellow believer, one for whom Christ died, to be ruined \add spiritually\add*\f + \ft Or: to stop believing \add in Christ\add* \f*.
\v 12 By sinning against your fellow believer by causing him to do something that he thinks God does not allow us to do, \add it is as though\add* you are sinning against Christ himself!
\v 13 So if \add I, Paul, think that by\add* eating a certain food I might cause a fellow believer to be ruined spiritually, I will never eat such food again. I do not want to cause any fellow believer to be ruined spiritually\f + \ft Or: to stop believing in Christ \f*. \add And you should\add* \add do as I do\f + \ft Or: imitate my example\add* \f*.

\v 11 As a result, if your weaker brother or sister sees you eat meat that was offered to idols, they may decide to stop trusting in Christ. So your brother or sister, for whom Christ died, will perish.
\v 12 So, you sin against your weaker brothers and sisters when you encourage them to do something that their mind tells them not to do. And this is sinning against Christ.
\v 13 Therefore, if food causes my brother or sister to trust Christ less, I will never eat meat again! For I do not want them to do anything that they believe is a sin.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 So because of your understanding about true nature of idols, the weaker brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed.
\v 12 Thus, when you sin against your brothers and sisters and wound their weak consciences, you sin against Christ. 
\v 13 Therefore, if food causes my brother or sister to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause my brother or sister to fall into sin.
