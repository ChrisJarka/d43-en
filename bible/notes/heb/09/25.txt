====== Hebrews 09:25-26 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 The \add Jewish\add* high priest enters the very holy place once every year, taking blood that is not his own, \add to offer it as a sacrifice\add*. But when Christ entered heaven, it was not in order to offer himself repeatedly like that.
\v 26 \add If that were so\add*, he would have needed to suffer \add and shed his blood\add* repeatedly since \add the time when God\add* created the world. But instead, in this final age, \add Christ\add* has appeared once in order that by sacrificing himself he could cause \add that people\add* no longer will be \add punished for their\add* sins.

\v 26 If that were so, he would have needed to suffer and shed his blood repeatedly since the time when God created the world. But instead, in this final age, Christ has appeared once so that by sacrificing himself, God will forgive all our sins and will not condemn us any more because we have sinned.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 25 He did not go there in order to offer himself often, as does the high priest, who enters the most holy place year by year with another's blood. 
\v 26 If that were true, then it would have been necessary for him to suffer many times since the world's foundation. But now it is just one time at the end of the ages that he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
