===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 44 You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.
TEV has "with a cloud of fury," instantiating the same conc. met. in the previous verse. Alternatively, this cloud can be seen as an obstacle to prayers getting through to God. 
\q
\v 45 You have made us cast-offs and refuse among the peoples.

I prefer "the peoples" here as more or less formal equivalence to haammim, instead of "nations," but it's a minor point since here the sense seems to be the same.
\q
\v 46 All our enemies have opened their mouth against us.
Yes, in the sense of mocking, as in 2:16.

\q
\v 47 Fear of the pit have come upon us, desolation and crushing.

I propose fear of the pit (i.e., a trap) as hendiadys. I incline toward "crushing" instead of "collapse" here, as a sec. sense of sheber 'what happens to grain--it gets crushed a mill.'
