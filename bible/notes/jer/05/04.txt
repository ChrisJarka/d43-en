====== Jeremiah 05:4-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 I thought, "\add We cannot expect\add* these people \add to act righteously, because they\add* are poor;
\q2 they do not have any sense.
\q1 They do not know the way Yahweh wants them to conduct their lives;
\q2 they do not know what God requires them to do.
\q1
\v 5 So, I will go and talk to their leaders,
\q2 because they surely know how God wants them to conduct their lives."
\q1 But they also have stopped obeying Yahweh \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\q2 and they will not allow him to lead them.
\q1
\v 6 Because of that, lions will come out of the forests and kill them;
\q2 wolves from the desert will attack them;
\q2 leopards that lurk\f + \ft Or: wait \f* outside their cities will maul anyone who walks outside the cities.
\q1 Those things will happen because the people have sinned very much against God
\q2 and have turned away from him very frequently.

\p
\v 4 Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they know not the way of Jehovah, nor the law of their God:
\v 5 I will get me to the great men, and will speak to them; for they know the way of Jehovah, and the law of their God.
But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.
\v 6 Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard shall watch
against their cities; every one that goes out thence shall be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many,
and their backslidings are increased.
