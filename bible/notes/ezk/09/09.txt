\v 9 He said to me, "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of blood and the city full 
perversions, since they say, 'Yahweh has forgotten the land,' and 'Yahweh does not see!'
\v 10 So then, my eye will not look with compassion, and I will not spare them. I will instead bring it all on their heads."
\v 11 And behold! The man dressed in linen who had the scribe's equipment by his side icame back. He reported and said, 'I have done all that you have commanded.'"
