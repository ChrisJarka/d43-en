**What is the Book of Psalms?**\\

The Book of Psalms is a collection of songs that were originally written for different purposes: to praise God, to ask him for help, to confess, to beg for mercy, to ask for victory over Israel’s enemies, to celebrate a new king of Israel, to praise the city of Jerusalem, and to instruct people in how to be wise, that is, in how to obey the Law of Moses and to honor God. In addition, some psalms were written for pilgrims to sing on their way to worship in Jerusalem. Some psalms apparently became favorite songs of praise to sing in the temple worship of God.

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
The Hebrew title of this book means, "Songs of Praise." Translators may to express this meaning in their own languages, or they may choose to transliterate a name from other language versions if it is well-known. For example, the French title "Les Psaumes" might be understood by everyone in the project language.

**When was the Book of Psalms written?**\\

The Psalms were written from the 15th Century BC to about the time they were collected in the 3rd Century BC. One of the earliest psalms was written by Moses perhaps about 1400 BC. David’s psalms have been dated between 1020 and 975 BC. Asaph’s psalms are probably from the same time as David’s. The psalms of Korah may have come from the time just before the exile.   

No psalm is identified clearly as having been written after the exile. Psalms 126 and 137 appear to be from the period after the exile.

**What are the Messianic psalms?**\\

Some of the psalms, called Messianic psalms, contain passages that the New Testament writers considered were written about the coming Messiah, who turned out to be Jesus Christ. The Messianic psalms are Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 34, 40, 41, 45, 68, 69, 89, 102, 109, 110, and 118. Each is cited at least one time in the New Testament.

**What are superscriptions in the Psalms?**\\

Superscriptions are the information that is given before the beginning of many psalms. Seventy-three psalms are called “A psalm of David,” which may mean they were written by King David, for David, or perhaps in the style of David. For some psalms, the superscriptions give the historical situations in which they were written.

Some superscriptions give instructions about how they should be played and sung, with what instruments, with which singers, and apparently sometimes with which melodies. Fifty-five psalms are addressed “to the choirmaster” or “chief musician;” these seem to have been specially meant for use in temple worship.

Some of the Hebrew expressions in the superscriptions are difficult to understand, so versions have different translations.  

English versions do not traditionally give verse numbers to the superscriptions, but many versions in other languages do. Whatever choice is made in other versions, the superscriptions in the Psalms should be considered as part of the divinely inspired biblical test.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**Why does the ULB display the psalms as poetry, but the UDB does not?**\\

The Psalms were written as Hebrew poetry. This style uses poetic lines that stand in different kinds of relationships with each other. Usually they are “parallel” to each other. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]].) The ULB show these lines of poetry in English. 

Translators will have to decide whether or not to present the Psalms as poetry in their own language. This decision may well make it necessary to consider whether their language has poetic forms that are suitable for expressing the thought of the Psalms. 

It is also certain that some translators will decide to translate into prose instead. The UDB provides a model for these translators.


**Why do some versions number the Psalms differently than others?**\\

There have been different numbering systems for the Psalms from ancient times. The Septuagint, an ancient Greek version of the Hebrew Old Testament, numbered many psalms differently, so two systems passed down through the centuries and are still with us today. Translators will probably want to use the system that most versions in their own country use.
