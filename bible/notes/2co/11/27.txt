\v 27 in work and hardship, in many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and nakedness.
\v 28 Besides those other things, there is the daily pressure I experience, concern for all the churches.
\v 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to sin, and I do not burn with distress?
