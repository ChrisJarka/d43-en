<usfm>
\v 5  \add Now I want to write about the man who\add* caused all this anguish. \add What he did was very wrong, but\add* I know that it has caused you much more sorrow than it has caused me, because  \add what he did\add* has  \add affected\add* all of you  \add to some extent. I say\add*, "to some extent," \add because I do not want to say that he has\add* done more harm  \add than he really has done\add*.
\v 6  \add Since he has now stopped sinning in that way\add*, the punishment that nearly all of you  \add decided was right for him\add* has continued long enough.
\v 7 So now, instead  \add of punishing him any longer\add*, you need to forgive him and deal kindly with him. \add If you do not forgive him\add*, he may become so sad that he will begin to  \add think that you will never forgive him\add* \f + \ft Or: will stop  \add believing in Christ\add* \f*.

\v 5 But if anyone has caused grief, he has caused grief, not to me, but to some extent--so that I do not make too much of it--to you all.
\v 6 This punishment by the majority is enough for such a person,
\v 7 so that now instead, you should forgive and encourage him, so that he is not overwhelmed by too much sorrow.
