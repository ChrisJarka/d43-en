====== Ecclesiastes 03:19-20 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 because what happens to people happens to animals. Animals die, and people die. We all must breathe \add to remain alive\add*. People have no advantage over animals \add in that\add*, so I have a difficult time in understanding that.
\v 20 People and animals all die and are buried. We are all made of soil, and \add when we die\add*, our corpses become soil again.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 What happens to people happens to animals. Animals die, and people die. We all must breathe to remain alive. People have no advantage over animals in that way. Everything disappears so quickly.
\v 20 People and animals all die and are buried. We are all made of soil, and when we die, our corpses become soil again.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 For the fate of the children of mankind and the fate of animals is the same fate for them. The death of one is like the death of the other. The breath is the same for all of them. There is no advantage for mankind over the animals. For is not everything just a breath?
\v 20 Everything is going to the same place. Everything comes from the dust, and everything returns to the dust.
</usfm>

  * **The breath is the same for all of them** - "All of them breathe the same"
  * **There is no advantage for mankind over the animals** - "Mankind is no better off than the animals"
  * **is not everything just a breath?** - Here the authors speaks of everything being temporary as if it were a breath of air. The author uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that everything is temporary. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "Everything is just a breath" or "Everything is as temporary as a breath" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Everything is going to the same place** - This means that all people and all animals die and decay and become part of the soil. AT: "Everything dies and goes to the same place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **dust** - "soil"
