\v 1 Long ago God communicated frequently to our ancestors in various ways by what the prophets said and wrote.
\v 2 But now when this final age is beginning, God has communicated to us by his own Son. God has chosen him to possess all things. By him God also created the universe.
\v 3 God's Son is the light of God's powerful brilliance. He shows exactly what God is truly like. All things that existâ€”he keeps them existing by giving powerful commands. After he had achieved that all sin should be forgiven, he rose into heaven and sat down at the highest place of honor, at the right side of God the Father, where he rules with him.

\v 1  Long ago God spoke to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in many ways,
\v 2 but in these last days God has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed as the heir of all things and  through whom he also made the universe.
\v 3 His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very character of his essence, and he sustains all things by the word of his power. After he had made cleansing for the sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.
