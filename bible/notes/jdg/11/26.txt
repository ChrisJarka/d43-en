\v 26 While Israel lived for three hundred years in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side
of the Arnon—why then did you not recover them within that time?
\v 27 So I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. May Yahweh, the Judge, be judge today between the people of Israel and the people of Ammon.”
\v 28 However, the king of the people of Ammon did not listen to the message that Jephthah sent him.
