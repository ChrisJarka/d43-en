====== God ======

===== Facts: =====

God is the eternal one. He alone existed before anything else, and he will continue to exist forever. He created the universe and all living beings. He is infinitely wise, infinitely powerful, and sovereign. The one true God exists as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

  * As creator and sustainer of the universe, God provides for everything in his creation.
  * God is perfectly righteous, sinless, just, merciful, and loving.
  * People were created to worship God and he is the only God they should worship. All other "gods" are false.
  * Because God is holy and just, he must punish sin; yet in his mercy he has provided the way for people to be saved from that punishment, through Jesus.
  * God is a covenant-keeping God, who always fulfills his promises.
  * God reveals himself through his creation and through the Bible.
  * Other ways that the Bible refers to God include, "Most High God" or "Holy One" or "Father" or "Lord God".
  * The word "god" is used to refer to false gods and idols that people worshiped. Most translations distinguish these by capitalizing the word for the one true God. Another way to do this would be to use a completely different word for the true God.
