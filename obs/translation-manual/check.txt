===== How to Check Open Bible Stories =====

When all 50 stories are translated, we encourage each language to check the stories through the three levels of checking outlined below. 

The strategy for quality assurance of unfoldingWord content, including Open Bible Stories, is described briefly here and in detail in the document [[http://distantshores.org/resources/whitepapers/quality-assurance|“Quality Assurance of Open-License Biblical Content”]].

We use a three-level, Church-centric approach for identifying the fidelity of translated Biblical content:

  * Level 1: internal — Translator (or team) affirms that translation is in line with Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines.
  * Level 2: external — Translation is independently checked and confirmed by at least two others not on the translation team.
  * Level 3: authenticated — Translation is checked and confirmed by leadership of at least one Church network with native speakers of the language.

==== Checking Level 1 – Internal Check ====

The translator (or translation team) asserts that the Statement of Faith is an accurate reflection of their own beliefs and that the translated content is also in harmony with it. 

The translator (or translation team) asserts that the translated content has been done in accordance with the Translation Guidelines and that they have made full use of available exegetical and translation checking resources in the translation process. 

//This enables the broadest reach of the content as an active project, with an open invitation (implied or direct) to help improve the translation. //

==== Checking Level 2 – External Check ====

The content has been comprehensively reviewed by at least 3 speakers of both the target language and one of the languages in which the source text is available. The reviewers should not be related to, or otherwise closely connected with the translator (or translation team). Usually the reviewers will be the translator + 2 other people, e.g., pastors of other denominations in the language. 

As in Level 1, the translated content is compared to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines and the checkers assert that the translated content is in agreement with both. 

//This implements the concept of a “testimony of two or three witnesses” in the checking process. //

==== Checking Level 3 – Authenticated Check ====

The content has been checked by an accountable entity in the un-foldingWord network. Entities such as translation organizations and church denominations can be part of the unfoldingWord network if they desire, given that they agree with the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines and are publicly accountable in some way to constituents who are part of the Church (including donors, members, etc.). Based on the strength of the trust relationship between entities, the unfoldingWord network can grow rapidly and it be- comes self-reinforcing as multiple nodes connect to each other.

The checking entity must have a track record that supports their assertion that they adhere to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines.

//This implements a “by their fruit you will know them” component. //

==== Ongoing Checking ==== 

As translated content is checked by more people, using freely-available resources and following the established doctrinal and procedural guidelines for the unfoldingWord project, the content is iteratively improved and checked to increasingly higher levels of quality.  The checked translations are made available in the unfoldingWord “catalog” of available content and labeled according to the checking level. 
The process and checking framework depends on an ongoing process of checking and revising content, as determined by the Church that uses the content. Feedback loops are encouraged (and modeled in translation software, where feasible) with a view to maximizing input from the greatest number of users of the content. The translations of the content are made available on the Door43 translation platform, (https://door43.org) which is designed to make it easy for users to collaboratively create content that increases in quality over time.
