<usfm>
\v 17 You may be thanking God very well, but you are not helping them.
\v 18 I thank God that I speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that I have not learned\add* more than any of you do.
\v 19 But during a worship service, \add in order that others will understand what I am saying\add*, I would prefer to speak five words using my mind, in order that I may teach others, rather than to speak ten thousand words in a language \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that is not understood by the congregation\add*.

\v 17 For if you give thanks in your spirit, that is well and good for you, but another person who doesn't understand what you are thankful for, will not know words you used to thank God, and then they are not helped by what you do, even though you are blessed in your spirit, they are not.
\v 18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than any of you do, for I am worshiping God in my spirit, and that is a blessing in my life.
\v 19 But to the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, words which can be explained and understood by all those worshiping, so they might be taught something they can use in their lives, than ten thousand words in a tongue which they cannot understand and I cannot translate it.
