\v 7 You must realize, therefore, that it is those who trust \add in what Christ has done who\add* are \add like\add* Abraham's descendants \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add because they trust in God as Abraham did\add*.
\v 8 Furthermore, God planned beforehand that it was \add when\add* non-Jews trusted \add him\add* that he would erase the record of their sins. \add Moses wrote in\add* the Scriptures \f + \ft personification \f* this good message that God told Abraham: "Because of \add what\add* you \add did\add*, I will bless \add people in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* all nations."

\v 6 As Abraham "believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness,"
\v 7 understand, therefore, that they who believe are sons of Abraham.
\v 8 The scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith. The gospel was proclaimed  beforehand to Abraham, "In you all the nations will be blessed."
\v 9 So then those who have faith are blessed by Abraham, the father of faith.
