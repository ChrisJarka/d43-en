  * **What is that coming up** - "What is this group of people that is coming up"
  * **coming up from the wilderness** - The group of people is traveling from the desert to Jerusalem. Because the desert is low in the Jordan valley and Jerusalem is high in the mountains, the the group of people needs to go up in order to get to Jerusalem. 
  * **like a column of smoke** - People in the group were burning incense, and columns of smoke were going up into the air. So, the group of people looked like they were columns of smoke as they came up out  of the desert. AT: "with columns of smoke going up." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
