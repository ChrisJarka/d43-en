Yahweh compares the army of Assyria to a weapon a person holds in his hand and hits other people with it. It emphasizes that the army of Assyria is a tool that Yahweh uses to punish Israel. Alternate translation: "It will be like a weapon in my hands and I will use it to show my anger. (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]] and [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
