Please read the information on [[en:ta:vol1:process:publishing_process]] before publishing your work.

==== Upload the Translation Project ====

When you publish your work there are several steps to the process. The process begins in translationStudio when you select **Upload** from the 3 dot icon menu. This uploads the translation to the Door43 repository. See [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_d43upload]] for step-by-step instructions.

==== Documentation Process ====

The process continues when you submit the **Request to Publish** (https://git.door43.org/Door43/SourceTextRequestForm/issues/new) form for your translation to appear in the unfoldingWord website and applications. The Gateway Language translations will also show in translationStudio as a source text and translationHelps. 

The Request to Publish form includes several pieces of data such as your contact information, the requested checking level, translation contributors, etc. The person who reviews the request will verify that each contributor provided a legal signature.

==== Questions Regarding the Request to Publish Form and Process ====

=== What Happens After Text is Approved? ===

When the Request to Publish is approved, the text is made available on unfoldingword.org for online viewing, as a downloadable, print-ready PDF, and it appears in the unfoldingWord app.

=== Can Text Be Changed After Level 3 Checking? ===

Approved text can always be modified in translationStudio even after all checking levels are completed, HOWEVER if you or another user were to submit a Request to Publish for text that has already completed Level 3 checking, there would be questions regarding the reason for overwriting the previously published and checked materials. The approver will look to see who contributed to the change and may contact the requestor and others involved with the translation of the text in question to ensure the changes are valid.

=== Must All Contributors Be Named? ===

Due to copyright laws (and these exist no matter what country you are in and no matter what people tell you about laws in that country), you must list __every__ contributor on the Request to Publish form and provide a legal signature for each person. In certain cases we understand they cannot be named, however you can provide the established pseudonym for that person.
