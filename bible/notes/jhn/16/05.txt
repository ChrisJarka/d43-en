\v 5 But now I go to him that sent me; and none of you asks me, Whither go thou?
\v 6 But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
\v 7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not
come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
