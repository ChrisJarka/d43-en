\v 2 Yahweh is very wise,
\q2 but he also causes people to experience disaster!
\q1 And \add when he decides to do that\add*,
\q2 he does not change his mind!

\c 31
\p
\q1
\v 1 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and lean on horses, 
\q1 and trust in chariots (for they are many) and in 
horsemen (for they are countless). 
\q1 But they are not concerned about the Holy One of Israel, nor do they seek Yahweh!
\q1
\v 2 Yet he is wise, and he will bring disaster and will not retract his words. 
\q1 And he will arise against the evil house and against the helpers of those who commit sin.
