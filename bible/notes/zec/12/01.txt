\v 1 The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.
\p Thus says Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and formeth the
spirit of man within him:
\v 2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it be in the
siege against Jerusalem.
\v 3 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden
themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.
