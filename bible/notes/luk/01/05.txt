===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **In the days of Herod, king of Judea**  – That is, "During the time that King Herod was ruling over Judea."
    * **Judea**  – Another way to translate this would be, "the region of Judea" or, "Judea Region." Some languages may need to say, "the people who lived in Judea."
    * **there was a certain**  - That is, "there was a particular" or, "there was a". This is a way of introducing an important character in a story. Consider how your language does this.
    * **from the division of Abijah**  - Some translations may start a new sentence here, as the UDB does.
    * **division**  - That is, "division of priests" or, "group of priests."
    * **of Abijah**  - That is, "who descended from Abijah." Abijah was an ancestor of this group of priests and all of them were descended from Aaron, who was the first Israelite priest.
    * **His wife**  - It may be more clear in some languages to say, "Zechariah's wife" here.
    * **was from the daughters of**  - That is, "was also one of the descendants of" or, "was also descended from Aaron." Another way to say this sentence would be, "Zechariah and his wife Elizabeth were both descended from Aaron."
    * **before God**  - That is, "in God's sight" or, "in God's opinion."
    * **walking **  - That is, "obeying" or, "and obeyed."
    * **blamelessly**  - This could also be translated as, "without fault" or, "perfectly."
    * **all the Lord's commandments and requirements**  - This could also be translated as, "all that the Lord had commanded and required."
    * **But**  – This contrast word shows that what follows here is the opposite of what is expected. People expected that if they did what was right, God would allow them to have children. Although this couple did what was right, they did not have any children.
    * **was barren**  - That is, "was not able to bear children" as in the UDB.
