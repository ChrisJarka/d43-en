\v 18 The Lord Yahweh says this: 'In the first month, on the first day of the month, you will take an unblemished bull from the herd and perform a sin offering for the sanctuary.
\v 19 The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering and place it on the doorposts of the house and on the four corners of the border of the altar, and on the doorposts of the gate to the inner court.
\v 20 You will do this on the seventh of the month for each personâ€™s sin by accident or ignorance; in this way you will atone for the temple.
