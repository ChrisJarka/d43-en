\v 1 Now \add I will answer what you asked\add* about \add us believers\add* eating meat that has been sacrificed to idols. \add We know what some of you say, that God has enabled\add* all of us\add to\add* know \add the truth about things such as idols. But often we become\add* proud because we say that we know \add all those things\add*. But instead of being proud about what we know, we should show that we love \add our fellow believers by helping them to\add* become spiritually mature.
\v 2 Those who think that they thoroughly know something do not yet know it as they should.

\v 1 Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.
\v 2 If any man thinks that he knows anything, he does not yet know  as he ought to know.
\v 3 But if any man loves God, the same is known by him.
