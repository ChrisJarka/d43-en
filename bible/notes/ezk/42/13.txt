\v 13 Then the man said to me, "These rooms that overlook the temple on the north and south sides are holy. Here the priests who offer sacrifices to Yahweh will eat \add their portions of\add* the sacred offerings. Because these rooms are holy, they will be used to store the sacred offerings: The grain for the grain offerings, the offerings for the sins that people ave committed, and offerings in order that people will no longer be guilty for having sinned.
\v 14 When the priests leave the temple, they will not be allowed to \add immediately\add* enter the outer courtyard. First, they must remove the clothes that they hadbeen wearing inside the temple, because those clothes are holy. They must put on other clothes before they enter the parts of the temple area where the other people gather."

Here the priests who offer sacrifices to Yahweh will eat their portions of the sacred offerings. Because these rooms are holy, they will be used to store the sacred offerings: The flour for the flour offerings, the offerings for the sins that people have committed, and offerings in order that people will no longer be guilty for having sinned against one another.
\v 14 When the priests leave the temple, they will not be allowed to immediately enter the outer courtyard. First, they must remove the clothes that they had been wearing inside the holy place, because those clothes are holy, reserved for their work. They must put on other clothes before they enter the parts of the temple area where the other people gather."

\v 13 Then he said to me, “The northern halls and the southern halls that are in front of the forecourt: these are holy halls where the priests who are nearest to Yahweh may eat the most holy things. They will lay the most holy things there—the food offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering—for it is a holy place.
\v 14 When the priests enter there, they must not go out of the holy place to the outer court, but must lay the clothes in which they ministered there since these are holy. So they must dress in other clothes then draw near to what regards the people.”
