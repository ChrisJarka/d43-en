===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The author gives greetings and tells how he prays for them.
  * **General Information:** - Though Timothy is with Paul, it is generally assumed that he is the author and that Timothy writes as Paul speaks. Here the word "you" refers to the believers in the Philippian church. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) Here the word "our" probably refers to all believers in Christ - including Paul, Timothy, and the Philippian believers. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])

  * **Paul and Timothy** - If your language has a particular way of introducing the authors of a letter, use it here. 
  * **servants of Christ Jesus** - "We are servants of Christ Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **to all the ones set apart in Christ Jesus** - "to all the believers in Christ Jesus"
  * **the overseers and deacons** - AT: "the leaders of the church"
  * **May grace be to you** - This is a way to wish a blessing upon other people.
