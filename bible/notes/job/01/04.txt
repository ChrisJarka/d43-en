\v 4 Job's sons often held feasts in their houses. Whenever each one made a feast, he would invite all his brothers and sisters to come and eat together.
\v 5 After each celebration, Job would summon them and bless them. He would get up early in the morning, kill animals, and burn them on the altar as sacrifices, one for each of his children. For Job always said, "Perhaps my children have sinned and said something evil about God in their hearts."

\v 5 When the days of the feast were over, Job would send and consecrate them.He would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings, as many as the number of his children, for he would say, â€œ"Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Job always did this.
