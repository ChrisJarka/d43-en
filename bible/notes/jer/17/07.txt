===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he will be like a tree planted by water** - The person who trusts in Yahweh will always prosper, just like a tree does when it is planted by a river. It is not affected when there is no rain. This can be stated in active form. AT: "he will be like tree that someone has planted by water" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **It will not fear the heat when it comes ... It is not anxious in a year of drought** - Yahweh speaks of a tree that draws it water from a stream being unaffected by heat and drought as if the tree were unafraid of these things. AT: "It is not affected when the heat comes ... No harm is caused to it in a year of drought" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
