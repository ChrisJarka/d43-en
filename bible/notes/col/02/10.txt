<usfm>
\v 10 And God has filled you because you are now joined with Christ, who is the ruler over every angelic being with power and authority.
\v 11 God has also circumcised you. But God's circumcison is not done by human hands by removing flesh from the body. Rather, God's circumcision is done on the human spirit because Jesus has removed our condemnation and sinfulness.
\v 12 When you were baptized you were publicly demonstrating that you are now joined with Christ. It was as if God buried your old life and then raised you from the dead to live again with Christ because you trust in God who is working in your life with the same power with which he raised Jesus from the dead persons.
