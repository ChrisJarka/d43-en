===== Description =====

In the Bible, events are not always told in the order in which they occurred. Sometimes the author wanted to discuss something that happened at an earlier time than the event that he just talked about. This can be confusing to the reader.

**Reason this is a translation issue:** Readers might think that the events happened in the order that they are told. It is 
important to help them understand the correct order of events in a natural way when translating into your language.\\ 

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**But then Herod ... had John locked up in prison. Now it came about, while all the people were being baptized by John, that Jesus also was baptized.** (Luke 3:20-21) \\ 
This can sound like John baptized Jesus in prison.\\ 

**The group of soldiers carrying weapons marched in front of the priests who were blowing their trumpets, and the rest of the soldiers followed the four men carrying the chest... But Joshua commanded the people, saying, "Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths"** (Joshua 6:9-10)\\ 
This sounds like Joshua issued the order not to speak after the army had already started their march. \\  

** "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?"** (Revelation 5:2) \\ 
The seal locking the scroll must be broken before the scroll can be unrolled.

===== Translation Strategies =====
  - If your language uses phrases, time words or tenses to show that some event happened before the one mentioned here, consider using one of them. \\ 
  - If your language prefers to tell events in the order that they occure, consider reordering the events to put them in the right order. his may require putting two or more verses together (like 5-6).

==== Explanation ====

In the Bible, events are not always told in the order in which they occurred. Sometimes the author wanted to discuss something that happened at an earlier time than the event that he just talked about. Many languages do this by using different tenses or time words such as ‘earlier,’ ‘last year,’ or ‘before that.’ Other languages prefer to state the events in the order that they occurred to avoid confusion. For events that are told in the order in which they occurred, it is also necessary in many languages to mark the order of events with connecting words such as "after these things," "having done this," or "then." It is important to help your readers understand the correct order of events in a natural way when translating into your language.
