===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **this is his commandment** - AT: "this is what God wants us to do."
  * **we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ** - Eternal forgiveness and salvation are found in "the name of his Son Jesus Christ," the Son of God. If we purposely deny that Jesus is the Son of God, we go against God's words and his salvation. Translate "Son" in your language as God's word presents it.
  * **remains in him, and God in him** - See how this was translated in [[:en:bible:notes:1jn:02:04|2:5-6]].
