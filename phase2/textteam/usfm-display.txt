\v 9 Therefore pray like this: 
\q 'Heavenly Father, 
\q2 sanctify your name.
\q2
\v 10 Let your kingdom come. 
\q2 Let your will be done, 
\q3 as it is in heaven, so also on earth.

\s5
\q2 
\v 11 Give us today our daily bread.
\q2 
\v 12 Forgive us our debts, 
\q3 as we also have forgiven our debtors.
\q2 
\v 13 And do not bring us into temptation, 
\q3 but deliver us from the evil one.'
