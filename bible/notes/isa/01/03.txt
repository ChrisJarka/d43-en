===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **but Israel does not know, Israel does not understand** - Israel means "Jacob's descendants known as the people of Israel, the nation of Israel". A donkey or an ox is loyal to the one who feeds them, but the Israelites are not grateful for all that God has given them.
  * **Ah, nation, sinners, a people weighed down with iniquity, offspring of evil-doers, sons that act corruptly!**  - Isaiah speaks about the sinful nation of Israel who do evil when they know what is right.
  * **They have abandoned Yahweh, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they have estranged themselves from him.**  - The Israelites have turned their back on the Holy God of Israel
