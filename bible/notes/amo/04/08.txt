<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Two or three cities staggered to another city to drink water,
\q but were not satisfied.
\q Yet you have not returned to me
\q —this is Yahweh's declaration.
\q
\v 9 I afflicted you with blight and mildew.
\q The multitude of your gardens,
\q your vineyards,
\q your fig trees,
\q and your olive trees—
\q the locusts devoured them all.
\q Yet you have not returned to me
\q —this is Yahweh's declaration.
