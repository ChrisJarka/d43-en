\c 25
\p
\v 1 And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, set your face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them:
\v 3 and say to the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because you saidst,
Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the
house of Judah, when they went into captivity:
\v 4 therefore, behold, I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments
in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.
\v 5 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks: and you shall know that
I am Jehovah.
\v 6 For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have clapped your hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the
despite of your soul against the land of Israel;
\v 7 therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand upon you, and will deliver you for a spoil to the nations; and I will
cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries: I will destroy you; and you shall know
that I am Jehovah.
\p
\v 8 Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like to all the nations;
\v 9 therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of
the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,
\v 10 to the children of the east, to go against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that
the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations:
\v 11 and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
\p
\v 12 Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has
greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;
\v 13 therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and
I will make it desolate from Teman; even to Dedan shall they fall by the sword.
\v 14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger
and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord Jehovah.
\p
\v 15 Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul
to destroy with perpetual enmity;
\v 16 therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the
Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
\v 17 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall
lay my vengeance upon them.
