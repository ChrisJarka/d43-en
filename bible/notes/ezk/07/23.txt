  * ** and they will possess their houses**  - The word "they" refers to the wicked.  The word "their" refers to people of Israel.  
  * ** and they will possess their houses**  - The word "possess" means to have or own. "and the wicked will own the people of Israel's houses"
  * **Fear will come** - Fear is an emotion but here it is used like it is something physical and can move.  Alternate translation: "The people will be afraid"  (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:personification]])
