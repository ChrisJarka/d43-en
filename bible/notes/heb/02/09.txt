\v 9 But we do see him who has been made a little lower than the angels -- Jesus, because of his suffering death and crowned with glory and honor.  That was by the grace of God so that he      would taste of death for every man.
\v 10 For it honored him, because everyhing is for him, and everything is through him, for the purpose of bringing many sons to glory, and to make the author of their salvation complete through his sufferings.
