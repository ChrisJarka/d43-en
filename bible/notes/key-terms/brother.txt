====== brother ======


===== Definition: =====


A male who shares at least one biological parent with another male or female. A brother who shares only one parent with his sibling is called a 'half-brother'.


    * Since believers are sons and daughters of God the Father by adoption, Christians sometimes call each other brother or sister.
