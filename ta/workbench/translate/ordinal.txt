Ordinal numbers are numbers that tell either the position of something in a list or the order in which things happen. Some languages do not have special numbers that do these things. \\

**This was an evening and morning, the __first__ day.** (Genesis 1:5) \\ 
**This was an evening and morning, the __second__ day.** (Genesis 1:8) 


===== Description ===== 
Ordinal numbers are numbers that tell either the position of something in a list or the order in which things happen. 

**The __first__ lot went to Jehoiarib, the __second__ to Jedaiah, the __third__ to Harim, the __fourth__ to Seorim, … the __twenty-third__ to Delaiah, and the __twenty-fourth__ to Maaziah.** (1 Chronicles 24:7-18) \\
People tossed lots and one went to each of these people in the order given.

**…__first__ be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.** (Matthew 5:24) \\ 
Jesus was telling people that they needed to be reconciled to their brother before they offered their gift to God.
=== Ordinal Numbers in English === 

Most ordinal numbers in English simply have  "-th" added to the end.  \\

^Numeral ^Number ^Ordinal Number^ 
|4 |four |fourth| 
|10 |ten |tenth|
|100 |one hundred |one hundredth|
|1000 |one thousand |one thousandth|
 
Some ordinal numbers in English do not follow that pattern. \\ 
^Numeral ^Number ^Ordinal Number^  \\ 
|1 |one |first| 
|2 |two |second|
|3 |three |third|
|5 |five |fifth|
|12 |twelve |twelfth|
 
**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages do not have special numbers for showing the order of items in a list. There are different ways to deal with this. 
 
===== Examples from the Bible =====
Ordinal numbers are used in the Bible mainly to tell the position of something in a list. \\ 

**You must place in it four rows of precious stones. The __first__ row must have a ruby, a topaz, and a garnet. The __second__ row must have an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.  The __third__ row must have a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.  The __fourth__ row must have a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper. They must be mounted in gold settings.**  (Exodus 28:17-20)\\
This describes four rows of stones. The first row is probably be the top row, and the fourth row is probably the bottom row.
 
**He gave to the church __first__ apostles, __second__ prophets, __third__ teachers, then those who do powerful deeds** (1 Corinthians 12:28) \\ 
This is a list of workers that God gave to the church in their order. 

===== Translation Strategies =====
If your language has ordinal numbers and using them would give the right meaning, consider using them. If not, here are some strategies to consider.
  - Use the word "number" along with the number. 
  - Tell the total number of items, and then use "one" with the first item and "another" or "the next" with the rest.  
  - Simply tell the number of items and list the things associated with them. 
 
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ===== 
1. Use the word "number" along with the number. \\ 
  * **The name of the __second__ river is Gihon.** (Genesis 2:13) 
    * "The name of river __number two__ is Gihon." Genesis 2:13 
 
2. Tell the total number of items, and then use "one" with the first item and "another" or "the next" with the rest.  
  * **The first lot went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,  the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, … the twenty-third to Delaiah,  and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.**  (1 Chronicles 24:7-18)
    * "There were twenty-four lots. __One lot__ went to Jehoiarib, __another__ to Jedaiah, __another__  to Harim,…  __another__ to Delaiah, __and the last__ went to Maaziah." 
 
3.   Simply tell the number of items and list the things associated with them. 
  * **The first lot went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,  the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, … the twenty-third to Delaiah,  and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.**  (1 Chronicles 24:7-18)
    * "They cast 24 lots. The lots went to Jerhoiarib, Jedaiah, Harim, Seorim, … Delaiah, and Maaziah."
