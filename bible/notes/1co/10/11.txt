\v 11 All those things \add that happened to our ancestors long ago\add* are examples for us. \add Moses\add* wrote those things to warn us \add who are living now\add*. We are the people for whom God has fulfilled \add the things that he purposed in\add* the previous periods of time.
\v 12 So \add I say this to\add* all those who confidently \add think that they will always\add* steadfastly continue to \add believe what God said and will never disobey what he commanded\add*: Be careful that you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* do not sin \add when you are tempted\add*.
\v 13 \add Remember that\add* your desires to sin are the same desires that other people have. But when you are tempted to sin, you can trust God \add to help you\add*. He will not permit you to be tempted \f + \ft Or:anything to tempt you \f* more than you are able to resist. Instead, when you are tempted \f + \ft Or:things tempt you \f*, he will also provide a way \add for you\add* to endure it \add without sinning\add*.

\v 11 Now these things happened to our ancestors and they were written so we could learn from them. They are a few examples of the way the ages will come to an end, with judgment and retribution for those who do not obey God.
\v 12 The warning is for us all that we should not presume that we stand on good terms with God, but we should take care that we stand in obedience to his command and that we do not break away from him by our sins.
\v 13 No temptation has overtaken you that is not the normal experience of everyone. But God can be trusted and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability to bear it, but with that temptation he will also provide the means to overcome from it, so that you may be able either to escape its power, or to endure it by God's help, so when that testing come into your life, you will never be forced to sin.

\v 11 Now these things happened to them as examples for us, and they were written for our instructionâ€”for us upon whom the end of the ages has come. 
\v 12 Therefore let anyone who thinks he stands be careful that he does not fall.
\v 13 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to all humanity; but God is faithful: he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape so that you may be able to endure it.
