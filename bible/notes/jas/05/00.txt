====== James 05 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Eternity ==
This chapter contrasts living for things of this world which will not last with living for things that will matter [[:en:obe:kt:eternity|eternally]]. It is also important to live witht he expectation that Jesus will return soon.

== Oaths ==
Scholars are divided over whether this passage teaches that all oaths are wrong. Most scholars believe that some oaths are permissible but James wants Christians to have integrity.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Elijah ==
This story will be difficult to understand if the books of Kings and Chronicles have not yet been translated. 

== "Save his soul from death" ==
This probably indicates that the person who stops their [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sinful]] lifestyle will not be punished with physical [[:en:obe:kt:death]] as a consequence of their sin. On the other hand, some scholars believe this passage teaches about eternal [[:en:obe:kt:save|salvation]].
