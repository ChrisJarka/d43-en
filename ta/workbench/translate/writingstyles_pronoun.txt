===== Writing Styles - Pronoun Reference Systems =====
This module answers the questions: How do I understand the pronouns in the Bible and how to  find out how to use pronouns in my translation?

===== Description =====

Summary \\ 
When you handle pronouns in the way your language likes, people will easily understand who and what your translation is about.\\  

Definition \\ 
Pronouns are used to keep track of people or things without having to always repeat the noun. Usually a new person in a story will be first mentioned with a descriptive phrase, then the second time he will be mentioned with a simple name or noun but after that he will be referred to by a pronoun as long as it is clear who is being spoken of.\\  
Example \\ 
Now there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish Council. This man came to Jesus â€¦ Jesus replied to him \\ 

But each language has its particular rules and exceptions to this usual way of doing it. In languages in which the subject is marked in the verb, frequently pronouns are only used if the reference is unclear or is emphatic. In some language the main character is always referred to by a pronoun but in others he is only referred to by a name or noun and some languages have special pronouns for the main character. In many languages a noun is used instead of  pronouns when starting a new story or even a new paragraph. Most pronouns refer to something or someone already mentioned, however some languages allow a pronoun to precede the noun it replaces.

==== Reason this could be a translation issue ==== 
Understand pronouns in the Bible and knowing how to use pronouns in your translation are crucial for producing a translation that will be clearly understood.
