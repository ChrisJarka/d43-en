====== abyss ======


===== Definition: =====


An abyss is a large hole without a bottom.


    * In Scripture, the "abyss" is the current dwelling place of Satan and the dead who are apart from Christ.
    * Hell is described as a bottomless pit, possibly because there is no escape.
    * There are many words used to describe "hell".  There is a place where the dead, who are apart from Christ, dwell temporarily until the Great White Throne judgment (Revelation 20).  The words "shoel" and "hades" are used to describe this temporary location.  "Abyss" is likely a reference to this temporary dwelling place.  This place is to be distinguished from "gehenna" or the "lake of fire" where the dead will be punished after the Great White Throne judgment.
