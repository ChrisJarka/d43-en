\v 3 He said to them, "Tell this to Isaiah: 'King Hezekiah says that this is a day when we have great distress. Other nations are causing us to be insulted and disgraced. We are like \f + \ft simile \f* a woman who is about to give birth to a baby, but she does not have the strength that she needs to do it.
\v 4 But perhaps Yahweh our God has heard what the official from Assyria said. Perhaps he knows that his boss, the king of Assyria, sent him to insult the all-powerful God, and that Yahweh will punish the king of Assyria for what he said. And he requests that you pray for the few of us who are still alive \add here in Jerusalem\add*.'~"
