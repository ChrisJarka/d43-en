<usfm>
\v 15 My wise men and men who work magic have tried to read the writing on this wall and tell me what it means, but are not able to do it.
\v 16 Someone told me that you can tell what dreams mean and explain things that are very difficult to understand. If you can read these words and tell me what they mean, I will give you a purple \add robe like I wear because I am the king\add*, and I will put a gold chain around your neck. You will become a very important official in my kingdom; there will be only two others who will be more important than you will be."

\v 15 And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known
to me the interpretation thereof; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.
\v 16 But I have heard of thee, that you can give interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if you can read the writing,
and make known to me the interpretation thereof, you shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about your neck,
and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
