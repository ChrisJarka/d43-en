<usfm>
\q
\v 10 And there a woman met him, 
\q dressed like a prostitute, and she knew why she was there.
\q
\v 11 She is loud and wayward,
\q her feet do not stay at homeâ€”
\q
\v 12 now in the streets, now in the market,
\q at every corner she lies in wait. 
\q
\v 13 So she takes hold of him and kisses him 
\q and with a bold face she says to him,
\q
\v 14 "I have offered my peace offerings  
\q I have paid my vows; 
\q
\v 15 so came I out  to meet you,
\q to eagerly seek your face, and I have found you.
