===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **very advanced in years** - That is, "was very old."
    * **after her marriage**  - That is, "after she married him."
    * **a widow for eighty for years** - This either means that she had been a widow for 84 years or that she was a widow and was now 84 years old.
    * **never left the temple** - This is probably an exaggeration meaning that she spent so much time in the Temple that it seemed as though she never left it. It could be translated as, "was always at the temple" or it could state the meaning without the hyperbole: "was often at the temple." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
    * **with fastings and prayers** - That is, "by abstaining from food and by praying."
    * **came up to them** - That is, "approached them."
    * **the redemption of Jerusalem** - That is, "the one who would redeem Jerusalem" or "the person who would bring God's blessings and favor back to Jerusalem." Here the action "redemption" is used to refer to the the person who would do it. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
