\v 39 And Gideon said to God, Let not your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I
pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
\v 40 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
