\v 6 And the Spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.
\v 7 And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of
messengers, saying, Whosoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the dread of
Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man.
\v 8 And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty
thousand.
