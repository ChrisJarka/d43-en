===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I** - Here the word "I" refers to Yahweh.
  * **I will place mere youths as their leaders, and the young will rule over them** - These phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that bad leaders that will rule Judah. The words "youths" and "young" refer to grown men who act like children and are not good leaders. The Lord is exaggerating to emphasize his anger about the people's pride in Judah and what he will do to humble them. This could be translated as "I will cause men who act like children to be their leaders." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]] and [[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
  * **The people will be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor** - This can be translated with an active verb: "The people will harm one another, and a person will mistreat his neighbor." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * ** the degraded will challenge the honorable** - Here the words "degraded" and "honorable" refer to groups of people. This could be translated as "those without honor will not respect those with honor." (See: [[en:ta:translate:adjectivalnoun]])
