\v 16 \add Keep in mind that when people promise something\add*, they ask a more important person to punish them if they do not do what they promise. Furthermore, when people ask God to punish them \add if they do not tell the truth\add*, that causes the people who are disputing to stop disputing.
\v 17 So, when God wanted to demonstrate very clearly to us\f + \ft Or: to those people \f* who would receive what he had promised that he would not change what he had purposed \add to do\add*, he solemnly guaranteed that he would declare himself guilty if he did not do what he promised.
\v 18 He did that to strongly encourage us as a result of our \add knowing\add* that \add God has done\add* two things that cannot change. \add Namely, he promised to bless us, and he solemnly declared that he would declare himself guilty if he did not bless us\add*. We \add know\add* that God, who did those things, cannot lie. We have fled \add to him\add* in order that we might continue confidently to expect to receive what he promised us.

\v 16 For men swear by someone  greater than themselves, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.
\v 17 When God determined to show more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable quality of his purpose, he secured it with an oath.
\v 18  So that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge may have a strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us.
