\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said,
\q
\v 2 Hear diligently my speech;
\q And let this be your consolations.
\q
\v 3 Suffer me, and I also will speak;
\q And after that I have spoken, mock on.
\q
\v 4 As for me, is my complaint to man?
\q And why should I not be impatient?
\q
\v 5 Mark me, and be astonished,
\q And lay your hand upon your mouth.
\q
\v 6 Even when I remember I am troubled,
\q And horror takes hold on my flesh.
\q
\v 7 Wherefore do the wicked live,
\q Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?
\q
\v 8 Their seed is established with them in their sight,
\q And their offspring before their eyes.
\q
\v 9 Their houses are safe from fear,
\q Neither is the rod of God upon them.
\q
\v 10 Their bull gendereth, and fails not;
\q Their cow calveth, and throws not her calf.
\q
\v 11 They send forth their little ones like a flock,
\q And their children dance.
\q
\v 12 They sing to the timbrel and harp,
\q And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.
\q
\v 13 They spend their days in prosperity,
\q And in a moment they go down to Sheol.
\q
\v 14 And they say to God, Depart from us;
\q For we desire not the knowledge of your ways.
\q
\v 15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
\q And what profit should we have, if we pray to him?
\q
\v 16 Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand:
\q The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
\b
\q
\v 17 How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?
\q That their calamity comes upon them?
\q That God distributeth sorrows in his anger?
\q
\v 18 That they are as stubble before the wind,
\q And as chaff that the storm carries away?
\q
\v 19 You say, God lays up his iniquity for his children.
\q Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it:
\q
\v 20 Let his own eyes see his destruction,
\q And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
\q
\v 21 For what careth he for his house after him,
\q When the number of his months is cut off?
\q
\v 22 Shall any teach God knowledge,
\q Seeing he judges those that are high?
\q
\v 23 One dieth in his full strength,
\q Being wholly at ease and quiet:
\q
\v 24 His pails are full of milk,
\q And the marrow of his bones is moistened.
\q
\v 25 And another dieth in bitterness of soul,
\q And never tastes of good.
\q
\v 26 They lie down alike in the dust,
\q And the worm covers them.
\b
\q
\v 27 Behold, I know your thoughts,
\q And the devices wherewith you would wrong me.
\q
\v 28 For you say, Where is the house of the prince?
\q And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?
\q
\v 29 Have you not asked wayfaring men?
\q And do you not know their evidences,
\q
\v 30 That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity?
\q That they are led forth to the day of wrath?
\q
\v 31 Who shall declare his way to his face?
\q And who shall repay him what he has done?
\q
\v 32 Yet shall he be borne to the grave,
\q And men shall keep watch over the tomb.
\q
\v 33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him,
\q And all men shall draw after him,
\q As there were innumerable before him.
\q
\v 34 How then comfort you me in vain,
\q Seeing in your answers there remains only falsehood?
