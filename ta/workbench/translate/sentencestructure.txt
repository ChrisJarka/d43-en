====== Sentence Structure ======

//This answers the question:// //What are the parts of a sentence?//

//In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read://
  * //[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech]]//

===== Description =====

The simplest sentence structure in English includes a  //  **subject**  // and an  //  **action**  // word. // 'The boy ran.'  //

==== Subject ====

The //**subject**// is who or what the sentence is about. In these examples, the subject is underlined: 
  * __The boy__  is running.
  * __He__ is running.

Subjects are typically noun phrases or pronouns. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech]] to learn about nouns and pronouns.) In the examples above, "the boy" is a noun phrase that has the noun 'boy,' and "he" is a pronoun.

When the sentence is a command, it usually does not have a subject pronoun. People understand that the subject is "you." 
  * Close the door.

==== Predicate ====

The predicate is the part of a sentence that tells something about the subject. It usually has a verb. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_verbs]])  In the sentences below, the subjects are "the man" and "he." The predicates are underlined and the verbs are in bold.

  * The man __**is** strong__.
  * He __**worked** hard__.
  * He __**made** a garden__.

====Compound Sentences====

A sentence can be made up of more than one sentence. Each of the two lines below has a subject and a predicate and is a full sentence.
  * He planted the yams.
  * His wife planted the corn.

The compound sentence below has the two sentences above. In English, compound sentences are joined with a conjunction such as "and," "but," or "or".

  * He planted the yams __and__ his wife planted the corn.

==== Clauses ====

Clauses are like sentences because they have a subject and a predicate, but they do not normally occur by themselves. Here are some examples of clauses. The subjects are in bold, and the predicates are underlined.

  * when **the corn** __was ready__
  * after **she** __picked it__
  * because **it** __tasted so good__

Clauses are usually only part of a sentence. The clauses are underlined in the sentences below.
  * __When the corn was ready__, his wife picked it.
  * __After she picked it__, she carried it home and cooked it.
  * Then they ate it all, __because it tasted so good__.

The following phrases can be a whole sentence.

  * His wife picked it.
  * She carried it home and cooked it.
  * Then they ate it all.

Note: We are using the word **clause** for 'dependent clause' and **sentence** for 'independent clause.' 

====Relative Clauses====

In some languages, clauses can be used with a noun that is part of another sentences. These are called **relative clauses**.

In the sentence below, "the corn that he had planted" is part of the predicate of the whole sentence. The relative clause "that he had planted" is used with the noun "corn" to tell which corn she picked.

  * His wife picked **the corn** __that he had planted__.

In the sentence below "his mother, who was very annoyed" is part of the predicate of the whole sentence. The relative clause "who was very annoyed" is used with the noun "mother" to tell how his mother felt.
  * She did not give any corn to **his mother,** __who was very annoyed__.

See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]] to learn about different functions of relative clauses.

====Order of parts of a sentence or clause ==== 

A language may have a preferred word order for its subject, verb, and object or complement. (See: [[wordorder]])

===== Order of clauses and sentences =====

Many sentences in the Bible have more than one clause. And each clause can have phrases in addition to the subject and verb.

A language may have a preferred order for its clauses and other phrases. For example some languages may prefer the order in the first example, while others may prefer the order in the second.

  * She went to the garden to pick some tomatoes.
  * In order to pick some tomatoes, she went to the garden.

A language may have a preferred word order for its subject, verb, and object or complement. (See: [[wordorder]]) For example, English and French normally put the object after the verb. But if the object is a pronoun, French puts it before the verb.

  * English: //The man sees __the house__.//
  * French: //L'homme voit __la maison__. //  (The man sees the house.)
  * English: //The man sees __it__. //
  * French: //L'homme __la__  voit. //  (The man it sees.)

Even within the noun phrase, languages have different word orders. For example, in English, adjectives come before the noun they describe. But in French, adjectives can occur before or after the noun, depending on their type.

  * English: //the __pretty__  flower//
  * French: //la __jolie__  fleur//  (the pretty flower)
  * English:// the __purple__  flower//
  * French:// la fleur __violette__// (The flower violette)

Translators should become aware of the following things in their language: the normal orders of clauses in sentences, the normal order of phrases in clauses, and the normal order of words in phrases. If their language allows variety, translators should learn what each variety is used to communicate.

Translators should became aware of the kinds of clauses their language has and their functions. They should understand the purposes of the clauses in the language they are translating from. When they are translating into their language, they should use the types of clauses and the clause orders that are natural in their own language and that have the same meaning as that of the language they are translating form .

For example, the relative clause in the examples below give added information about the house. Languages that do not use relative clauses and languages that do not use relative clauses for that purpose, will need another way of expressing the information.

 \\ '//After putting the food in the bags, she brought them to her **house**, __which was in the village__//.' \\ '//After putting the food in the bags, she brought them to her house. Her house was in the village.//'

//'Although the boy ran very hard, he couldn't catch the **fox**, __which disappeared into the woods__.'//  \\ //'Although the boy ran very hard, he couldn't catch the fox, because it disappeared into the woods.'//
