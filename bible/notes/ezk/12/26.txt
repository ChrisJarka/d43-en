===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The Word of Yahweh came to me and said **- See how you translated this in 3:16.
  * **Behold**  - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * **The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of far off times****
  * **?**  - This saying of Israel for someone who sees a vision for the future, probably not to be fulfilled in the day of the hearer, and prophesies also for something that will happen in future, perhaps many years after everyone in this century has died.
  * **Thus says the Lord Yahweh**  - See how you translated this in 5:5.
  * **My words will not be delayed any longer, but the word that I have spoken will be done**  - In contrast to the popular saying of Israel in verse 27, God is stating that "my" or "God's" words are going to come to past and not be "delayed", or happen at a later time.
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration**  - See how you translated this in 5:11.
