\v 28 One of the scribes came and heard their discussion, and he saw that Jesus answered them well. He then asked him, "What commandment is the most important?"
\v 29 Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
\v 30 You shall love the Lord your God with all you heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.'
\v 31 The second is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these two."
