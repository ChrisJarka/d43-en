====== Group Process for Creating Translation Notes ======


The way the notes team form and meet varies. However, there are some standard thinks that we would like to happen in every group. 

=== Finish Chapters ===

It is easier for a reviewer to see the flow of thought if they work through a chapter in order. Your notes team may write the notes for chunks in any order they prefer. However, please try to complete all chunks in a chapter whenever possible in order to help the reviewer.


=== Use the Review Checklist ===

Pilots with decades of experience still use checklists before they fly. The steps are important, and the checklist assures they will not forget anything. Our checklist is not as rigid, but we believe it is also important. We suggest that you refer to our checklist long after you think you have the steps down.

Our checklist includes the main topics that cause problems with understanding for mother-tongue translators. You may do the checklist any order (unlike a flight list). The important thing is to cover everything so you do not miss any important things in the verses.

=== Choose Important Terms ===

The first task is to list the "Key Terms" in the "Important Terms" section. These are the terms you believe will be adequately explained in the KT pages, so translation notes might not be necessary. See the links below for guidance:

Is It a KT?


=== Add Translation Notes ===

The entire point of the notes teams is to create the translation notes. We are not interested in the Discussions other than as a record of how the notes were created. A full Discussion without translation notes is of very little value to us. Please focus on writing the notes.

These are __translation notes__. They are not commentary, devotionals, evangelistic materials, etc. Please review all notes carefully to be sure they present all the information a mother-tongue translator (MTT) would need to know in order to accurately translate the verses. However do not include content that is not necessary for translation. Keep it concise and focused. 


=== Discussion Section ===

As stated above, the Discussion section by itself is not valuable. It is important only as a tool to help you create the translation notes. Your use of the Discussion may vary depending on where and when your teams meets. 

  * **Local teams that meet face-to-face** - These teams will use the Discussion section sparingly. It will mainly be a place to leave a record of any important decisions, unanswered questions, outstanding text change requests, or other issues that the reviewer may need to know. 
  * **Mixed teams** - Some teams will regularly meet together, but also do some independent work. IN that case, the team will use the Discussion as above when they meet together. However, when working separately, they can use the Discussion section to leave comments, questions, and suggestions for the other team members
