====== 1 Corinthians 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

Believers should not take another believer to court before an unbelieving judge. It is better to let oneself be cheated. Believers will judge even the angels and should be able to solve problems here on earth. It is especially bad to use a court to cheat another believer. 
People who continue to do evil will not go to heaven. So avoid sinning especially sexual sins, which are sins against the body where the Holy Spirit lives.

[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]: Temple of the Holy Spirit means where the Holy Spirit stays and is worshipped.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

No standing in the church means “not a respected member of the Church”
