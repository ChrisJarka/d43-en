\v 34 Wail, you shepherds, and cry; and wallow in ashes, you principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and
of your dispersions are fully come, and you shall fall like a goodly vessel.

\v 36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal of the flock! for Jehovah lays waste their
