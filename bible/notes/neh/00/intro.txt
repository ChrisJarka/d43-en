**What is Nehemiah about?**\\
Nehemiah’s mission was to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. Nehemiah received a report about the condition of the wall around Jerusalem. In those times, the city wall was essential to the protection of the city against armies and invaders.


**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\ 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Nehemiah" is named for the events of the book which focus on the leadership of Nehemiah. It is likely that the books of Ezra and Nehemiah were originally one book but were separated. One possible title is "The book about Nehemiah."
