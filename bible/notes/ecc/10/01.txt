\v 1 Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor;
so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.
\v 2 A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.
\v 3 Yes also, when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to every one that he is a fool.
