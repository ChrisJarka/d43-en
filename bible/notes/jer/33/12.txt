\v 12 Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and
in all the cities thereof, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
\v 13 In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of
Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him
that numbereth them, says Jehovah.
