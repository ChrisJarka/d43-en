\c 18

\v 1 In that hour came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
\v 2 And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them,
\v 3 and said, Verily I say to you, Except you turn, and become as little children, you shall in no wise enter into the kingdom
of heaven.
\v 4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me:
\v 6 but whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great
millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea.
\p
\v 7 Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! for it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe to that man
through whom the occasion cometh!
\v 8 And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you: it is good for you to enter into
life maimed or halt, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.
\v 9 And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you: it is good for you to enter into life with
one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.
\v 10 See that you despise not one of these little ones: for I say to you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the
face of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 11 \f + Many authorities, some ancient, insert v. 11. \fqa For the Son of man came to save that which was
lost.\f*
\v 12 How think ye? if any man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, does he not leave the ninety and nine, and
go to the mountains, and seek that which goes astray?
\v 13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety and nine which have
not gone astray.
\v 14 Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
\p
\v 15 And if your brother sin against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone: if he hear you, you have gained
your brother.
\v 16 But if he hear you not, take with you one or two more, that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word
may be established.
\v 17 And if he refuse to hear them, tell it to the church: and if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be to you as
the Gentile and the publican.
\v 18 Verily I say to you, What things soever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever you
shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\v 19 Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done
for them of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
\p
\v 21 Then came Peter and said to him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times?
\v 22 Jesus says to him, I say not to thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven.
\v 23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king, who would make a reckoning with his servants.
\v 24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought to him, that owed him ten thousand talents.
\v 25 But forasmuch as he had not wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children,
and all that he had, and payment to be made.
\v 26 The servant therefore fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.
\v 27 And the lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.
\v 28 But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred shillings: and he laid hold on
him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay what you owest.
\v 29 So his fellow-servant fell down and implored him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee.
\v 30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay that which was due.
\v 31 So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were exceeding sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was
done.
\v 32 Then his lord called him to him, and says to him, You wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt, because you
besoughtest me:
\v 33 should not you also have had mercy on your fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on thee?
\v 34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due.
\v 35 So shall also my heavenly Father do to you, if you forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.
