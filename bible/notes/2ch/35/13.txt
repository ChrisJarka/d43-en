\v 13 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in
caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.
\v 14 And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron
were busied in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves,
and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
