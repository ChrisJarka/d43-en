\v 20 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat
stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: believe in Jehovah your God, so shall you be established;
believe his prophets, so shall you prosper.

endures for ever.
