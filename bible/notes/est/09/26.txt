\v 26 So they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of  this letter, and of what  they witnessed and what had happened to them,
\v 27 the Jews established  Purim as binding on themselves, their descendants, and on all who joined their company.  They committed  to observe these two days as was written, at the appointed time  every year.
\v 28 These days were to be remembered and observed in every generation, every family, every province, and every city. These  Jews and their descendants  were to faithfully  observe these days of Purim perpetually.
