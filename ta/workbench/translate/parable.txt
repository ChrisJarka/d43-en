A parable is a story that makes truth easy to understand and hard to forget.

==== Description ====
 
A parable is a story told to teach a truth. Though the events in the parable could happen, they did not actually happen. They are told only to teach a truth. Parables seldom contain the names of specific people (That may be a key for you in identifying what is a parable and what is a narrative account). \\  
(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])


>Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather, on the lampstand, and it shines for everyone in the house. Let your light shine before people in such a way that they see your good deeds and praise your Father who is in heaven. (Matthew 5:15-16 ULB)


==== Examples from the Bible ==== 
>Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather, on the lampstand, and it shines for everyone in the house. Let your light shine before people in such a way that they see your good deeds and praise your Father who is in heaven. (Matthew 5:15-16 ULB)

This parable teaches not hide your living for God from other people.    

>Then he also told them a parable. “Can a blind person guide another blind person? If he did, they would both fall into a pit, would they not? (Luke 6:39 ULB)

This parable teaches that if a person does not have spiritual understanding, he cannot help someone else to understand spiritual things. 


===== Translation Strategies =====

  - If a parable is hard to understand because it has unknown ideas in it, replace the unknown thing with something known in your culture, but be careful to keep the teaching the same. (See: Unknown Ideas)
  - If the teaching of the parable is unclear, consider putting a hint in the quote introducer such as “Jesus told this story about being generous.”
