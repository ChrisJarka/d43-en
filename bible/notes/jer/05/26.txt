<usfm>
\q
\v 26 For wicked men are found with my people – they watch like a trapper crouching;
\q they set a trap and take men!
\q
\v 27 Like a cage full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit!
\q Therefore they grow large and gain riches!
\q 
\v 28 They become fat; they are blubbery –they even pass along the way of wickedness, and do not defend the plea:
\q The plea of the orphan! So they prosper but do not judge the poor with justice!
\q
\v 29 So for these things should I now visit them?—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q Or will my soul not avenge itself in the nation that is like this?
