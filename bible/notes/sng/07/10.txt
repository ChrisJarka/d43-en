===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I am my beloved's** - Translate "My beloved is mine, and I am his" as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:16|2:16]].
  * **my beloved's** - Some versions understand the word "beloved" to refer to the one who loves the woman (see UDB), but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13]].
  * **and he desires me** - "and he wants to make love to me" or "and he wants me"
  * **spend the night in the villages** - Though the words here translated "spend the night" and "villages" appear together in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13-14]] as "spends the night" and "henna flowers," and the context both here and there is lovemaking, the ULB chooses this reading because the immediate metaphor is of the man and woman sleeping in the village, rising in the morning, and going out into the vineyards. The word for "henna plants" and the word for "villages" sound exactly the same.
