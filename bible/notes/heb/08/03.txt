\v 3 Every high priest was appointed  to offer to God gifts and sacrifices for people who sinned. So, since Christ became a high priest, he also had to offer something.
\v 4 Since there are already Jewish priests who offer gifts as God's laws require, if Christ were now living on the earth, he would not be a high priest.
\v 5 The Jewish priests perform rituals which are only a model of what Christ would do in heaven. What God told Moses when Moses was about to set up the Sacred Tent for worshipping him supports the idea that those rituals were only a model. God said, â€œBe sure that you make everything according to the model that I showed you on Sinai Mountain!"

\v 3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.
\v 4 Now if Christ was on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law.
\v 5 They serve that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned by God when he is about to make the tabernacle, "See", he says, "That you make
 everything according to the pattern that was showed to you on Mount Sinai."
