<usfm>
\v 13 But when \add God's people rebuke those evil people about their deeds, it will be clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* how evil their deeds really are, just like\add* everything exposed to the light becomes visible \f + \ft Or:as light ( metaphor ) reveals everything \add that we cannot see in the darkness\add* \f*.
\v 14 \add Just like something on which a light shines reflects that light\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add whoever has learned God's truth reveals that truth to others\add*. That is why \add we believers\add* say this:
\q You who are not aware of your sins, become aware of them \f + \ft metaphor \f*!
\q It is as though you are sound asleep, so wake up!
\q Be like dead people who are becoming alive again!
\q Christ will cause you to know God's truth, just like a light \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\q that shines causes people to know what is in the darkness.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Everything that light exposes can then be clearly seen and better understood
\v 14 because the light shows what it truly is, like  when the light of God's word explains the sins that destroy people and Jesus who forgives and renews people. So believers say, 
\q "Wake up from your sleep 
\q and arise from living like spiritually dead people. 
\q Christ will give you understanding 
\q of his forgiveness and new life."

<usfm>
\v 13 Everything exposed by the light is clearly revealed
\v 14 because the light is shining on it all. Therefore it has been said, "Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
