Q? What was the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the judeans who lived in the land of Egypt?

A. The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh says this: ' You yourselves have seen all the disasters that I brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah. See, they are ruins today; there is no one to live in them. This is because of the wicked things they did to offend me by going to burn incense and to worship other gods. These were gods that neither they themselves, nor you, nor your ancestors knew. So I repeatedly sent all of my servants the prophets to them. I sent them to say, 'Stop doing these abominable things that I hate.' [44:2-4]

Q? What did the judeans do after Jeremiah gave this word of the Lord?

A. They did not listen; they refused to pay attention or turn from their wickedness. [44:5]
