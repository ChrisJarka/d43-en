\v 13 Remember that your desires to sin are the same desires that other people have. But when you are tempted to sin, you can trust God to help you. He will not permit you to be tempted , he will also provide a way for you to endure it without sinning.

\v 11 Now these things happened to them and they were written for our instruction, as examples for us upon whom the end of the ages has come. 
\v 12 Therefore let the one who thinks he stands be careful that he does not fall.
\v 13 No trial of testing has overtaken you except what is common to all people. But God is faithful and he will not let you be tried beyond what you are able to bear, but with the trial he will also provide the way of escape so that you may be able to endure it.
