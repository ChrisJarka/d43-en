===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **crowd-**"large group of people"
  * **nothing that enters into the mouthâ€¦what comes out of the mouth **- Jesus means that food and dietary laws do not condemn a person, but rather their motives and actions.
  * **defiles - **"makes something dirty" (as in "ritually unclean", "sinful", "shameful", or "ruined").
