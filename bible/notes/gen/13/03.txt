===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He continued on his journey**  - or "He traveled by stages."
  * **to the place where his tent had been before - **  this refers to [[:en:bible:notes:gen:12:08|Genesis 12:8]]. It can be made more explicit: "to the place where his tent had been before Abram went to Egypt" (see [[:en:ta:discourse:implicitexplicit]]).
  * **This is the place where the altar was that he had made previously** - The phrase "where the altar was" tells some more information about the place. The phrase "that he had made previously" tells us some more information about the altar. Some languages would need to translate these relative clauses differently: "Abram had made an altar at this place." (See the section on clauses in [[:en:ta:vocabulary:sentencestructure#clause|Sentences]]). 
  * **Abram had called**  - This could alternately be translated as "Abram called." From the text we cannot be certain about whether the text is referring to the first time Abram had called to Yahweh there before leaving or to second time after he returned.
  * **bold words**  - explanation
