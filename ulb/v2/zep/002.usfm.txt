\v 1 Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation that has no shame;
\v 2 before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon
you, before the day of Jehovah’s anger come upon you.
\v 3 Seek you Jehovah, all you meek of the earth, that have kept his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be you
will be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger.
\p
\v 4 For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted
up.
\v 5 Woe to the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan,
the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.
\v 6 And the sea-coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.
\v 7 And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed
their flocks thereupon; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for Jehovah their God will
visit them, and bring back their captivity.
\p
\v 8 I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people,
and magnified themselves against their border.
\v 9 Therefore as I live, says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon
as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey of
them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them.
\v 10 This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah
of hosts.
\v 11 Jehovah will be terrible to them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one
from his place, even all the isles of the nations.
\p
\v 12 You Ethiopians also, you shall be slain by my sword.
\v 13 And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like
the wilderness.
\v 14 And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall
lodge in the capitals thereof; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he
has laid bare the cedar-work.
\v 15 This is the joyous city that lived carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she
become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passes by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.
