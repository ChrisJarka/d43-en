====== Hebrews 04:3-5 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 We who have believed\add in Christ\add* are able to enter the place of resting \add eternally. We know there is a place where we will rest eternally\add* because God said,
\q Because I was angry with them, I solemnly declared, "They will not enter \add the land where\add* I would let them rest."
\p \add God said that\add* even though he ceased his work\add of creating things\add* after he created the world.
\v 4 What someone wrote somewhere \add in the Scriptures\add* about the seventh day\add after he had spent six days creating the world\add*, supports that,
\q Then, on the seventh day, God rested from his work \add of creating everything\add*.
\p
\v 5 But note again what God said about the Israelites\add in the\add* passage that I quoted previously,
\q They will not enter\add the land where\add* I would let them rest.

\v 3 We who have believed in Christ are able to enter the place of rest because God said,
\q "Because I was angry with them, I solemnly declared, 'They will not enter the land where I would let them rest.' "
\p God said this even though his plans for what he would do in creation were complete from the time he created the world.
\v 4 What was written in the Scriptures about the seventh day after he had spent six days creating the world, supports that,
\q "Then, on the seventh day, God rested from his work of creating everything."
\p
\v 5 But note again what God said about the Israelites in the passage that I quoted previously,
\q "They will not enter the land where I would let them rest."

\v 3 For it is we who have believed who will enter into that rest, just as God had  said,
\q "As I swore in my wrath,
\q They shall not enter into my rest."
\p Even though his created works were finished from the beginning of the world.
\v 4 For he has said somewhere concerning the seventh day, 
\q "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works."
\v 5 And again he has said,
\q "They will not enter into my rest."
