\v 5 And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.
\v 6 And he said to his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Jehovah’s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Jehovah’s anointed.
\v 7 So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave,
and went on his way.
