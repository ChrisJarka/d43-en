\v 3 And now he has caused it to happen. He has done just what he said that he would do, because you people sinned against Yahweh and refused to obey him.
\v 4 But today I am going to take the chains off your wrists and release you. If you want to come with me to Babylon, \add that will be fine\add*. I will take care of you. But if you do not want to come with me, do not come. \add Stay here\add*. Look, the entire country is available; you can choose whatever part you want to go to. You can go wherever you wish." \add Then he took the chains off my wrists\add*.

\v 3 and Jehovah has brought it, and done according as he spake: because you have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyoud
his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.
\v 4 And now, behold, I loose you this day from the chains which are upon your hand. If it seem good to you to come with me
into Babylon, come, and I will look well to you; but if it seem ill to you to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold,
all the land is before you; whither it seems good and right to you to go, there go.\
