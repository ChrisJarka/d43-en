===== Doctrinal Errors =====

This section will help the church community understand the commitment of the translators to avoid any doctrinal errors in the translation.

Q? Are you in agreement with the doctrinal statement of the translation guidelines provided for you and its translation process?  (Is the translator committed to follow the statement and guidelines?)

Q? Have you been able to follow the notes of the translation process as accurately as possible, without adding extra information from other sources?  (Is the translator willing and able to be faithful to the message they were to translate?)

Q? Did you find any areas of the translation that seem to contradict the important matters of faith found in your Christian community?  (Was the translator satisfied that the message they translated agreed with the Biblical message of the national language translation?)
