Some languages can use a word or phrase with a noun to give information about that noun or to remind people of something about it.

  * Mary gave some of the food to her sister, __who was very thankful__.
      * The phrase "who was very thankful"[[:en:ta:workbench:translate:immediately-follows-the-word-_ckgedit_quot_sister_ckgedit_quot_-and-informs-us|immediately follows the word "sister" and informs us]]<del>can be used to inform us</del>  about how Mary's sister responded when Mary gave her the food. In this case it does not distinguish this sister from another sister that Mary might have. It simply gives added information about that sister.

===== Description =====

Some languages can use a word or phrase with a noun to give information about that noun or to remind people of something about it.

  * Mary gave some of the food to her sister, __who was very thankful__.
      * The phrase "who was very thankful" [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:immediately-follows-the-word-_ckgedit_quot_sister_ckgedit_quot_-and-informs-us|immediately follows the word "sister" and informs us]]<del>can be used to inform us</del>  about how Mary's sister responded when Mary gave her the food. In this case it does not distinguish this sister from another sister that Mary might have.

=== Reason people use these phrases ===

[[Chris, I added this subsection]]

  * People often present either reminders or new information in a weak way. They do this when they want their listener to give most of his attention to something else they are saying. In the example above, the speaker wants most attention to be given to what Mary did, NOT to how her sister responded.

Reason this is a translation Issue: Languages have different ways of signaling the parts of communication that the listener should pay most attention to.

=== Translation Principles ===

[[Chris, I added this section.]]

  * If your language does not use phrases with a noun for new information or a reminder, you may need to put that information or reminder in a separate sentence.
  * Try to find a way to do this that does not lead the listener to focus on that word or phrase.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>The name of the third river is Tigris, __which flows east of Asshur__. (Genesis 2:14 ULB) \\ There is only one Tigris River. The phrase "which flows east of Ass[[:en:ta:workbench:translate:h|h]]ur" gives more information about where the Tigris River was. [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:this-would-have-been-helpful-to-the-original-audience-because-they-knew-were-asshur-was|This would have been helpful to the original audience, because they knew were Asshur was.]]

>I will wipe away mankind __whom I have created__  from the surface of the earth. (Genesis 6:7 ULB) \\ The phrase "whom I have created" is a reminder of the relationship between God and mankind. [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:it-is-the-reason-god-had-the-right-to-wipe-away-mankind|It is the reason God had the right to wipe away mankind.]]

[[:en:ta:workbench:translate:chris-i-added-the-idol-and-judgment-examples-below|Chris, I added the idol and judgment examples below.]] >I will bring an end to the __worthless__  idols of Memphis. (Ezekiel 30:13 ULB) All idols are worthless. This is why God said he would destroy them.

>for your __righteous__  judgments are good. (Psalm 119:39 ULB) All of God's judgments are righteous. This is why the person who wrote this psalm said that they are good.

==== Translation Strategies ====

If people would understand the purpose of a phrase with a noun, then consider keeping the phrase and the noun together. Otherwise here are other strategies of showing that the phrase is used to inform or remind.

  - Simply put the informing or reminding word or phrase in a separate sentence.
  - If the purpose of that sentence would not be understood, add words that make it clear. [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:chris-i-reworded-this-strategy|Chris, I reworded this strategy.]]

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

[[:en:ta:workbench:translate:chris-i-added-several-examples-and-underlining|Chris, I added several examples and underlining.]]

1. Simply put the informing or reminding word or phrase in a separate sentence.

  * **I hate those who serve __worthless__  idols**  (Psalm 31:6 ULB) - When David said this, his main point was what he thought about people who serve idols. By saying "worthless idols," he was making a commenting about all idols in general. He was not distinguishing worthless idols from valuable idols.  [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:chris-i-changed-this-explanation-and-added-a-ta|Chris, I changed this explanation and added a TA.]]
      * "I hate those who serve idols. Idols are worthless."
      * "I hate those who serve idols. Those things are worthless."

  * **Can Sarah, __who is ninety years old__, bear a son?**  (Genesis 17:17-18 ULB) - The phrase “who is ninety years old” is a reminder of Sarah's age. It tells why Abraham was asking the question. He did not expect that a woman who was that old could bear a child.
      * "Sarah is ninety years old. Can she at bear a son?"

  * **for your __righteous__  judgments are good.**  (Psalm 119:39 ULB)
      * "for your judgments are righteous and good."

2. If the purpose of that sentence would not be understood, add words that make it clear. [[:en:ta:workbench:translate:chris-i-reworded-this-strategy|Chris, I reworded this strategy.]]

  * **I will call on Yahweh, __who is worthy to be praised__** (2 Samuel 22:4 ULB) - There is only one Yahweh. The phrase "who is worthy to be praised" gives a reason for calling on Yahweh. This can be shown with the word "because."
      * "I will call on Yahweh, __because__  he is worthy to be praised"

  * **Can Sarah, __who is ninety years old__, bear a son?**  (Genesis 17:17-18 ULB)
      * "Sarah is ninety years old. Can she at bear a son __when she is that old__?"

  * **for your __righteous__  judgments are good.**  (Psalm 119:39 ULB)
      * "for your judgments are good __because__  they are righteous.
