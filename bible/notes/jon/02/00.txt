====== Jonah 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

As abruptly as chapter one started so chapter two move quickly into poetry from narrative in chapter one. It should be important for the translator to recognize this and make it clear in his translation. Many English translations will indent each of the text to indicate this. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

This chapter contains many terms from the sea. Seaweed is a plant that grows in the sea. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

Poetry often uses metaphors to communicate something with a special meaning. For example, since Jonah was in a fish in the sea, he was trapped and so it reminded him of a prison.  

Jonah is overwhelmed by the depth of the sea and expresses that by speaking about the "base of the mountains" and the "belly of Sheol" 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

Poetry in general can be challenging to translate. Maybe it would be useful to review the training about Hebrew Poetry.
