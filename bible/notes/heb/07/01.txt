\v 1 \add Now I will say more about\add* this \add man\add* Melchizedek. He was the king of Salem \add city and was\add* a priest of God, the one who is greater \add than anyone else\add*. He met Abraham who was returning \add home\add* after \add he and his men\add* had defeated the \add armies of four\add* kings \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. Melchizedek \add asked God to\add* bless Abraham.
\v 2 Then Abraham gave to him one tenth of all \add the spoils he\add* took after winning\add the battle. Melchizedek's name\add* means firstly 'king \add who rules\add* righteously,' and since Salem means 'peace', he was the 'king \add who rules\add* peacefully.'
\v 3 \add In the Scriptures there is\add* no \add record of who his\add* father \add was\add*, nor \add is there any record of who his\add* mother \add was\add*, nor \add is there any record of who his\add* ancestors \add were\add*. There is no \add record of when he was\add* born, nor \add is there any record of when he\add* died. \add For these reasons\add*, \add it is as though\add* he continues to be a priest forever, and for this reason he is like God's Son.

\v 1 Now I will say more about this man Melchizedek. He was the king of Salem city and was a priest of God, who rules the universe. He met Abraham who was returning home after he and his men had defeated the armies of four kings. Melchizedek blessed Abraham.
\v 2 Then Abraham gave to him one tenth of all the spoils he took after winning the battle. Melchizedek's name means firstly "king who rules righteously," and since Salem means "peace," he was the "king who rules peacefully."
\v 3 There is no record that Melchizedek had any human father or mother or ancestors, or that he was ever born or died, but like the Son of God, he remains a priest forever. (Perhaps he was the Son of God, long before he came to earth in Bethlehem?)

\v 1 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
\v 2 has a name which means King of righteousness, and also King of Salem, which is, King of peace. To him Abraham gave a tenth of everything. 
\v 3 He was without father, without mother, without ancestors, without a beginning of days nor end of life, but like the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.
