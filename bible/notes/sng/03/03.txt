  * **watchmen** - men who have the job of keeping guard of the town at night to keep the people safe
  * **as they were making their rounds in the city** - "who were walking around the city on the walls"
  * **him whom my soul loves** - The soul is a metonym for the whole person. Here it makes a stronger statement of the woman's love for the man than "my beloved" ([[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:14]]). See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:03:01|3:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **bedroom** - "the room for sleeping" 
  * **the one who had conceived me** - This is a metonym for her mother. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
