\v 7 \add Moses\add* taught \add the people that if they did not obey God's laws completely they would be\add* separated from God forever. God wrote \add his laws\add* on stone slabs. \add Then he gave them to Moses to teach them to the people. Although God's laws condemned\add* the people to die, \add when Moses brought those laws down from Sinai\add* Mountain\add , God caused Moses' face to shine\add* with radiance \add to show the people that these laws were God's laws\add*. The radiance was \add so bright that\add* the people of Israel could not keep looking at Moses' face. \add They had to look away\add*. But although the radiance \add was bright, it\add* was slowly fading away.
\v 8 \add So\add*, \add since God showed in such a wonderful way that those laws that condemned them to die were from him\add*, surely when we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* teach \add people about how God's\add* Spirit will \add change their lives\add*, \add God will show\add* in an even more wonderful way \add that\add* it is \add his message.\f + \ft Or: will not God show\add* in an even more wonderful way \add that\add* it is \add his message\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 7 But if the ministry that brings people to death was engraved on stone tablets but it shined with such light from God that Moses face shined bright with that light. He had to put on a veil to cover his face to keep the light from shining. The children of Israel could not even look at Moses because of the brightness of his shining face, but that light slowly faded away.
\v 8 So, the ministry of the Spirit must have a brighter light that shone with light of God than even Moses's face did. Moses shining face faded away.

\v 7 But if the ministry of death that was engraved in letters on stones came in such glory that the children of Israel could not look directly at the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face, a glory that was fading,
\v 8 will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?
