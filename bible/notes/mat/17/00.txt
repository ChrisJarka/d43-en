======  Matthew 17 General Notes ======

===Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Bread ==

Jesus liked to use ordinary things to teach people about God. Bread is also a common image throughout  Scripture. In this chapter, Jesus uses the disciple's forgetting of the bread to teach a lesson. The feed of the 5000 reminds the reader of the manna given to Israel in the desert. Leaven is almost universally mentioned as a negative image even though it is important in the production of bread. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Paradox ==

This is a statement that  seems absurd or appears to contradict itself. For example, "whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it" ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:16:24|16:24-28]])
