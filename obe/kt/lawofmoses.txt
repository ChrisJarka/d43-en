====== Law of Moses, Law of the Lord, God's Law, Law ======

===== Definition: =====

The term, "Law of Moses" refers generally to the commandments and instructions that God gave Moses for the people of Israel to obey. Sometimes this is called the "Law of the Lord" or "God's Law" or just "the Law."

  * Sometimes, "the Law" refers only to the Ten Commandments that God wrote on stone tablets for Moses to tell to the Israelites. It can also refer more generally to all of God's instructions and will.
  * Since God gave these laws to Moses, they are sometimes called "the Law(s) of God" and at other times they are called "the Law(s) of Moses." These titles refer to the same writings.
  * The shortest form of the "Law of Moses" is the Ten Commandments. It also refers to the first five books of the Old Testament because Moses wrote them. It sometimes refers to the entire Old Testament.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Since there are many instructions, some translations may prefer to translate this in the plural and say, "Laws."
  * The "Law of Moses" could be translated as "the laws that God told Moses to give to the Israelites".
  * "God's law(s)" can be translated as "the laws that God gave" or "the laws that God commanded."
  * Depending on the context, "The Law of Moses" can also be translated as "the law that Moses wrote" or "the books that Moses wrote" or "the laws that God told Moses to give to the Israelites."
  * The term "the Law" could also be translated as "God's commands" or "everything that God commanded" or "God's rules."
