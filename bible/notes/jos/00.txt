**What is Joshua about?**\\

In the book of Joshua, the promise of entering the Promised Land is fulfilled. When Israel inhabited the land Yahweh gave them, their deliverance from Egypt was complete . In many ways, the book is a continuation of the Pentateuch. There is unity in Israel when the nation set out to meet their enemies. The phrase, “all Israel” went out occurs in many of the battles recorded in the book of Joshua. All the people gathered for instruction. All the people took up the responsibility of punishing those who disobeyed the Law of God. All the people were sent out in battle with all the tribes working together. All the tribes received their portion of the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]] when it was allocated at the end of the conquest of Canaan. 

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
These titles often describe the author or audience of the biblical book. Many books summarize the contents of the book. It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or to follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]). The name “Joshua” means “Yahweh saves.” It is the same name as "Jesus." It is not only a book written by Joshua, but a book about Israel under the leadership of Joshua as well.

**Who wrote Joshua?**\\

The Bible tells us that Joshua composed the book of Joshua. However, there are parts of Joshua, like his death in chapter 24, which Joshua did not write and were added later.


**Did Israel completely conquer the Promised Land?**\\
The books of Joshua and Judges present two very different accounts of the conquest of the Promised Land. Joshua shows Israel easily conquering its enemies through God's power. In Judges, the Israelites struggle to defeat the enemies who remain in the Land of Canaan. Joshua 13:1 shows Israel's failure to obey God and expel the pagan people out of the land.  In the future, their failure to remove the people from the land will cause the people of Israel many problems.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
**Was the conquest of Canaan a religious war?**\\
Joshua gives the rules for a religious or holy war. During the conquest, some people were spared, but in many cases, the army was ordered to kill the people, their livestock, to "utterly destroy" everything in the city. At other times, the city would be plundered and the animals would be taken, but the people would be killed. This unique situation was morally acceptable because God as the king of Israel ordained these actions as punishment for the evil of the Canaanite people.

These battles were carried out as acts of loyalty to God's covenant with Moses. It is the mighty acts of God in repeatedly conquering their enemies which is the center of this account. Even in their failures, Israel defined the ideal of what covenantal obedience should be.

**Who were the twelve tribes in Joshua?**\\
While the twelve tribes are the twelve sons of Jacob, these are not the twelve peoples who receive a portion of the Promised Land. This is because the priests, who are descendants of Jacob's son Levi, did not receive any land.  Instead, Jacob's son Joseph receive two portions of land. These portions were given to Joseph's sons Ephraim and Manasseh. This is why Joseph does not appear to receive an allotment of land.

**Why was it wrong for the people east of the Jordan River to build another altar?**\\
Religiously, it was very important that Israel have a central place of worship. This promoted the unity of Israel centered on the one altar. The unity of Israel plays an important part in the book of Joshua.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**What is the meaning of the phrase "this day"**\\

The time-marker “this day” occurs throughout Joshua. This suggest that there is a period of time between the events of the book and when they were written.  The exact amount of time is debatable.  

**When should Joshua be translated**\\

If the Pentateuch has already been translated, Joshua should be translated before Judges. This is because the overall historical context of Judges will not be understood without the context Joshua provides.
