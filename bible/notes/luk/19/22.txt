\v 22 He said to that servant, 'You wicked servant! I will condemn you by the words you just said. You said that I even take what does not belong to me and harvest what I did not plant.
\v 23 So you should at least have given my money to money lenders! Then when I returned I could have collected that amount plus the interest it would have earned!'
