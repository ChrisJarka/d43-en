\c 4

\v 1 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.
\v 2 And he said to me, What see thou? And I said, I have seen, and, behold, a candlestick all of gold, with its bowl upon
the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top thereof;
\v 3 and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.
\v 4 And I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
\v 5 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said to me, Know you not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
\v 6 Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by
power, but by my Spirit, says Jehovah of hosts.
\v 7 Who are you, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel you shall become
a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, to it.
\v 8 Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 9 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and you shall know that
Jehovah of hosts has sent me to you.
\v 10 For who has despised the day of small things? for these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of
Zerubbabel; these are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
\p
\v 11 Then answered I, and said to him, What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the
left side thereof?
\v 12 And I answered the second time, and said to him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden
spouts, that empty the golden oil out of themselves?
\v 13 And he answered me and said, Know you not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
\v 14 Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
