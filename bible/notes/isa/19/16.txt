In that day, the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the upraised hand of Yahweh of Hosts that he raises over them. The land of Judah will become a cause of staggering to Egypt. Whenever anyone reminds them of her, they will be afraid, because of the plan of Yahweh, that he is planning against them.
