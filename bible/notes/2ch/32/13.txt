\v 13-14 Do you people not know what I and my ancestors have done to all the people-groups in other countries? \add We destroyed them all, and\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* none of the gods of those nations were ever able to prevent my \add troops\add* [IDI] from conquering them! So how can \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* your god prevent my soldiers from conquering \f + \ft metonymy \f* you?
\v 15 So do not allow Hezekiah to deceive you like this. Do not believe what he says, because no god of any nation or kingdom has ever been able to rescue his people from being conquered by my army and the armies of my ancestors. So certainly your god will not be able to rescue you from my power \f + \ft metonymy \f*."

\v 13 Know you not what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?
\v 14 Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
\v 15 Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe you him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
