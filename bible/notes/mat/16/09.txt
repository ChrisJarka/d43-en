\v 10 Or what about the four thousand people who ate when I multiplied the seven small loaves? And how many baskets of scraps did you gather up then?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You**  - This refers to the disciples of Jesus in these verses.
  * **Do you not yet perceive...**
 - This is a rhetorical question used by Jesus to challenge the disciples for forgetting quickly his power. This could be translated as "You quickly forgot what you have seen that I am capable of doing"
  * **Nor the seven loaves... - **  This is another rhetorical question used for the same purpose.
