==== Using translationHelps ====
To help translators make the best translation possible, **translationNotes**, **translationWords**  and **translationQuestions**  have been created.

**translationNotes**  are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain some of the Bible background that the translator needs to know to translate Open Bible Stories, as well as inform translators about different ways that they might express the same meaning.

The **translationWords**  are key terms found in Open Bible Stories and the Bible that are important to translate correctly. Each of these words or phrases has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places where that term is used in either Open Bible Stories or the Bible. This is to show the translator other ways that the translationWord is used and to ensure that it has been translated correctly in those places, too.

The **Comprehension translationQuestions**  can be used to self-check your translation. Can the Target Language translation be used to correctly answer each of the questions? The translationQuestions are also a good tool to use for each level of checking.

Once you have consulted the translationNotes, translationWords and translationQuestions, then you are ready to make the best translation.

**Please use the translationNotes & translationWords when doing your translation!**
