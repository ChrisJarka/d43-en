\v 15 I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return you now every man
from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I
have given to you and to your fathers: but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me.
\v 16 Forasmuch as the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded
them, but this people has not listened to me;
