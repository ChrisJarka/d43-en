====== Romans 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter shifts its audience from Roman Christians, to those who "[[:en:obe:kt:judge|judge]]" and do not [[:en:obe:kt:believe|believe]] in Jesus.

== "Therefore you are without excuse" ==
This phrase looks back at chapter 1 and in some ways, it is actually a conclusion to the argument of chapter 1. This phrase explains the reasons why everyone in the world is required to worship the true God. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Doers of the Law" ==
It is not those who obey the law who will be [[:en:obe:kt:justify|justified]] by their obedience to it. It is those who earnestly try to follow the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]] who are justified by their faith which this demonstrates.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
The are frequently used in this chapter. It appears the intent of these [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|rhetorical questions]] is to make the reader feel [[:en:obe:kt:guilt|guilty]] or to convict them in their [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] and ultimately bring them to [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]] in Jesus.

== Hypothetical Situation ==
In light of the context, "He will give eternal life" is a hypothetical statement. If a person could live a perfect life, they would earn eternal life as a reward. Only Jesus was able to live a perfect life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]]). There is another hypothetical situation in 2:17-29. This situation explains that even those who earnestly try to obey the Law of Moses are guilty of violating the law. In English, this is about those who follow the "letter" of the law but cannot follow the "spirit" or general principles of the law.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "You who judge" ==
At times, this could be translated in a simpler way, but it is translated in this relatively awkward way because Paul is reference "people who judge" in such a way as to also say that everyone judged. It is possible to translate this as, "those who judge (and everyone judges)."
