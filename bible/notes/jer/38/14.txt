\v 14 Next King Zedekiah sent out and took Jeremiah the prophet to himself, to the third entrance that was in the house of Yahweh, and the king said to Jeremiah, “I am asking you 
for a word. Do not conceal the word from me.”
\v 15 And Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I report to you will you not certainly kill me? And if I council you, you will not listen to me.”
\v 16 But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in secret and said, “As Yahweh who made us with this soul lives, I will not kill you or give you into the hand of these men who are seeking your life.”
