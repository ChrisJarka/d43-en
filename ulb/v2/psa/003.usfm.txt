\c 3
\d A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
\b
\q
\v 1 Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased!
\q Many are they that rise up against me.
\q
\v 2 Many there are that say of my soul,
\q There is no help for him in God. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 3 But thou, O Jehovah, are a shield about me;
\q My glory, and the lifter up of my head.
\q
\v 4 I cry to Jehovah with my voice,
\q And he answereth me out of his holy hill. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 I laid me down and slept;
\q I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me.
\q
\v 6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people
\q That have set themselves against me round about.
\q
\v 7 Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God:
\q For you have struck all mine enemies upon the cheek bone;
\q You have broken the teeth of the wicked.
\q
\v 8 Salvation belongs to Jehovah:
\q Your blessing be upon your people. \qs [Selah\qs*
