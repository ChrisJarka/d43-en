SUMMARY: Direct and indirect quotations in the Bible need to be translated and punctuated correctly.

In English, speech can be expressed by direct or indirect ( non-direct) quotations.

  * **Direct**  quotations are ones where someone reports someone else’s speech exactly the way it was said.
  * Example: “John said, ‘I do not know what time I will arrive,’” Mary told me.

Direct quotations are written between double quote marks (“ ”), or between single quote marks (‘ ’) where a quote is within another quote.

  * **Indirect** **(****non-direct)**  quotations are ones where a speaker only reports what was said.
  * Example: John said __he__  did not know what time __he__  would arrive, Mary told me.

The pronouns change from the original and often the verb tense, too. Indirect quotations are written without quote marks.
===== Examples from the Bible =====

This verse has both an indirect quote and a direct quote:

**He instructed him to tell no one, but told him, ****“****Go on your way, and show yourself to the priest and offer a sacrifice for your cleansing, according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.****”** (Luke 5:14 ULB)
   * **He instructed him to tell no one,**  is an indirect quote.
  * **but told him, “Go on your way, and show yourself to the priest…”**  is a direct quote.
Luke 17:20-21 is another example of both an indirect and a direct quote:

**Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus answered them and said, ****“****The kingdom of God is not something that can be observed. ****21 ****Neither will they say, 'Look here!' or, 'Look there!' because the kingdom of God is among you.****”**  (Luke 17:20-21 ULB)
  * **Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come****,**  is an indirect quote.
  * **Jesus answered them and said, “The kingdom of God is not something that can be observed. ****21 ****Neither will they say, 'Look here!' or, 'Look there!' because the kingdom of God is among you.****”**  This is a direct quote, enclosed by double quotes, from **“The kingdom**  to **among you.****”**  Verse 21 also has two direct quotes within the longer quote, **'Look here!' **  and** 'Look there!' **  which are enclosed by //single //  quotes.

===== Translation Strategies =====

Some languages have more than one way to show **in****direct ** quotations. If that is true of your language, choose the best one. **D****irect** quotes in the source text should be translated as direct quotes in the target text. Reorganize the sentence, if needed, to be sure to keep **direct** quotes.

Some languages require special markers that show how a speaker received his information. These can range from being a witness, to being directly told (quoted speech), to being indirectly told (reported speech), to hearsay, to inference.

Before you start this module have you learned about:

Watch the video for the [[http://youtu.be/oe9Pbk8pFTw|computer]] (http://youtu.be/oe9Pbk8pFTw) or the [[http://youtu.be/9ZKDMCWuCiw|tablet/phone]] (http://youtu.be/9ZKDMCWuCiw).
In English there are direct and non-direct (indirect) quotations.
  * **DIRECT**  quotations are when someone reports someone else’s speech the way the other person would have said it. (She said, “Come.” and then he said, “I will come.”) Direct quotations are written between quote marks “ ”.
  * **INDIRECT**  or **NON-DIRECT**  quotations are when someone reports basically what another person said but from his own perspective (his own words). (She told him to come. He said he would come.) The pronouns change, and often there is a change in the verb tense. Indirect quotations are written without quote marks “ ”.
===== Translation Suggestions =====
Some languages have more than one kind of **NON-DIRECT ** quotations. If that is true of your language, consider the best non-direct quotation you should use.  Remember that **DIRECT** quotes in the source text should be direct quotes in the translated text. Perhaps your language organizes the sentence differently, you should then organize the sentence to keep the direct quote.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
Luke 5:14 has an example of an indirect quote and a direct quote in the same verse:
  * //He instructed him to tell no one// is an indirect quote.
  * //He told him, "Go on your way, and show yourself to the priest."//is a direct quote.
Luke 17:20 is another example where there is an indirect quote and a direct quote in the same verse:
  * //"Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come"//is an indirect quote.
  * //Jesus answered them and said, "The kingdom of God is not something that can be observed."//This// //is a direct quote.
===== Examples from English =====
//**Direct Quotations** //
  * John said, “I am reading a book.”
“I am reading a book” is a direct quotation, as it is the words John spoke. The word “I” refers to John, not to the person reporting what John said.
//**Indirect Quotations** //
  * John said that he was reading a book.
The phrase “that he was reading a book” is an indirect quotation as someone else is reporting what another person said.
===== Examples from other languages =====

Some languages require special markers that indicate what evidence a speaker has for what they are saying. These can range from being a witness, to being directly told (quoted speech), to being indirectly told (reported speech), to heresay, or inference.

From Lezgian, a language spoken in Azerbaijan and Russia

Qe sobranie že-da-**lda**

today meeting be-fut-**quot**

**'They say** that there will be a meeting today'

The marker -lda announces that this is reported speech.
