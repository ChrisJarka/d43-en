\v 4 They wanted God to erase the record of their sins  \add as a result of their obeying his laws. But\add* because of what Christ has done, it is no longer necessary for  \add people to obey\add* the laws  \add God gave Moses in order for the record of their sins to be erased\add*. Now God will erase the record of sins of everyone who trusts  \add in what Christ has done\add*.


\p
\v 5 In regard to  \add the old\add* way, Moses wrote  \add concerning people who obey God's\add* laws, "It is the people who have done  \add perfectly\add* the things  \add that the laws require\add* who will gain  \add eternal\add* life by  \add doing\add* them."

\v 4 Christ has perfectly obeyed the law in order to put everyone who believes in him right with God. So the law is no longer necessary for us.



\p
\v 5 Moses wrote about people who tried to obey all of God's laws: "It is the people who have done perfectly the things that the law requires who will live forever."

\v 4 For Christ is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness for everyone who believes.
\v 5 For Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from the law: "The man who does the righteousness of the law will live by this righteousness."
