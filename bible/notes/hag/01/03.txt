\v 3 And so the word of Yahweh came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, and said,
\v 4 "Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your finished houses, while this house lies waste?
\v 5 So now thus says Yahweh of Hosts, 'Consider your ways!
\v 6 You have sown much, and bring in little; you eat and do not have enough and you drink but cannot get drunk. 
You wear clothes but cannot warm yourselves, and the wage-earner earns money to put in a bag with holes!'
