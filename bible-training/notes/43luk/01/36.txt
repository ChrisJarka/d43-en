===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **your relative** - If you need to state a specific relationship, Elizabeth was probably Mary's aunt, or great-aunt.
  * **Nothing is impossible for God!** - This can also be translated as “For God can do anything!” or "because God can do anything." What God had done for Elizabeth was proof that God was able to do anything, and that he could even enable Mary to become pregnant without her having sexual relations.
  * **may what you have said** - This can also be translated as “Let what you have said”. Mary was expressing her willingness for these things to happen.
  * **come true** - That is, “happen” or, “be.”
