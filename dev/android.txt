__Notes:__

**OLD SETUP:**

Every Android project contains several folders:
  * src: 
    * This folder contains the Java source files
  * gen: 
    * Generated Java library
    * this library is for Android internal use only
  * res: 
    * stores resource files such as pictures
    * XML files for defining layouts, and so forth
    * Within this folder there are additional folders such as Drawable, Layout, and Values.
      * drawable: 
        * stores the various graphic files
        * stores drawable folders for many Android devices with different screen resolutions
        * By default, there are several versions of this folder such as: Drawable-mdpi, drawable-hdpi, and so forth 
        * required to adapt to different screen resolutions
      * layout:
        * for XML layout files
        * XML layout files define how various Android objects (such as textboxes, buttons, etc.) are organized on screen.
      * values:
        * XML files which store various string values (titles, labels, etc.)
