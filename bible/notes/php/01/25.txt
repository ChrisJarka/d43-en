\v 25 I know with confidence that I shall remain, yes, and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith.
\v 26 It is so that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus for me when I am with you again.
\v 27 Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ so that, whether I come and see you or I am absent, I may hear good things about you.  May I hear that you stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel.
