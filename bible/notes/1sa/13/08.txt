\v 8 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
\v 9 And Saul said, Bring hither the burnt offering to me, and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.
\v 10 And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul
went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
