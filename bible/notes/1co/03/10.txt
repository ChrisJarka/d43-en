\v 10 Just like a skilled person puts a foundation in the ground before he builds a house, as a result of God kindly helping me , each person who teaches God's truth must be careful about what he teaches.
\v 11 Just like people can put in only one foundation for a house , there is only one message that we can give to people. That message is about Jesus Christ.

\v 10 According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another builds on it. But let each man take heed how he builds on it.
\v 11 For no other foundation can a man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
