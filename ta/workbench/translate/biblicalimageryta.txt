==== Description ==== 

Biblical imagery uses ideas to represent other ideas. For example one image in the Bible involves the idea of MASTER. The idea of MASTER represents anything that motivates someone to act. In Matthew 6:24 below, God and wealth are represented as masters because both can motivate people to act. A person can serve God by doing what God motivates him to do, or he can "serve" wealth by doing what wealth motivates him to do. In this example, the idea of MASTER is stated explicitly with the words "serve" and "masters".

>No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. (Matthew 6:24 ULB)

Very often, a key idea is only implied in a passage; it might not be stated explicitly. For example, in Isaiah 55:11, the idea of MASTER is implied by what God says about his word. Just as masters send their servants to do things and their servants do what they want and then return to their masters, God "sends out" his word by speaking it and it does what he wants. \\ 

>so also my word will be that goes from my mouth: it will not return to me uselessly, but it will accomplish that which I wish, and it will succeed in that for which I sent it. (Isaiah 55:11 ULB)


==== Patterns of Associations ====

Most **metaphors** in the Bible fall into broad patterns of associations between ideas. These patterns are often unique to the Hebrew and Greek languages. It is useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems on how to translate them. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere.

See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part1]] for links to pages showing common patterns of associations between ideas in metaphors and similes.

==== Common Metonymies ====

In metonymy, a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. 
See [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part2]] for a list of some common metonymies in the Bible.


==== Cultural Models ====
Cultural models can be described as systems of thought about things or experiences. These systems of thought are more elaborate and more developed than metaphorical patterns and metonymies. Some of these cultural models were used extensively in the Ancient Near East, and not only among the Israelites. See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimageryta_part3]] for a lists of cultural models in the Bible.
