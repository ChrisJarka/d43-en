\v 6 So that we had to ask Titus, that as he had already made a beginning, so he would also complete this act of grace among you.
\v 7 But as you excel in everything, in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, make sure that you excel in this gracious work also.
