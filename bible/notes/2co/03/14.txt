\v 14 But the Israelites stubbornly refused to \add understand that the old agreement would end\add*. Even now, when they read the old agreement, \add they still do not realize that it has ended. It is as if\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* that same veil \add that Moses put on his face\add* is now over their \add minds, keeping them from understanding God's true message\add*. They will \add understand that message\add* only when \add they come to trust\add* in Christ. Then \add it will be as though God\add* has removed the veil.
\v 15 \add Throughout all these years\add*, even until now, when \add the Israelites\add* read what Moses \add write, it is as though\add* a veil is covering their minds.
\v 16 But when any of them believes in the Lord \add Jesus\add*, \add God\add* removes that veil from them.

\v 14 Long ago, the children of Israel closed their minds to God's message. Even today when the old testament law is read, the same veil that covered Moses' face, they wear the same veil. Only when we are joined with Christ does God take the veil away; and only then can we hear the message and see Christ as God shines that light from God on him, that is the light that never fades away.
\v 15 But even today, whenever the law of Moses is read, a veil remains over their hearts.
\v 16 But when a person turns to the Lord, the veil is removed so they will see the light from God.
