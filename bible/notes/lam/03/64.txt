===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Pay back to them, Yahweh, according to what they have done** - Here "Pay back to them" represents punishing them. What they have done can be stated clearly. AT: "Punish them, Yahweh, according to what they have done" or "Yahweh, they have made me suffer, so please make them suffer" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **You will let their hearts be shameless** - Here the "heart" is a metonym that represents their attitudes and emotions, and being "shameless" means not feeling ashamed of their sins even though they should. Their not being ashamed would give even more reason for God to punish them. AT: "You will let them feel no shame for their sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **May your condemnation be upon them** - The abstract noun "condemnation" can be expressed with the verbs "condemn" or "curse." AT: "Condemn them" or "Curse them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **from under the heavens** - Here "from under the heavens" represents everywhere on earth. AT: "wherever they are on earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
