\v 7 Similarly, the people who lived \f + \ft metonymy \f* in Sodom and Gomorrah \add cities\add* and the nearby cities committed sexual immorality.

\v 8 Similarly, these \add ungodly people in your midst\add* also defile their own bodies \add by living immorally\add*, because \add they claim\f + \ft Or: say \f* that God revealed\add* in visions \add that they should act that way\add*.

\v 7 Similarly, the people who lived  in Sodom and Gomorrah cities and the nearby cities committed sexual immorality. They sought all kinds of sexual relations that differ from what God permits. So God destroyed their cities. What happened to those people and those angels in heaven shows that God will punish people, such as the ones who teach false doctrine, in the eternal fire of hell.
\v 8 Similarly, these ungodly people in your midst also defile their own bodies by living immorally. They say that God has sent them visions that tell them to live like this. But they do not obey God's commands, and they insult his wonderful angels.

\v 7 It is just like Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, which in a similar way gave themselves over to fornication and oursued unnatural desires. They were given as examples of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.
\v 8 Yet in the same way these also pollute their bodies in their dreams, and they reject  authority, and they say evil things about the glorious ones.
