===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Because of the words "Jeremiah's words end here" in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:51:63|51:64]] and because the words here appear in other books of the Bible, many scholars believe that this chapter was written by someone other than Jeremiah and attached b.

  * **Hamutal** - This is the name of a woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Libnah** - This is the name of a place. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Jeremiah** - This refers to another man named Jeremiah, not the prophet Jeremiah who wrote this book. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh** - The nominal adjective "evil" can be translated as a relative clause "things that were evil." Here Yahweh's "sight" refers to how he judges or decides on the value of something. AT: "He did things that Yahweh said were evil" or "He did the things that Yahweh considers evil" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_nominaladj]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
