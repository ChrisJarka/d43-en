\c 122
\d A Song of Ascents; of David.
\q
\v 1 I was glad when they said to me,
\q Let us go to the house of Jehovah.
\q
\v 2 Our feet are standing
\q Within your gates, O Jerusalem,
\q
\v 3 Jerusalem, that are builded
\q As a city that is compact together;
\q
\v 4 Whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of Jehovah,
\q For an ordinance for Israel,
\q To give thanks to the name of Jehovah.
\q
\v 5 For there are set thrones for judgment,
\q The thrones of the house of David.
\q
\v 6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
\q They shall prosper that love thee.
\q
\v 7 Peace be within your walls,
\q And prosperity within your palaces.
\q
\v 8 For my brethren and companionsâ€™ sakes,
\q I will now say, Peace be within thee.
\q
\v 9 For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God
\q I will seek your good.
