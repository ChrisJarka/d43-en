\v 25 Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy,
and terror, are on every side.
\v 26 O daughter of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow yourself in ashes: make you mourning, as for an only son,
most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.
