\v 1 Afterward Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his place.
\v 2  David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent envoys to console him concerning his father. But when Davidâ€™s servants entered the land of the Ammonites to Hanun, to
console him, \v 3 the princes of Ammon said to Hanun, "Do you really think that David honors your father and has sent comforters to you? Don't his servants come to you to explore and spy out the land, to overthrow it."
