\v 14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
\v 15 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen,
to sacrifice to Jehovah your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
\v 16 Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what Jehovah has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.
