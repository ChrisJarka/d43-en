\q
\v 3 So the spring rains were withheld and the late rains did not come;
\q But the brow of the whorish woman was yours; you refused to feel shame.
\q
\v 4 Will you not call out to me from this time on, “My father! You are my closest friend from my youth!”
\q
\v 5 Will he be angry forever? Or always keep his anger?
\q Behold! You have declared and done evil, and continued them!’”
