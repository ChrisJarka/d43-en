===== Important Terms: =====

  * bread
  * yeast
  * Pharisees
  * Sadducees

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You**  - "you" refers to the disciples of Jesus.
  * **How is it that you do not understand …**  - This is a rhetorical question.  This could be translated "You should have understood that I was not really speaking about bread" (UDB)
  * **the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees**  - This is a metaphor. It can be translated as “the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and Sadducees, which is like yeast.” Just as yeast spreads through a whole lump of bread dough, their hypocrisy was spreading through the whole community.
