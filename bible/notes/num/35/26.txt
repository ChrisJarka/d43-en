\v 26 But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth,
\v 27 and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the mankiller; he shall not be guilty of blood,
\v 28 because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.
