\v 18 Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by: and you shall gather to you into the house your father, and your mother, and your brethren, and all your fatherâ€™s household.
\v 19 And it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless: and whoever shall be with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
