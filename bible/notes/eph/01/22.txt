  * **subjected **– This can be translated as “put”. (See UDB)​
  * **feet **– The word “feet” is a metonymy for authority or power, so God has put all things under Christ’s power. (See: metonymy)
  * **head over all things in the Church, which is his body**  - This is a metaphor for the church, where Christ is to the church what the head is to a body, and people belonging to a church are like the parts of a human body. (See: metaphor and See:UDB)
