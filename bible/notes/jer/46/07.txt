\v 7 Who is this who rises like the Nile, whose waters toss up and down like the rivers?

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah continues quoting Yahweh's declaration to the nation of Egypt.
 
  * **Who is this who rises like the Nile ... the rivers?** - Yahweh uses a question to draw attention to what he is about to say concerning Egypt. AT: "Look at who rises like the Nile ... the rivers." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Egypt rises like the Nile** - The Nile river floods its banks once a year, covering the surrounding area with water. Yahweh compares the Egyptian army to the Nile because the Egyptians think they are mighty enough to destroy cities in all the land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Egypt rises ... I will** - Here "Egypt" represents the army. AT: "The Egyptian army rises" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **It says** - Here "It" refers to Egypt which represents the army. AT: "The soldiers say ... We will" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Go up, horses. Be angry, you chariots.â€‹** - Yahweh commands the horses and chariots as if they were people. Both the words "horses" and "chariots" are referring to parts of chariots in battle. These phrases are commanding the chariot drivers to charge into battle. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Cush ... Put ... Ludim** - These are biblical names for the countries of Ethiopia, Libya, and Lydia. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
