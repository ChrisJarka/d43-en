===== The Process =====

//This page answers the question:// //What is the process for recording?//

In the most simple terms, this is the process:

  - The recordist presses the RECORD button in the software or on the device.
  - The narrator speaks a section of content into the mic.
  - The recordist presses the STOP button or similar function in the software or device.
  - The recordist plays the recorded section for the Checker and Narrator to review.
  - Depending on the decision of the Checker, the team may edit that recorded passage or they may begin recording the next section.

This process repeats over and over throughout a project. There are more aspects to editing and giving final review that are not mentioned above, but when considering the step of recording, it is a simple process.

Wise recordists quickly adopt the approach of “recording with editing in mind”. That is, recordists soon discover that recording is only the first part of a bigger process. The full process is made easier (or more difficult) because of decisions made during the recording step. In a sense, recording is capturing the sounds. But those sounds must come together into a meaningful, accurate piece of art, which requires editing. If you want editing to go well, do what wise recordists do and “record with editing in mind”.
