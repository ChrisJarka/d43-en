  * **no sin offering must be eaten** - "no one may eat the sin offerings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **from which any blood is brought into the tent of meeting** - Yahweh commanded the priests not to eat any meat that had it's blood offered in the holy place. Translate this so it is clear that it is the blood which the priests take into the holy place. AT: "from which the priest takes the blood into the tent of meeting" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
