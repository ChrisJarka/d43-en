\v 6 Since it is because he acts kindly \add toward those whom he chooses, it is\add* not because they have done good things \add that he has chosen them\add*. If \add God chose people because they did good deeds\add*, then it would not be because he was acting toward them in a way that they did not deserve.


\p
\v 7 \add Since God chose only some people of Israel\add*, \add this is what I conclude:\f + \ft Or: what shall we conclude\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Most of the people of\add* Israel did not find \add the way for him to erase the record of their sins\add*, even though some of them were earnestly looking for it. The \add people of Israel whom God had\add* chosen found it, but the rest \add of them\add* were \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* \f* made spiritually insensitive, Or: unresponsive.
\v 8 \add Our\add* fellow Jews are just like the \add ones\add* about whom Isaiah wrote,
\q God caused their senses to be dull\f + \ft Or: made them unable to think clearly \f*. Up to this very day\add , they have\add* eyes but they cannot see \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add They have\add* ears, but they cannot understand \add spiritually\add*.

\v 6 Since it is because he acts kindly toward those whom he chooses, it is not because they have done good things that he has chosen them. If God chose people because they did good deeds, then it would not be because he was acting toward them in a way that they did not deserve.

\v 7 Since God chose only some people of Israel, this is what I conclude: made spiritually insensitive, Or: unresponsive.
\v 8 Our fellow Jews are just like the ones about whom Isaiah wrote,
\q God caused their senses to be dull. They have ears, but they cannot understand spiritually.

\v 6 But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works. Otherwise grace is no longer grace.
\v 7 What then? That for which Israel seeks, that it did not obtain, but the chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened.
\v 8 Just as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of dullness, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day."
