====== Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural ======

Some languages, like English, have only one word for ‘you’ regardless of how many people are being spoken to. English speakers can refer to one person as ‘you’ or to many people as ‘you’. Often the context will make it clear as to whether the word ‘you’ refers to one person or more than one.  Looking at the other pronouns in the sentence will help you distinguish the audience.

Some languages have more than one word for ‘you’ depending on how many people are being spoken to. If they are speaking to one person, they use the ‘singular’ form of ‘you’. If they are speaking to more than one person, they use the ‘plural’ form of ‘you.’ Some languages have a ‘dual’ form for speaking to two people and some have other forms for speaking to three or four people.

The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. These languages both have a singular form of you and a plural form of you. When reading the Bible in a language that does not have distinct singular and plural forms of ‘you’, the context will often make it clear whether the word “you” is intended to refer to one person, to two people, or to more than two people.



===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Note that for many languages, the decision about what form of the pronoun to use will also affect the form of the verb associated with it, even in cases where the word “you” is not expressed (for example when a command is given).

===== Examples from the Bible - Dual =====

Here are some examples from the Bible where the word ‘you’ refers to two people. Languages that have a **D****ual**  form for the word ‘you’ would use the dual form in these verses.

  * Mark 10:35-36 //And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And [Jesus] said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”//

Jesus is asking the **two**, James and John, what they want him to do for them.

  * Mark 11:1-2 //…Jesus sent two of his disciples, saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.//

The context makes it clear that Jesus is addressing two persons, so the dual form of “you” would be used here in languages that make that distinction. Here the verbs “go” and “untie” would need the dual form of “you”.

===== Examples from the Bible - Instructional Text =====

In instructional text, the “you” is often **Plural**  since it is addressing a wide audience. Here is an example:

  * 1 Peter 1:17 //Since you call on a Father who judges each man’s work impartially, live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear.//

However, sometimes the instruction is addressed to one person, so the singular form of “you“ would be used. The context will make that clear. This often happens in a letter. For example:

  * Titus 1:2,5; 2:1 //To Titus, my true son in our common faith…The reason I left you in Crete was that you might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you….You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine.”//
  * Also 1 Timothy 1:28 is an example of instruction that is addressed to one person. //Timothy, my son, I give you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by following them you may fight the good fight.//

Sometimes instructional text can be either Singular or Plural, especially when a general principle is being taught.

In the following passages, when Jesus spoke to a group of people he taught general principles that apply to individual people, so the “you” or “your” could be singular. Try it both ways and choose what sounds most natural in your language. Let us look at a couple of examples.

  * Luke 11:34 //Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body also is full of darkness.//

Some languages that distinguish between singular and plural forms of you would use the singular form because each person has his own eyes and body and does not share his eyes and bodies with others. But other languages might use the plural form of ‘you’ because Jesus was speaking to more than one person.

  * Luke 6:21 //Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.//

This could be translated, “Blessed are each of you…” or “Blessed are all of you…” Either one would be the correct meaning.
