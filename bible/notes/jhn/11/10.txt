===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **"However, if he walks at night, he will stumble because the light is not in him."**  - Jesus makes this statement as a contrast to the statement made in [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:11:08|11:9]]. He uses this word picture to teach the disciples that without the spiritual light of Jesus they will stumble (or 'falter') in their relationship with God. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **"Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, **- Jesus is telling his disciples that Lazurus is dead, but that it is only for a short time. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonym]]).
  * **but I am going so that I may wake him out of sleep.‚Äù**- Jesus is revealing his plan to resurrect Lazurus. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonym]]).
