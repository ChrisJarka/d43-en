====== uW Technical Teams Overview ======

The unfoldingWord technical initiatives are broken down into various projects.  Each of these projects is run by a Core Team of people who have specific roles within that project.  Every Core Team is also a part of an Extended Team that primarily provides feedback to the Core Team.

===== Core Team =====

The Core Team is the essential working unit, the group that drives progress on the project.  It is essential that this unit's communication cycle is measured in hours or days at worst.

Core Team Roles:

^  Accountability  ^  Responsibility  ^  Authority  ^
| Tracker: single person who ensures communication and progress occur | Implementer: group that does the majority of the work to make it happen | Decision Maker: group that makes the high level decisions |

Each of these people or teams must work together to make the project move forward.  Though each has a unique role, the relationship between the three is reciprocal.

Note that that the Authority role is roughly analogous to the Product Owner in Scrum.

===== Extended Team =====

The Extended Team is the essential feedback unit, the group that drives iteration in the Core Team.  It is essential that this unit's communication cycle with the Core Team be measured in days or weeks at worst.

Extended Team Roles:

^  Core Team  ^  Consultants  ^  Users  ^
| Person from Core Team acting as accountability role for the Extended Team | Group of specialists that provides feedback to the Core Team | Group of users providing feedback |

An individual from the Core Team is designated to ensure communication is flowing between the Extended Team and Core Team. The Users role in Extended Team can be quite large, so an effective strategy for communication between them and the Core Team is essential.  The Consultants will often have direct involvement with the Core Team, occasionally becoming honorary members of the Core Team.

Graphically, the teams look like this:
