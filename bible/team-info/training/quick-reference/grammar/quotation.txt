====== Speech Quotations ======


===== Description =====

In English there are direct and non-direct (indirect) quotations.

  * **DIRECT**  quotations are when someone reports someone else’s speech the way the other person would have said it. (She said, “Come.” and then he said, “I will come.”) Direct quotations are written between quote marks “ ”.
  * **INDIRECT**  or **NON-DIRECT**  quotations are when someone reports basically what another person said but from his own perspective (his own words). (She told him to come. He said he would come.) The pronouns change, and often there is a change in the verb tense. Indirect quotations are written without quote marks (“ ”).
