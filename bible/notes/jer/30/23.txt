===== translationNotes: =====

  * **See, the tempest of Yahweh, his fury, has gone out** - This speaks of God's anger and punishment as if it were a storm. This emphasizes his power and ability to destroy wicked people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his heart's intentions** - The abstract noun "intentions" can be translated using the verb "intends." The heart is a synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "what he intends to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
