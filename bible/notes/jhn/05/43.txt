====== John 05:43-44 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 43 Although I have come to earth with my Father's authority \f + \ft metonymy \f*, you do not accept me. But if someone else comes with his own authority \f + \ft metonymy \f*, you accept him!
\v 44 You accept your praising each other, but you do not try to do things that will result in God himself praising you. So there is no way you can believe \add in me\add*!\f + \ft Or: how can you believe \add my message\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 43 I have come with my Father's authority, but still you do not welcome me or trust me. If someone else came with his own authority, you would listen to him.
\v 44 How can you trust in me when you work so hard for others among yourselves to honor you? Yet all the while, you refuse to seek the true honor that comes from the one and only God.

\p

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 43 I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me.  If another should come in his own name, you would receive him.
\v 44 How can you believe, you who accept praise from one another but are not seeking the praise that comes from the only God?
