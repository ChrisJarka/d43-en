====== Yahweh of hosts, God of hosts, host ======

===== Definition: =====

The terms "Yahweh of hosts" and "God of hosts" are titles that express God's authority over the thousands of angels who obey him.

  * The term "host" or "hosts" is a word that refers to a large number of something, such as an army of people or the massive number of stars.
  * Older English versions of the Bible use the term "hosts" to refer to angels, armies, and stars.
  * The phrase "host of heaven" refers to all the stars, planets and other heavenly bodies.
  * In some modern churches the name "Yahweh" is not used and is replaced with "LORD" in all capital letters as a sign of reverence to God. So the phrase would then be "LORD of hosts."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Ways to translate the title "Yahweh of hosts" or "God of hosts" could include, "Yahweh, who rules all the angels" or "God, the ruler over armies of angels."
  * The term "host" could also be translated as "army" or "large number."
