    * **He has helped**  - That is, "The Lord has helped." 
    * **his servant Israel**  - "Israel" here refers to the nation, or people, of Israel. If readers confuse this with the the man named Israel, it may help to translate it as, "his servant, the nation of Israel" or, "Israel, his servants." 
    * **just as he promised**  - This could also be translated here as, "because he promised."
    * **his descendants**  - That is, "Abraham's descendants."
