\v 29 Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,
and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.
\v 30 And Jephthah vowed a vow to Jehovah, and said, If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
\v 31 then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the
children of Ammon, it shall be Jehovahâ€™s, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.
