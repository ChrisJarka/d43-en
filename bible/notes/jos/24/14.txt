\v 14 "Now be afraid, and be in awe of Yahweh. Serve him with and be full of the truth and very be faithful when you make promises to Yahweh. Throw away the idols your ancestors worshiped when they lived on the far side of the Euphrates River, and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh.
\v 15 If you cannot bring yourselves to worship Yahweh, make your choice known. This day, you should choose who you will serve. You must decide whether you will serve the gods of your ancestors when they lived on the other side of the Euphrates River served, or if you will serve the gods of the Amorites, who were known in this land where you now live. But as for me and my family, we will serve Yahweh"

\v 14 â€œNow fear Yahweh, and serve him with all integrity and faithfulness; and get rid of the gods that your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh.
\v 15 If it evil in your eyes for you to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live. But as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh."
