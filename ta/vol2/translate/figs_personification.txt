===== Personification =====

This module answers the question: What is personification?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]]

Personification is a figure of speech in which the speaker or writer gives human characteristics to non-human objects, that is, things or ideas.  Personification helps a writer to describe something in a more vivid or life-like way. It adds depth to writing and helps the reader 'feel' the subject matter more fully. 
===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * If the personification would be understood correctly, use it.
  * Using the words "like" or "as" can help clarify that this is a figure of speech, as in 1 Thessalonians 5:4, "...that the day should overtake you __like__  a thief."
  * If the personification would not be understood correctly, find a way to translate the meaning without the personification. For example, "The wisdom of God said" could be translated as, "God in his wisdom said."
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Therefore also __the wisdom of God said__, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,** Luke 11:49 (WEB)\\ 
Here the writer talks about God's wisdom as if it were a person who could speak.\\ 
\\ 
**No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. __You can’t serve both God and riches.__** Matthew 6:24.\\ 
Here the writer talks about riches as if it were a human master whom people might serve. 
===== Examples from English =====
**That delicious looking dessert is calling out to me, "Eat me. Eat me."** This personification helps to show how tempted the speaker feels to eat the cake. It also implies that the responsibility for the speaker's choice to eat the cake belongs to the cake.\\ 
\\ 
**The raging fire devoured everything in its way.** \\
This description of the fire helps show how terrifying and destructive it was by comparing it to a hungry person or animal that wanted to eat everything around it.
