\v 14 And I will abandon the people who remain alive, and I will allow their enemies to conquer them and steal everything valuable from their land.
\v 15 I will do this because my people have done things that I say are very evil, things which have caused me to become very angry. They have caused me to become angry continually, ever since the time that their ancestors left Egypt.'~"

<usfm>
\v 13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as
a man wipeth a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
\v 14 And I will cast off the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall
become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
\v 15 because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came
forth out of Egypt, even to this day.
