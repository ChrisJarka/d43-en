===== Resources - Important Terms and Translation Notes =====
**VERSION 3**
To help translators make the best translation possible, Translation Resources have been created. The Resources include Translation Notes, Important Terms, and Translation Questions.


**Translation Notes** are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain the context in which the stories from Open Bible Stories and the Bible was written as well as inform the translator of translation options available to them.\\


The **Important Terms** are key terms found in Open Bible Stories and the Bible. It is crucial that they be translated correctly. Each Important Term has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places that term is used in Open Bible Stories and the Bible to ensure that it has been translated correctly there, too.\\


The **Translation Questions** are available for the translator to check their work. These questions can be asked of anyone checking the translation work. Read the question, answer the question from the information in the translated text, look at the answer. Do both of the answers match? Then the transaltion is clear and accurate.


Once you have consulted the Translation Resources, then you are ready to make the best translation.\\
**Please use the Translation Resources when checking your translation!**
