\v 13 They must not come near me to serve as priests. They must not come near any sacred things or the holy offerings. They must be ashamed of the shameful things that they did.

\v 13 And they shall not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things,
to the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
\v 14 Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done
therein.
