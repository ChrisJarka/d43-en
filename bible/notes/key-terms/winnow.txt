====== winnow, sift ======

===== Definition: =====

To winnow means to separate grain from the unwanted chaff by tossing them into the air and allowing the wind to blow the chaff away. The word "sift" refers to shaking the winnowed grain in a sieve to separate any remaining unwanted materials, such as dirt or stones, from the grain.
