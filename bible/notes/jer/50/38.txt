<usfm>
\q
\v 38 A sword is against her waters, so they will become dry!
\q For she is a land of worthless idols, and they act like insane people over their dreadful things!
\q
\v 39 Therefore desert beasts with the jackals will inhabit there, and the offspring of ostriches will dwell in her.
\q So for all time she will no longer be inhabited! She will not be lived in from generation to generation!
\q
\v 40 Just as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors—this is Yahweh’s declaration—
\q No man will inhabit there and no child of man will abide in her!
