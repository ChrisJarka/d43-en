\v 54 The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
\v 55 For Jehovah lays Babylon waste, and destroys out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the
noise of their voice is uttered:
\v 56 for the destroyer is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for
Jehovah is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.
