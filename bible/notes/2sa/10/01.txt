\v 1 It came about later that the king of the people of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.
\v 2 David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. So David sent his servants to comfort Hanun concerning his father. Davidâ€™s servants entered the land of the people of Ammon.
\v 3 But the leaders of the people of Ammon said to Hanun their master, "Do you really believe that David seeks to honor your father because he has sent comforters to you? Has not David sent his servants to you to look at the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?"
