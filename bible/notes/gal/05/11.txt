\v 11 But, my fellow believers, \add although someone claims that I am proclaiming that men must be circumcised, I certainly am not still proclaiming that. Remember that the Jews are still\add* \add persecuting me\f + \ft Or: causing me to suffer\add* \f*. If I were still proclaiming that men must be circumcised \add in order for God to accept them\add*, the Jews would not be persecuting me.\f + \ft Or: why would the Jews be persecuting me? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add They would\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* not be \add persecuting me\add*, Or: causing me to suffer \add because\add* then \add the Jews\add* would no longer be offended. \add They\add* \add are offended\f + \ft Or: do not want to accept what I teach\add* \f* \add because I proclaim that Christ, the Messiah, died on\add* the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 12 I \add would even\add* wish that those who are disturbing you \add by insisting that men be circumcised\add* would also emasculate \f + \ft euphemism \f* themselves, \add with the result that they would be expelled from your congregations\add*!

\v 11 But, my fellow believers, maybe someone is saying that I still teach that you must let them circumcize you. I certainly taught that before I followed Christ, but I am not teaching that any longer. But what they are saying cannot be true; otherwise, no one would be persecuting me now. No, I tell you that if you think you have to be circumcized, then the fact that Christ died on the cross will not offend you any longer.
\v 12 I wish that those who are confusing you would go all the way and castrate themselves!

\v 11 Brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Circumcision circumvents the stumbling block of the cross.
\v 12 I wish that those who mislead you would go ahead and also castrate themselves.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted** - "But as for me, brothers, if I still taught that men must be circumcised to be saved, they would no longer be persecuting me." Paul is strongly claiming that he ("as for me"), unlike those he mentions in the previous verses, is not telling the Galatians to become circumcised.
  * **Brothers**- "Brothers and sisters." If your language can include males and females in one word, use it.
  * **Circumcision circumvents the stumbling block of the cross** - 
  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **you** - plural
  * **castrate themselves**  - This could either refer to 1) a physical act of cutting their male organs which can be translated as "cut themselves to become eunuchs" 2) a spiritual act which can be translated as "cut them off from the church" or "cut them off from God's people"
