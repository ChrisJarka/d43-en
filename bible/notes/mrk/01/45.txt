\v 45 The man did not follow Jesus' instruction. He began telling many people about how Jesus had healed him. As a result, Jesus was no longer able to enter towns publicly because the crowds would surround him. Instead, he remained outside the towns in places where no one lived. But people kept coming to him from all over that region.

\v 45 But he went out and started to tell everyone. The man spread the word so much that Jesus was unable to go freely into any town; he had to stay out in desert places so that people had to go out to him from everywhere.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **tell everyone...spread the word** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are used to emphasize that the man told a lot of people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **everyone** - The word "everyone" is an exaggeration to add emphasis. AT: "everyone he met." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Jesus was unable to go freely into any town** - "The crowds prevented Jesus from moving freely in towns" 
  * **from everywhere** - The word "everwhere" is an exaggeration to add emphasis. AT: "from all over the region." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
