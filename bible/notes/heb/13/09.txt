\v 9 So do not let other people persuade you to believe other things about God, strange things that you have not learned from us. For example, do not let anything make you obey various rules about what to eat and not to eat. These rules cannot help us.



\p
\v 10 Those who serve in the sacred tent have no right to eat at the sacred altar where we worship Christ.
\v 11 After the high priest brings into the very holy place the blood of animals that they have sacrificed to atone for sins, other people burn the bodies of those animals outside the camp.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Do not be carried away by various strange teachings. For it is good that the heart be strengthened by grace, not foods that do not help those who walk by them.
\v 10 We have an altar from which those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat. 
\v 11 For the blood of the animals killed for sins is brought by the high priest into the holy place, while their bodies are burned outside the camp.
