\v 5 You know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed. He shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war on the belt around his waist and in the shoes on his feet.
\v 6 Do therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.
