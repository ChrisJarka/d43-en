\v 14 People who sell some of their property will never be able to buy it back--they will not even be able to return to see it--because I, Yahweh, will never change my mind about what I have shown in a vision about destroying all of you people.
\p
\v 15 When those things happen, your enemies' will be outside the city with their swords, and there will be plagues and famines inside the city. Those who are caught outside of the city in the fields will be killed by their enemies' swords, and those who are in the city will die from famines and plagues.
\v 16 Those who survive and escape will flee to the mountains, and they all will moan like the moaning sound that doves make because of their sins.

\v 14 They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but there is no one marching to battle; 
\q since my anger is upon the entire multitude!
\q
\v 15 The sword is on the outside, and plague and famine are inside the buidling. 
\q Those who are in the field will die by the sword, while famine and plague will consume those in the city.
\q
\v 16 But some survivors will escape from among them, and they will go to the mountains. 
\q Like doves of the valleys, all of them will moan--each man for in his iniquity.
