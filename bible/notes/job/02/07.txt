===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **went forth from** - "went out purposefully from" Also, see UDB for meaning and further alternate wording.
    * **severe boils** - This could a known disease, or entirely new. They are large, festering, inflamed, disfiguring blisters of extraordinary discomfort.
    * ** potshard to scrape himself** - this may be used to counter-irritate, and thereby lessen the itching skin. It also may be used to scrape or cut the skin as a sign of grief. A "pot shard" is a piece of broken pottery.
    * **sat in ashes** - This is a figure of speech... a polite term for where Job was. The available broken pottery (potshards) and the ashes indicate that Job is sitting on the town dump. (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
