\p
\v 1 Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.
\v 2 So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.
\v 3 Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet
with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
