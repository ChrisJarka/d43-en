<usfm>
\v 1 If we could speak  \add all\add* the various languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* that people  \add in the world speak\add* and even speak  \add the language\add* that angels  \add speak\add*, if we did not love  \add others, speaking those languages\add* would be  \add as useless as beating\add* a brass gong or clanging cymbals  \add together\add*.
\v 2 If we had the ability to speak messages that come directly from God, and if we could understand the plans that he has not yet revealed  \add to others\add*, and if we could know everything  \add about everything\add*, and if we believed in God so strongly that we could  \add do impossible things like\add* causing mountains to move, if we did not love  \add others, God would consider all that\add* to be worthless.
\v 3 If we would give everything that we own to poor people, and if we would let others kill us in order that we could boast about  \add sacrificing our\add* own bodies, if we did not love  \add others\add*, we would not get any reward  \add from God\add*.

\v 1 If I am eloquent and speak so that people are moved and astounded, of if I could communicate with angels and discuss with them the mysteries of heaven itself, but if I am loveless, I am worth less than a tinny gong and a cymbal no one would play because the sound of it is no more than a clang.
\v 2 If I had the gift of prophecy, and I could explain the deep riches of God and his glory, and if I understood the wonders of knowledge and could teach them to the masses, but if I do not have love, my life has no value and my accomplishments have no meaning: I am nothing.
\v 3 If gave away all I own, every last penny, to feed the poor, or if I sacrificed my very life to be burned so that someone else might be rescued, but if I do not have love, my generosity and my sacrifice do not bring any enduring value nor do they bring any benefit into my life. I gain nothing by them.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but if I do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
\v 2 And if I have the gift of prophecy and understand all hidden truths and  knowledge; and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
\v 3 And if I give all I own to feed the poor and if I give my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
