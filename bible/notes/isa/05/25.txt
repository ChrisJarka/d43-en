\q1
\v 25 Therefore the anger of Yahweh is kindled against his people. He has reached out with his hand against them and has punished them.
\q1 The mountains tremble, and their corpses are like garbage in the streets.
\q1 Despite all this, his anger does not subside; instead, his hand is still raised to strike again.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the anger of Yahweh is kindled** - Isaiah speaks of Yahweh's anger as if it were a fire. AT: "Yahweh is very angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He has reached out with his hand against them and has punished them** - The prophet speaks of the future as if it had already happened. He does this to insist that the prophecy certainly will come about. AT: "he will punish them with his powerful hand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pastforfuture]])
  * **corpses** - "dead bodies"
  * **their corpses are like garbage in the streets** - The dead bodies are allowed to lie in the streets as if they were garbage. This implies that many will die but that no one will be there to bury them. The word "garbage" can also be translated as "refuse" or "manure." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
