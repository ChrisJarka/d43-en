===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **And** – This could be translated as, “Then” or, “In response.”
  * **My soul…my spirit** – These could be translated as, “Oh how I” or, “how I,” which express deep emotion. (See: [[en:tA:figuresofspeech:synecdoche|Synecdoche]].) Mary is using a form of poetry where she states the same thing in two slightly different ways. Both “soul” and “spirit” refer to the spiritual part of a person. She is saying that her worship comes from deep inside her.  If possible, translate these with two slightly different words or phrases that have that similar meaning. (See: [[en:tA:figuresofspeech:doublet|Doublet]]) 
  * **exalts** – That is, “highly honors” or, “greatly praises.”  
  * **rejoices in** – That is, “feels very joyful about” or, “is very happy about.”
  * **God my Savior** – That is, “God, the One who saves me” or, “God who saves me.”
