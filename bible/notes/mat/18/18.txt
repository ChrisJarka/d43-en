\v 18 Verily I say to you, What things soever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever you
shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\v 19 Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done
for them of my Father who is in heaven.
