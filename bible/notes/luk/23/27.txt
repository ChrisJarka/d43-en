===== translationNotes: =====

  * **A great crowd** - "A large crowd"
  * **great crowd of the people, and of women** - The woman were part of the large crowd, and not a separate crowd.
  * **mourned for him** - "mourned for Jesus"
  * **were following him** - This does not mean that they were Jesus' disciples. It simply means they were walking along behind him.
  * **turning to them** - This indicates that Jesus turned to face the women and address them directly.
  * **Daughters of Jerusalem** - The "daughter" of a city means the women of the city. This was not rude. It was a normal form of address to a group of women from one location. AT: "You women who are from Jerusalem"
  * **do not weep for me, but** - Jesus uses hyperbole to say that they had more reason to weep for their own situation than for his. AT: "do not cry about my situation. Instead," or "you are weeping for me, but even worse things are going to happen to you, so" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **weep for yourselves and for your children** - The person is a metonym for what will happen to the person. AT: "cry about what is going to happen to you and to your children" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
