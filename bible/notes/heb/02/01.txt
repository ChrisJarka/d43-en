  * **Connecting Statement:** - This is the first of five urgent warnings which the author gives.

  * **so that we do not drift away** - Believing in God's word less and less is spoken of as if a boat were drifting away on the water from where it should be. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
