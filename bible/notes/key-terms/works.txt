====== works ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible the term works is used to describe a person's deeds and actions.

  * The works that a person performs can be either good or evil.
  * A Believer's works are intended to reflect Jesus' character, and Christians will be rewarded for those works which do.
  * Non-Believer's works will be evaluated on the judgement day and the non-believer will give an account to God for their works. Their works will fall short of the glory of God and be the basis for eternal condemnation.
