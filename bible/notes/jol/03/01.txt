    * **my people, and my inheritance Israel**  - These two phrases emphasize how Yahweh views Israel as his personal and precious people (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]).
    * **Traded a boy ... sold a girl for wine**  - A lot of terrible things were done against God's people in exile. Their children were viewed as of such low value that a boy was given in exchange for the services of a prostitute and a girl was sold for a drink.
