===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **are you better than Thebes** - This question is comparing Nineveh to another very powerful and protected city which they had conquered.  The question is used to point out Nineveh can also be conquered. Alternate translation: "you are not better than Thebes" (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
    * **Thebes**  - This refers to Thebes, Egypt, the once capital of Egypt; an important city which was invaded by the Assyrians in 664 B.C.
    * **whose defense was the ocean, whose wall was the sea itself?** - This is saying the same thing twice in order to make the point clear. Alternate translation: "whose defense was water" (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])  Thebes was not on the ocean or sea but was on the Nile river.  By using the ocean and sea it is saying that Thebes bordered a large body of water. (See:[[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
    * **Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite** - Even though having the help of Ethopia and Egypt made Thebes powerful, no power except God is infinite or without end. This means their help made Thebes very powerful. (See: [[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
