\v 12 The harbor where the ship had stopped was not a good place to remain during the winter \add when the weather frequently becomes stormy. So most of the people on the ship decided that we\f + \ft exclusive \f* should leave there, because they hoped that we\add* could stay at Phoenix \add port\add* during the winter, if we could possibly arrive there. That harbor was open to the sea in two directions, \add but the strong winds did not blow there\add*.
\v 13 Then a gentle wind began to blow \add from the south\add*, and the \add crew members\add* thought that they could travel as they had decided \add to do. So\add* they lifted \add the anchor up out of the sea\add*, and the ship sailed \add westward\add* along the \add southern\add* shore of Crete \add Island\add*.

\v 12 The harbor was not a good place to remain during the winter, so most of the sailors advised going to sea from there. They hoped that they could reach Phoenix town  and spend the winter there.  Phoenix is a town in Crete. On it blow winds both from the northwest and southwest.
\v 13 Because there was only a gentle wind blowing from the south, the ship's crew thought that they could travel like they wanted to. So they lifted the anchor up out of the sea, and the ship sailed close along the coastline of Crete Island.

\v 12 Because the harbor was not easy to spend the winter in, most of the sailors advised to sail from there, if by any means we could reach the city of Phoenix, to spend the winter there.  Phoenix is a harbor in Crete, and it faces north-east and south-east.
\v 13 When the south wind began to blow gently, the sailors thought that they had what they needed. So they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore.
