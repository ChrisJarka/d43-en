\v 46 If you love only the people who love you, do not expect God to reward you in heaven! This is based on the fact that everyone, even the tax collectors, who you think are very great sinners, love those who love them. If you act like them, you are not any different from tax collectors!
\v 47 If you want God to bless only your friends, you are not acting any better than other people! Even the non-Jews, who you think sin very much, want God to bless their friends, but God does not reward them for that.
\v 48 You need to love those who do not love you, and in that way become perfect as God your Father, who is in heaven, is perfect."

\v 46 For if you love them that love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans the same?
\v 47 And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more than others?
do not even the Gentiles the same?
\v 48 You therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
