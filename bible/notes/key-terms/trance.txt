====== Trance ======

A state of revelation, such that the person experiencing the trance is able to see Jesus talking to them or see another vision from God.   Luke is clear that this trance is a vehicle of revelation induced by Almighty God to convey a message. Both Peter and Paul were in prayer when the revelation came to them. This was clearly intended to imply that this was an act of God.
