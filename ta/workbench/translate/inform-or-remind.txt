This module answers the question: What are phrases that inform or remind or how can I translate them? \\ 
Before you start this module have you learned about:

  * [[Distinguishing versus informing or Reminding]]  ([[ en:ta:workbench:translate:distinguish-versus-inform]])

[[Summary of 100 words or less]]
 
===== Description ===== 
 
Some languages can use an adjective or another phrase with a noun to give information about something or to remind people of something about it.  

  * Mary gave some of the food to her sister, who was very thankful. 
    * The phrase "who was very thankful" can be used to inform us about how Mary's sister responded when Mary gave her the food. In this case it is not distinguishing one sister from another. 
 
**Reason this is a translation Issue:** Some languages do not do this. If people see an adjective or another phrase right next to a noun, they will assume that the purpose of the phrase is to identify which item is being referred to.  

 
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**The name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Asshur.** (Genesis 2:14) \\  
There is only one Tigris River. The phrase "which flows east of Assur" gives more information about where the Tigris River was.  
 
**I will wipe away mankind whom I have created from the surface of the earth.** (Genesis 6:7) \\ 
The phrase "whom I have created" is a reminder of the relationship between God and mankind.  
 
===== Translation Strategies =====

  * **I hate those who serve worthless idols**  (Psalm 31:6) - When David spoke of "worthless idols," he was acknowledging that idols are worthless. He was not distinguishing worthless idols from valuable idols.  
    * "I hate those who serve idols. Idols are worthless."   
  
2.  Put the  informing or reminding word or phrase in a separate phrase with words that show why the information is important.    
  * **I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised** (2 Samuel 22:4) - There is only one Yahweh. The phrase "who is worthy to be praised" gives a reason for calling on Yahweh. This can be shown with the word "because."
