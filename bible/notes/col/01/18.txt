<usfm>
\v 18 And \add God's Son ranks above everything\add*, because it is he who \add rules over his people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as a person's\add* head \add controls his physical\add* body, because he causes them to live \add spiritually\add*. \add His Son\add* is the first one who rose from among those who have died, in order that he should become more important than anything and everyone.
\v 19 \add He reveals perfectly what God his Father is like\add*, because it is in his Son that his Father chose that he himself would dwell completely.
\v 20 \add God our Father caused his Son to rule us\add*, because he decided to reconcile to himself everything that is on earth and that is in heaven by what his Son did, in order that everything might honor his Son; that is, God our Father decided to reconcile everything to himself as a result of his \add Son's\add* blood \add flowing when he died\add* on the cross.

\p The chiastic material is rearranged below so that the directly related propositional clusters are joined together.
\p 13 God our Father rescued us \add spiritually\add* so that we are no longer ruled by the evil one, and God our Father transferred us spiritually so that we are ruled by his Son whom he loves. 14a That is, by means of what his Son did, we have been redeemed by God, our Father. 14b In particular, our sins have been forgiven by God, our Father. 20 God, our Father, has done this because he decided to reconcile to himself, by means of his Son, everything that is on earth and that is in heaven, in order that his Son might be honored; that is, God, our Father decided to reconcile everything to himself by means of God's Son's blood \add flowing out when he died\add* on the cross. 15b God cannot be seen by anyone, 15a but his Son reveals perfectly what God—his Father—is like, 19a because it is in his Son that the Father chose 19b that he himself would dwell completely. 15c God's Son ranks above everything 15d that has been created, 16 because it was by means of God's Son that God created everything that is on the earth and that can be seen by people, and also everything that is in heaven and that cannot be seen by people. In particular, all types of important spirit beings were created by means of him, since everything has been created by God by means of God's Son. And his Son ranks above everything, because everything has been created by God, in order that God's Son might be honored by everything, 17 and because it is he who existed before anything else existed, and since everything is sustained by God by means of God's Son. 18 And God's Son ranks above everything because it is he who \add rules over all believers, just like a person's\add* head \add controls his physical body, because he causes all believers to live spiritually\add*. His Son is the first one who rose from among those who have died, in order that he should become more important than everything and everyone.

\v 18 God's Son Jesus rules all those who believe in him in all the assemblies of believers in the world, like the head of a person's body controls his body. Jesus is the beginning of the universe because he created it, and he is also the beginning of "the Ekklesia," which refers to all the believers in the world as if they were all called together to meet at the same time and place to worship Jesus. :)  Jesus is the preeminent Son from dead persons because he was the first person to walk out of his grave in a new body that can never die again. So, Jesus is now preeminent in all things, the most important person to ever live!
\v 19 It pleased God the Father to dwell in God the Son with all the fulness of his being,
\v 20 and through Jesus God reconciled everything to himself. He made peace between God and sinful humanity through the his death on the cross as the bloody sacrifice for all our sins, for everything on earth or in heaven.

\v 18 He is the head of the body, the church. He is the originating authority, the firstborn out of the dead ones. He is the first among all things,
\v 19 because God was pleased for all his fullness to dwell in him.
\v 20 Through himself he reconciled all things to himself when he made peace through the blood of his cross, whether things on the earth or things in the heavens.
