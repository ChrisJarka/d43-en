\v 24 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do
his pleasure; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.
\v 25 And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in
their security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken
without hand.
