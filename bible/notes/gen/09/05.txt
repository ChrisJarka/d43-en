<usfm>
\v 5 I insist that murderers must be executed. Animals that kill people must also be executed. The reason that everyone who murders someone else must be executed is that
\v 6 I made people to be like myself \add in many ways\add*. So someone who murders another human being must be executed by others, \add because he killed someone who is like me\add*.
\p
\v 7 As for you, I want you to produce many children, in order that they and their descendants may live all over the earth."

\v 5 But for your blood, the blood that is your life, I will require payment. From every animal I will require it. From the hand of man, that is, from the hand of a man’s brother, I will require payment for the life of a man.
\v 6 Whoever sheds man’s blood, by man will his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.
\v 7 As for you, be fruitful and multiply, spread throughout the earth and multiply on it.
