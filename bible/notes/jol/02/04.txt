===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The description continues with the noises of an army of horses.

  * **The army's appearance is like horses** - The head of a locust looks like a small horse head. The army is fast, and horses are fast. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **horses** - A large, strong, fast animal with four legs. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **they run like horsemen** - Men riding horses move quickly, and the army moves quickly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **jump** - A horse jumps or leaps as it runs quickly.
  * **a noise like that of chariots ... like the noise of fiery flames ... like a mighty army ready for battle** - These sounds would have been very frightening to Joel's readers. If your readers will not understand what these sound like, you might be able to use a more general phrase: "a noise that frightens everyone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
