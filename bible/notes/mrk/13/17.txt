\v 18-19 In those days people will suffer very severely. People have never suffered like that since the time when God first created the world until now; and people will not suffer that way again. So pray that this painful time will not happen in winter, when it will be hard to travel.
\v 20 If the Lord God had not decided that he would shorten that time when people suffer so much, everyone would die. But he has decided to shorten that time because he is concerned about you people whom he has chosen .

\v 17 But woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!
\v 18 And pray you that it be not in the winter.
\v 19 For those days shall be tribulation, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God
created until now, and never shall be.
\v 20 And except the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the electâ€™s sake, whom he chose, he
shortened the days.
