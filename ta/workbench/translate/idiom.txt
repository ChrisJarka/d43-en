An idiom is a phrase that has a special meaning to the people of the language or culture that uses it. Its meaning is different from what a person might understand from the meanings of the individual words.

[[Jim's suggestions in red. An idiom is a certain kind of figure of speech, the kind that usually cannot be correctly understood without being told its true meaning. Every language has them. Some English examples are]]:

[[(The following examples are new and need to be added to the page. sq]]\\
  * You are pulling my leg (This means, "You are telling me a lie")]] \\ 
  * Do not push the envelope (This means, "Do not take a matter to its extreme") \\ 
  * This house is under water (This means, "The debt owed for this house is greater than its actual value") \\ 
  * We are painting the town red (This means, "We are going around town tonight celebrating very intensely")


==== Description ====

An idiom is a phrase that has a special meaning to the people of the language or culture that uses it. Its meaning is usually different from what a person would understand from the meanings of the individual words [[that form the phrase]].

>__He watched over me__, to take away my disgrace among people. (Luke 1:25 ULB) [[delete this example]]

The underlined idiom means "he had compassion on me" or "he regarded me kindly." [[delete this explanation. sq]]

>he resolutely __set his face__ to go to Jerusalem. (Luke 9:51 ULB) [[this example is okay]]

This idiom means "decided." 

Sometimes people may be able to understand an idiom from another culture, but it might sound like a strange way to express the meaning. [[this is a good point]]

> I am not worthy that you should __enter under my roof__. (Luke 7:6 ULB) [[this example is okay]]
The underlined idiom means "enter my house."

> Let these words go deeply into your ears  (Luke 9:44 ULB) [[okay]]
This idiom means "Listen carefully and remember what I say."

**Purpose**: An idiom is created in a culture probably somewhat by accident when someone describes something in an unusual way. But, when that unusual way communicates the message powerfully and people understand it clearly, other people start to use it. [[this is okay]]

=== Reasons this is a translation issue ===

  * People can easily misunderstand idioms in the original languages of the Bible if they do not know the cultures that originally wrote the Bible.
  * People can easily misunderstand idioms that are in the source language Bibles if they do not know the cultures that made those translations.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>For you are all __sons of__ the light and __sons of__ the day. We are not __sons of__ the night or the darkness.”  (1 Thessalonians 5:5 ULB) [[delete example; it fits nicely with a certain Hebrew metaphorical pattern]]

The phrase “sons of” here is a Hebrew idiom used to refer to people who have a certain characteristic. Jews used this idiom even when speaking Greek. “Sons of light” refers to people who live and act in the “light,” that is, the truth. [[delete]]

> "Then all Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Look, we are your flesh and bone." (1 Chronicles 11:1 ULB)

This means, "We and you belong to the same race, the same family."

[[Delete Romans 8 example and explanation below sq]]
>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God. If children, then also heirs, heirs of God __on the one hand__, and joint heirs __on the other hand__ with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.”  (Romans 8:16, 17 ULB) 

The phrase “on the one hand … on the other hand” is an idiom that joins two different ways of thinking about something. When we think about being heirs, there are two special things to think about. One is that we our heirs of God and our inheritance is from him; the other is that we are joint heirs with Christ and will receive an inheritance just as Christ will. [[delete example; it is an English idiom but not a Greek one]]

[[ADD Ps 2:2 example and explanation below]]
> The kings of the earth take their stand together (Psalm 2:2 ULB)

This means, "The kings on earth plan together."

[[Delete John 21 example and explanation below]]
> When __day was breaking__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.” (John 21:4 ULB) 
The idiom “day was breaking” shows that it is very early in the morning and the sun was just coming up as the day was beginning. [[delete example; it is an English idiom but not a Greek one]]

[[ADD Psalm 3:3 example and explanation below]]
> the one who lifts up my head" (Psalm 3:3 ULB)
This means, "the one who helps me."]]

==== Translation Strategies ====
If the idiom would be clearly understood in your language, consider using it. If not, here are some other options.

  - Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.
  - Use a different idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.

  * **It is for these things that the wrath of God comes upon __the sons of__ disobedience.** (Colossians 3:6) 
      * "It is for these things that the wrath of God comes upon __people who are __ disobedient."
      * "It is for these things that the wrath of God comes upon __people who__ disobey him." [[delete example]]

  * **If children, then also heirs, heirs of God __on the one hand__, and joint heirs __on the other hand__ with Christ**  (Romans 8:17 ULB)
    * “If children, then also heirs, __both__ heirs of God __and__ joint heirs with Christ” [[delete example]]

  * **When __day was breaking__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.**  (John 21:4 ULB)\\
    * "When __the day was starting__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus."
    * "__Very early in the morning__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus." [[delete example]]

[[ADD: I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof." (Luke 7:6 ULB) 
"I am not worthy that you should enter my house."

2. Use an idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.

    * "When __it was just starting to get light out__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus."
