==== Description ====

A **sentence** is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. The basic types of sentences are listed below with the functions they are used for.

  * **Declarative Sentence** or **Statement**  - These are mainly used to give information. '//This is a fact.//'
  * **Interrogative Sentence** or **Question**  - These are mainly used to ask for information. '//Do you know him?//'
  * **Exclamatory Sentence** or **Exclamation**  - These are mainly used to express a strong feeling. 'Ouch, that hurt!'
  * **Imperative Sentence**  - These are mainly used to make something happen, as in a command or instruction. '//Pick that up.//'

**Reasons this is a translation Issue**
  * Languages have different ways of showing that a sentence has a particular function. 
  * Some languages use these sentence types for more than one function.  For example, some languages also use questions for expressing strong feelings. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])

==== Examples from the Bible ====

The examples below show each of these types used for their main functions.

**Declarative Sentence** or **Statement** 

>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (Genesis 1:1 ULB)

**Interrogative Sentence** or **Question**
The speakers below used these questions to get information, and the people they were speaking to answered their questions.

Jesus said to them, "__Do you believe that I can do this?__" They said to him, "Yes, Lord." (Matthew 9:28 ULB)

The jailer...said, "Sirs, __what must I do to be saved?__" They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your house." (Acts 16:29-31 ULB)

**Exclamatory Sentence** or **Exclamation**

Exclamations express strong feeling. In the ULB and UDB, they usually have an exclamation mark at the end. The exclamation mark is underlined below.
>Save us, Lord; we are about to die__!__ (Matthew 8:25 ULB)

Some exclamations in the Bible often do not have a main verb. The sentence below does not have a verb.

>You worthless person! (Matthew 5:22 ULB)

Some exclamations have the word that shows feeling. The sentence below have "Oh" and "Ah".

>__Oh__, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

>Gideon understood that this was the angel of Yahweh. Gideon said, "__Ah__, Lord Yahweh! For I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face!" (Judges 6:22 ULB)

Exclamations often start with a question word such as "how" or "why."

>__How__ unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

**Imperative Sentence** 

There are different kinds of imperative sentences: command, request, instruction, and invitation.

With a **command**, the speaker uses his authority and tells someone to do something.
>Rise up, Balak, and hear. Listen to me, you son of Zippor. (Numbers 23:18 ULB)

With a **request**, the speaker uses politeness to say that he wants someone to do something. This may include the word 'please' to make it clear that it is a request and not a command.
>Give us today our daily bread. The speaker is asking for something. (Matthew 6:11 ULB)

>Please excuse me. (Luke 14:18 ULB)

With an **invitation**, the speaker says uses politeness or friendliness to suggest that someone do something if he wants to do it.
>Come with us and we will do you good. (Numbers 10:29)

With an **instruction**, the speaker tells someone how to do something. 
>...but if you want to enter into life, __keep the commandments__. ... If you wish to be perfect, __go, sell what you have, and give it to the poor,__ and you will have treasure in heaven. (Matthew 19:17, 21 ULB)

Imperative sentences are usually spoken to the person or people who are expected to do something. Even though a speaker would call the person he is speaking to "you," many languages do not normally use the pronoun "you" in a command.

>I say to this one, '__Go__,' and he goes, and to another one, '__Come__,' and he comes, and to my servant, '__Do this__,' and he does it." (Matthew 8:9 ULB)

Some imperative sentences are not spoken to the person or thing that is expected to do something. In English these commands often start with "let" or "may."

>Whoever sends his wife away,__ let him give__ her a certificate of divorce. (Matthew 5:31 ULB)

>Jesus said to the centurion, "Depart! As you have believed, so __may it be done__ for you." And the servant was healed at that very hour. (Matthew 8:13 ULB)
