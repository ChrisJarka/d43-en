\v 4 because we have heard that you believe in Christ Jesus, and that you love all those set apart for God.
\v 5 You love our fellow believers because you confidently expect to receive the things God is reserving for you in heaven. You heard about heaven previously when you heard the true message of the Good News about Christ.
\v 6 The Good News was proclaimed to you at Colossae, just as it is being proclaimed to everyone in the world. And just like it has changed you from the day you heard it and experienced the grace and true message of God, so also the Good News is changing people's hearts all over the world. It  is growing, like a field planted with crops gradually grows into a bountiful harvest!
