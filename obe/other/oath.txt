====== oath, swear ======

===== Definition: =====

An oath is a formal promise to do something or to tell the truth.  To swear is to say that what is being said is true.

  * Modern use of the word "swear" includes cursing, but this meaning is not used in the Bible.
  * When Peter denied knowing Jesus, he swore that he did not know him. This means that he stated this strongly, using an oath to convince people he was telling the truth (even though he was not).
