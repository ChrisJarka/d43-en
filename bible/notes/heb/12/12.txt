===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So, instead of acting as though you were spiritually tired out, trust God's discipline to renew you.
\v 13 Go straight forward following Christ so that believers who are weak in trusting Christ will gain strength from you and not leave God's way. Instead, they will be spiritually restored as an injured and useless limb is restored.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **lift up your hands that hang down, and make your weak knees strong again; make straight paths for your feet** - Possibly this continues with the thought of the race. It is in this way that the author speaks about living as Christians and helping others. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **straight paths** - Living so as to honor and please God is spoken of as if it were a straight path to follow. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **whatever is lame** - In this metaphor of running a race, "lame" refers to the same legs or perhaps knees. These, in turn, represent the Christians themselves. AT: "whoever wants to quit." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **may not be led astray** - Someone who stops obeying God is spoken of as if he had been led off the right path to follow. This can be stated in active form. AT: "will not follow someone down the wrong path."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **rather be healed** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "instead he will become strong" or "instead God will heal him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
