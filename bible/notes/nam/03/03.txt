\q
\v 3 There are attacking horsemen,
\q flashing swords, glittering spears,
\q heaps of corpses, great piles of bodies.
\q There is no end to the bodies; their attackers stumble over them.
\q
\v 4 This is happening because of the lustful actions of the beautiful prostitute, the expert in witchcraft,
\q who sells nations through her prostitution, and peoples through her acts of witchcraft.
