\v 1 Why boastest you yourself in mischief, O mighty man?
\q The lovingkindness of God endures continually.
\q
\v 2 Your tongue devises very wickedness,
\q Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
\q
\v 3 You love evil more than good,
\q And lying rather than to speak righteousness. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 You love all devouring words,
\q O you deceitful tongue.
\q
\v 5 God will likewise destroy you for ever;
\q He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent,
\q And root you out of the land of the living. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 The righteous also shall see it, and fear,
\q And shall laugh at him, saying,
\q
\v 7 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength,
\q But trusted in the abundance of his riches,
\q And strengthened himself in his wickedness.
\q
\v 8 But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God:
\q I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever.
\q
\v 9 I will give you thanks for ever, because you have done it;
\q And I will hope in your name, for it is good, in the presence of your saints.
