====== Forms of "You": Formal or Informal ======

This module answers the question: What are formal and informal "you"?

In order to understand this page, it would be good to read about:

  * [Pronouns] [[en:ta:workbench:translate:pronouns|on Workbench]]

Some languages make a distinction between the formal form of "you" and the informal form of "you".  This page is primarily for people whose language makes this distinction.

In some cultures people use the formal "you" when speaking to someone who is older or in authority, and they use the informal "you" when speaking to someone who is their own age or younger or who has less authority. In other cultures people use the formal "you" when speaking to strangers or people they do not know well, and the informal "you" when speaking with family members and close friends.

**Reason this is a Translation Issue**
  * The Bible was written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. These languages do not have formal and informal forms of "you".
  * English does not have formal and informal forms of "you."
  * Translators who use a source text in a language that has formal and informal forms of "you" will need to understand how those forms are used in that language. 
  * Translators will need to understand the relationship between two speakers in order to choose the appropriate form in his language.

=== Examples from the Bible ===

>**So, it seemed good to me also, having investigated everything accurately from the beginning, to write it down for  __ you __ in order, most excellent Theophilus. I want  __ you __ to know the certainty of the things that  __ you  __ were taught.** (Luke 1:3-4 ULB) \\ 
Luke called Theophilus "most excellent." This shows us that Theophilus was probably a high official who Luke was showing great respect to. Speakers of languages that have a formal form of  "you" would probably use it here.

>**Heavenly Father, sanctify __your__ name.** (Matthew 6:9 ULB) \\ 
This is part of a prayer that Jesus taught his disciples. Some cultures  would use the formal "you" because God is in authority. Other cultures would use the informal "you" because God is our Father. 


=== Translation Principles ===
  * Understand the relationship between a speaker and whoever he is speaking to.
  * Understand the speaker's attitude toward the person he is speaking to.
  * Choose the form in your language that is appropriate for that relationship and attitude.

===== Translation Strategies =====

You may be translating from a language like English, which does not use formal and informal forms of “you.” If your language has formal and informal forms, you may sometimes wonder what the relationship is between two people in the Bible in order to know which form to use. The translation notes will give you the information you need in order to make your decision. \\

Or you may be translating from a language that has formal and informal forms of “you,” such as Spanish and French. Even though these languages mark formal and informal “you,” you still may need to know the relationship between the people talking in order to know which form of “you” is best for your language. The rules in your language may not be exactly the same as those of the language you are translating from. So for you too, the translation notes will give you the information you need in order to help you make your decision.

The Formal 'You' is used when addressing someone in authority. The Informal 'You' is used when talking with a peer or someone with less authority. Most languages that make this distinction will use the formal form for strangers or people one does not know very well and/or to show respect to people of higher status.

Some of you will be translating from a language that has formal and informal forms of “you”, such as Spanish and French. Even though these languages mark formal and informal “you”, you still need to know the relationship between the people talking in order to know which form of “‘you”’ they would have used. This is because the rules in your language may not be exactly the same as the language you are translating from. So for you too, the people who are writing the translation notes will try to give you the information you need in order to help you make your decision.
===== Example from the Bible - Formal =====

Here are some examples from the Bible of where languages that make this distinction would use the **formal** form of “‘you”.

   * Luke 1:3-4 //Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. //

It is thought that Theophilus was probably a high official, judging from the way Luke addresses him as “most excellent.” If so, in many languages, the formal form of “you” (here and in the surrounding verses) would be used.
