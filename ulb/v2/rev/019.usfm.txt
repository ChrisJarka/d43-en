\c 19
\p
\v 1 After these things I heard as it were a great voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying,
\pi Hallelujah; Salvation, and glory, and power, belong to our God:
\v 2 for true and righteous are his judgments; for he has judged the great harlot, her that corrupted the earth with her
fornication, and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
\m
\v 3 And a second time they say, Hallelujah. And her smoke goes up for ever and ever.
\v 4 And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that sits on the throne,
saying, Amen; Hallelujah.
\v 5 And a voice came forth from the throne, saying,
\pi Give praise to our God, all you his servants, you that fear him, the small and the great.
\m
\v 6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty
thunders, saying,
\pi Hallelujah: for the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigneth.
\v 7 Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and let us give the glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his
wife has made herself ready.
\v 8 And it was given to her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright
and pure: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.
\m
\v 9 And he says to me, Write, Blessed are they that are commanded to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he says to me,
These are true words of God.
\v 10 And I fell down before his feet to worship him. And he says to me, See you do it not: I am a fellow-servant with you
and with your brethren that hold the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
\p
\v 11 And I saw the heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon called Faithful and True; and in
righteousness he does judge and make war.
\v 12 And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head
are many diadems; and he has a name written which no one knows but he himself.
\v 13 And he is arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
\v 14 And the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white
and pure.
\v 15 And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp sword, that with it he should strike the nations: and he shall rule them with a
rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.
\v 16 And he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND Yahweh OF YahwehS.
\p
\v 17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid heaven,
Come and be gathered together to the great supper of God;
\v 18 that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and
of them that sit thereon, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, and small and great.
\p
\v 19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat
upon the horse, and against his army.
\v 20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought the signs in his sight, wherewith he deceived them
that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image: they two were cast alive into the lake of fire that
burns with brimstone:
\v 21 and the rest were killed with the sword of him that sat upon the horse,
even the sword which came forth out of his mouth: and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
