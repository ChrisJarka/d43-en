\v 16 \add You all\add* know that I did not depend on you \add to provide for my needs\add*. However, \add there are some who accuse me, saying that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* I was very clever and got money from you by tricking you.
\v 17 But did I ever do that? No! I never \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* asked any of the men whom I sent to you \add to get money\add* from you \add and bring it to me\add*!
\v 18 Titus went \add and visited you because\add* I urged him to do so. I also sent the other believer, \add whom you know\add*, to go with Titus. \add You know that\add* Titus did not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* trick \add you in order to get money from you. And you certainly know that\add* he and I have always \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* acted in exactly the same \add honest\add* way \add towards you\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 And so, I put no financial burden on you. I am so crafty, I tricked you into letting me pay my own expenses!
\v 17 Did I ever take advantage of you when I sent another brother to serve you? They were supported by me, not you!
\v 18 I sent Titus and the other brother to you, and did they ask you to support them? Did Titus make you pay his expenses? Did Titus and the other brother not treat you the same as I did? We lived our lives in the same way, we were never a burden to any of you.

\v 16 But as it is, I did not burden you, but, since I am so crafty, I am the one who caught you by deceit.
\v 17 Did I take advantage of you by anyone I sent to you?
\v 18 I urged Titus to go to you, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not take the same steps?
