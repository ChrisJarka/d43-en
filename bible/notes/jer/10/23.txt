<usfm>
\q
\v 23 I know, Yahweh, that the way of a man does not come from himself. No person walking directs his own steps.
\q
\v 24 Discipline me, Yahweh, with justice, not in your anger or you would destroy me.
\q
\v 25 Pour your fury on the nations that do not know you and on the families that do not call on your name.
\q For they have devoured Jacob and consumed him so as to completely destroy him and demolish his habitation.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah prays for the people of Israel.


  * **that the way of a man does not come from himself. No person walking directs his own steps** - These two phrases mean the same thing. This means that no one has control over the various things that will happen to him during his life. AT: "that no person controls what will happen to him; no one is able to direct the events that he will experience" (UDB)  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Pour your fury on the nations** - This speaks of Yahweh punishing the nations in anger as if his anger were a liquid that he poured over them. Here the "nations" refer to the people who live in them. AT: "In your fury, punish the nations" or "In your anger, punish the nations of the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **do not call on your name** - This is an idiom. AT: "that do not worship you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **they have devoured Jacob and consumed him** - This speaks of the enemy army attacking the people of Israel as if the army were a fierce animal attacking its prey. AT: "they have fiercely attacked Jacob" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **devoured Jacob ... consumed him ... to completely destroy him** - These three phrases have the same meaning. Jeremiah repeats this idea three times to emphasize the utter destruction of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **For they have devoured Jacob ... and demolish his habitation** - Here "Jacob" represents the people of Israel. AT: "For they have devoured the people of Israel and consumed them so as to completely destroy them and demolish their habitation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **habitation** - the place where someone lives
