===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah** - God enabling the army of Judah to defeat the Ethiopians is spoken of as if God struck the Ethiopians. AT: "God enabled Asa and the army of Judah to defeat the Ethiopians" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **So many Ethiopians fell that they could not recover** - Possible meanings are 1) "So many Ethiopians died that the army could not recover" or 2) "So many Ethiopians died that there were none who remained alive."
  * **So many Ethiopians fell** - Here to "fall" is a euphemism for dying in battle. AT: "So many Ethiopians died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **for they were completely destroyed before Yahweh and his army** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "for Yahweh's army completely destroyed them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
