\v 18 When Zimri realized that the city was \add about to be\add* captured, he went into his palace and set it on fire. So the palace burned down, and he died \add in the fire\add*.
\v 19 He died because he had sinned by doing the things that Yahweh said were evil. Jeroboam had induced the Israelite people to sin, and Zimri sinned just like Jeroboam had sinned.
\p
\v 20 All the other things that Zimri did, and the record of how he rebelled \add against King Elah\add*, are written in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Israel.'

\v 18 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king’s house, and burnt
the king’s house over him with fire, and died,
\v 19 for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
\v 20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Israel?
