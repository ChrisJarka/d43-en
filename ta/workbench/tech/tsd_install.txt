== From Source ==

These instructions assume you have a Debian-based system (like Ubuntu).

Run this command:
<code>
 wget -qO- https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ouyusb8xr8vr1q/setup.sh?dl=1 | bash 
</code>

This will download all the environment pre-reqs and create a folder called 'ts-desktop' on your Desktop. You can then run:
<code>
 cd ~/Desktop/ts-desktop && gulp test 
</code>

If everything looks good, you can either run the app from the source by doing  npm start , or you can build a release using  gulp build.

== Install translationStudio ==

  - Download the latest version of translationStudio for desktop from https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/ts-desktop/releases 
  - Extract the zipped archive to any location on your computer.
  - You may now start translationStudio by double clicking the executable

**Note**: You might want to add a shortcut to the program onto the computer's desktop.
