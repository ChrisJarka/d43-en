\v 1 Now Joram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
\v 2 He did evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like his father and his mother; for he put away the sacred stone pillar of Baal that his father had made.
\v 3 Nevertheless he held onto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, by which he led Israel into sin. He did not depart from them.
