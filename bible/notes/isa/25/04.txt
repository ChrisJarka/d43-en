<usfm>
\v 4 For you are a protection to the poor, a guardian to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade
from the heat, when the blast of the ruthless is as a storm against the wall.
\v 5 As the heat in a desert, you will subdue the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of
the ruthless ones will be put down.
