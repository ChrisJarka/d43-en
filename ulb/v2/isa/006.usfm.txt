\c 6
\p
\v 1 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the
temple.
\v 2 Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,
and with twain he did fly.
\v 3 And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
\v 4 And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
\v 5 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of
unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.
\p
\v 6 Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the
altar:
\v 7 and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin
forgiven.
\v 8 And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.
\v 9 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not.
\v 10 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and
hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.
\v 11 Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the
land become utterly waste,
\v 12 and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.
\v 13 And if there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock
remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof.
