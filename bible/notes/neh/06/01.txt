\v 1 Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our
enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein (though even to that time I had not set up
the doors in the gates),
\v 2 that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me saying, Come, let us meet together in
one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
