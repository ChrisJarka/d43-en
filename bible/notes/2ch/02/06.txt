\v 6 But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I
should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?
\v 7 Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson,
and blue, and that knows how to grave all manner of gravings,
to be with the skillful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
