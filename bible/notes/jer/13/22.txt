\q
\v 22 Then if you say in your heart, “Why are these things happening to me?”
\q In the multitude of your iniquity your skirts are uncovered! Your heels are violently stripped!
\q
\v 23 Can Cush change its skin or a leopard its spots?
\q Then you yourself, accustomed to wickedness, will be able to do good!
\q
\v 24 So I will disperse them like chaff that perishes in the wind of the desert!
