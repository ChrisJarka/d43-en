===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak.
  * **My days are past** - AT: "My time is past" or "My life is over" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my plans are over** - AT: "my plans will never happen"
  * **even the wishes of my heart** - AT: "even my wishes will never happen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) 
  * **These people** - Job is probably referring to his three friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.
  * **change the night into day** - Night represents trouble, bad things that happen, and death. Day represents joy, prosperity and life. Job's friends have been telling him that if he repents, God will give him good things instead of bad. However, Job has been saying that he cannot repent because he has done nothing wrong. So, he has no hope for life and joy. (See: [[en:bible:notes:job:11:15|11:17]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the light, they say, is near to the darkness** - The light represents joy, prosperity, and life. The darkness represents trouble, bad things that happen, and death. Job's friends say that the light is near the darkness, because if he repents God will quickly give him good things instead of the bad things that he is experiencing. (See: [[en:bible:notes:job:11:15|11:17]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
