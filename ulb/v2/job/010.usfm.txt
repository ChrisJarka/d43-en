\q
\v 1 My soul is weary of my life;
\q I will give free course to my complaint;
\q I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
\q
\v 2 I will say to God, Do not condemn me;
\q Show me wherefore you contendest with me.
\q
\v 3 Is it good to you that you should oppress,
\q That you should despise the work of your hands,
\q And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
\q
\v 4 Hast you eyes of flesh?
\q Or see you as man seeth?
\q
\v 5 Are your days as the days of man,
\q Or your years as manâ€™s days,
\q
\v 6 That you inquirest after mine iniquity,
\q And search after my sin,
\q
\v 7 Alyough you know that I am not wicked,
\q And there is none that can deliver out of your hand?
\b
\q
\v 8 Your hands have framed me and fashioned me
\q Together round about; yet you do destroy me.
\q
\v 9 Remember, I beseech thee, that you have fashioned me as clay;
\q And will you bring me into dust again?
\q
\v 10 Hast you not poured me out as milk,
\q And curdled me like cheese?
\q
\v 11 You have clothed me with skin and flesh,
\q And knit me together with bones and sinews.
\q
\v 12 You have granted me life and lovingkindness;
\q And your visitation has preserved my spirit.
\q
\v 13 Yet these things you did hide in your heart;
\q I know that this is with thee:
\q
\v 14 If I sin, then you markest me,
\q And you will not acquit me from mine iniquity.
\q
\v 15 If I be wicked, woe to me;
\q And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head;
\q Being filled with ignominy,
\q And looking upon mine affliction.
\q
\v 16 And if my head exalt itself, you huntest me as a lion;
\q And again you showest yourself marvelous upon me.
\q
\v 17 You renewest your witnesses against me,
\q And increasest your indignation upon me:
\q Changes and warfare are with me.
\b
\q
\v 18 Wherefore then have you brought me forth out of the womb?
\q I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.
\q
\v 19 I should have been as though I had not been;
\q I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
\q
\v 20 Are not my days few? cease then,
\q And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
\q
\v 21 Before I go whence I shall not return,
\q Even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;
\q
\v 22 The land dark as midnight,
\q The land of the shadow of death, without any order,
\q And where the light is as midnight.
