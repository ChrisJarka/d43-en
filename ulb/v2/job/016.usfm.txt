\c 16
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said,
\q
\v 2 I have heard many such things:
\q Miserable comforters are you all.
\q
\v 3 Shall vain words have an end?
\q Or what provoketh you that you answerest?
\q
\v 4 I also could speak as you do;
\q If your soul were in my soulâ€™s stead,
\q I could join words together against you,
\q And shake my head at you.
\q
\v 5 But I would strengthen you with my mouth,
\q And the solace of my lips would assuage your grief.
\b
\q
\v 6 Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged;
\q And though I forbear, what am I eased?
\q
\v 7 But now he has made me weary:
\q You have made desolate all my company.
\q
\v 8 And you have laid fast hold on me, which is a witness
against me:
\q And my leanness rises up against me,
\q It testifieth to my face.
\q
\v 9 He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me;
\q He has gnashed upon me with his teeth:
\q Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
\q
\v 10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth;
\q They have struck me upon the cheek reproachfully:
\q They gather themselves together against me.
\q
\v 11 God delivers me to the ungodly,
\q And throws me into the hands of the wicked.
\q
\v 12 I was at ease, and he brake me asunder;
\q Yea, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces:
\q He has also set me up for his mark.
\q
\v 13 His archers compass me round about;
\q He clings my reins asunder, and does not spare;
\q He pours out my gall upon the ground.
\q
\v 14 He breaks me with breach upon breach;
\q He runs upon me like a giant.
\q
\v 15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
\q And have laid my horn in the dust.
\q
\v 16 My face is red with weeping,
\q And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
\q
\v 17 Although there is no violence in my hands,
\q And my prayer is pure.
\b
\q
\v 18 O earth, cover not you my blood,
\q And let my cry have no resting-place.
\q
\v 19 Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven,
\q And he that voucheth for me is on high.
\q
\v 20 My friends scoff at me:
\q But mine eye pours out tears to God,
\q
\v 21 That he would maintain the right of a man with God,
\q And of a son of man with his neighbor!
\q
\v 22 For when a few years are come,
\q I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
