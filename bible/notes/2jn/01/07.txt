<usfm> \v 7 Many people who deceive others have left your congregation and have now gone out among other people in your area. They are the ones who refuse to believe that Jesus Christ became human. They are the ones who deceive others and oppose Christ himself. \v 8 So be careful that you do not let those teachers deceive you! If you let them deceive you, you will lose the reward which we, together with you, have been working for, and you will not receive the complete reward of being eternally united to God! </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the anti-christ. \v 8 Look to yourselves, that you do not lose the things for which we all have worked, but that you may receive a full reward. </usfm>
