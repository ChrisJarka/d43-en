\v 3 Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there has been no latter rain; yet you had a harlotâ€™s forehead, you
refusedst to be ashamed.
\v 4 Wilt you not from this time cry to me, My Father, you are the guide of my youth?
\v 5 Will he retain his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and have done evil
things, and have had your way.
