====== Simon of Joppa ======

.

===== Facts: =====

This believer named Simon was a man living in the city of Joppa who hosted Peter in his home while he preached the gospel in that city.

  * Simon's work was to tan animal skins to make leather, which was used to make many different things such as sandals, water bottles, books and bags to hold wine..
  *
  * Peter had his dream about the sheet with many kinds of unclean animals on it while he slept on the roof of "Simon the Tanner's" house.
  * Because he came in contact with dead animals as a tanner, he would have been an outcast to the Jews. It would have been a great effort for Peter to accept this gentile tanner in fellowship, but he did so in obedience to God.
