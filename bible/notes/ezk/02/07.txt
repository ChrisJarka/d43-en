===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **come to an end **- "die"
  * **Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you**  - The Spirit is commanding Ezekiel to hear the message he has for the Israelites.  As we eat food for the body, the Spirit's message is spiritual food for Ezekiel as he teaches the people. (See: Metaphor)
