== "(Apollos) knew only the baptism of John" ==
Even after the death of Jesus, there remained some Jews who followed the teachings of John the Baptist, but who had not yet heard about Jesus. Apollos belongs to this group who was [[:en:obe:kt:faithful|faithful]] to God through following John the Baptist, but who awaited the [[:en:obe:kt:christ|messiah]] whom they did not know had come. The baptism to which this passage refers is John's baptism of [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]]. It is distinct from Christian baptism.
