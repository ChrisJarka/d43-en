\v 1 If you return, Israel—this is Yahweh’s declaration—return to me!
\q And if you will set aside your detestable things from before me, then you will not be homeless!
\q
\v 2 Then you will sweat, ‘Yahweh lives in truth, justice, and righteousness!
\q Nations will bless be blessed in him and they will praise him!’
\q
\v3 For thus says Yahweh to each man in Judah and Jerusalem, ‘Till your own soil,
\q And do not sow among thorns.’
