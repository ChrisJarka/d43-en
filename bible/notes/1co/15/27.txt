\v 27 For, "He put all things in subjection under his feet." But when he said, "All things are put in subjection," it is evident that the exception is the one who did subject all things to him.
\v 28 And when all things have been subjected to him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things to him, that God may be all in all.
