\v 5 Then he spoke to the others within my hearing, "Pass through the city after him and strike! Do not let your eyes have compassion,
and do not spare 
\v 6 either old man, young man, virgin, little children or women. Kill all of them! But do not approach any man who has the mark on his head.
Begin at my sanctuary!" So they began with the older men that were in front of the house.
