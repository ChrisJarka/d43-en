\v 9 We \add foreigners\add* would have tried to heal them,

\q1 because \add it is as though\add* the punishment they are receiving reaches up to the clouds in sky;
\q2 \add it is very great, with the result that no one can measure it\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 10 Yahweh has vindicated us\f + \ft Or: shown that we were right \f*;

\v 9 'We wished to heal Babylon, but she is not healed. Let us all leave her and go away,

\q
\v 10 Yahweh has declared our innocence. Come, let us tell in Zion
\q the deeds of Yahweh our God.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - It is the people of either Judah or of all the nations, whom Yahweh used Babylon to judge, who are speaking the words in this quotation.

  * **Babylon ... she is not healed ... leave her ... her guilt** - The name of the city is a metonym for the people who live there, and the city is spoken of as if it were a woman. AT: "the people of Babylon ... they are not healed ... leave them ... their guilt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **she is not healed** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "we have not been able to heal her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **For her guilt reaches up to the heavens; it is piled up to the clouds** - Guilt is spoken of as if it were an object that could be made into a pile. AT: "Babylon is so very guilty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]) 
  * **Yahweh has declared our innocence** - Yahweh had punished the Israelites for their sins, but now has let them return to him.
