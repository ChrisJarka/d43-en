<usfm>
\v 14 But there will be a time when people \add who are solemnly promising to do something\add* will no longer say, '\add I will do this\add*, \add just as surely\add* as Yahweh lives - the one who brought the Israelite people here from Egypt.'
\v 15 Instead, they will say '\add I will do this\add*, \add just as surely\add* as Yahweh lives - the one who brought us Israelite people back to our own land, from the lands to the north and from all the other lands to which he had exiled\f + \ft Or: forced us to go \f*.' \add They will be able to say that\add* because \add some day\add* I will bring your descendants back to this land that I gave to your ancestors.

\v 14 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that it shall no more be said, As Jehovah liveth, that brought up the
children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\v 15 but, As Jehovah liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries
whither he had driven them. And I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.
