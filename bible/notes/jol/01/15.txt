\v 15 Alas for the day!
\q For the day of Yahweh is at hand,
\q And as destruction from the Almighty it will come.

\v 16 Is not food cut off in front of our eyes,
\q Joy and gladness from the house of our God?
\q
\v 17 The seeds rot under their clods,
\q The granaries are desolate,
\q The barns are broken down,
\q For the grain is withered.
