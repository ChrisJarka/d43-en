\v 20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not.
\v 21 Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were
done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
