Depend: inclusive we ; pronouns

==== Description ====

Sometimes at the top of the list of notes, there are notes that start with **Connecting Statement** or **General Information**. 

A connecting statement tells how the scripture text in a chunk is related to text in earlier chunks.  The following are some of the kinds of information in the connecting statements.

  * whether this chunk is a the start of a passage, a continuation of a passage, or the end of a passage.
  * who is speaking

A general information note tells about issues in the chunk that cover more than one phrase.  The following are some of the kinds of information that appear in a general information statement.
 
  * who pronouns refer to
  * important background or implied information that is needed to understand the text in the chunk
  * Logical arguments and conclusions


==== Examples ====

> <sup>1</sup> Many have tried to set in order a narrative about those matters that have been fulfilled among us, <sup>2</sup>just as they handed them to us, who from the beginning have been eyewitnesses and servants of the message. <sup>3</sup>So to me also, having accurately investigated the course of all these things from the start—it seemed good to me to write them down in their order—most excellent Theophilus. <sup>4</sup>This is so that you might know the truth about the things that you were taught. (Luke 1:1-4 ULB)

  * **General Information:** - Luke explains why he is writing to Theophilus.

The general information note above briefly explains the content of the chunk.

> <sup>17</sup>For he was one of us and received his share of the benefits of this ministry." <sup>18</sup>(Now this man bought a field with the earnings of his evil act. Then he fell head first, and his body burst wide open, and all his bowels poured out. <sup>19</sup>It became known to all those living in Jerusalem that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.) (Acts 1:17-19 ULB)

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter continues his speech to the believers that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:01:15|1:16]].

The general information note above explains that verses 18-19 are background information about Judas. 

><sup>25</sup>For David says about him,
>'I saw the Lord always before my face,
>for he is beside my right hand so that I should not be moved.

> 1Jesus said to his disciples, "It is certain there will be things that can cause us to sin, but woe to that person through whom they come! 2It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble. (Luke 17:1-2 ULB)

  * Connecting Statement: - Jesus continues teaching, but he directs his attention back to his disciples. This is still the same part of the story and the same day that begin in 15:3.

> 7Now Herod, the tetrarch, heard about all that was happening and he was very disturbed, because it was said by some that John the Baptist had risen from the dead, 8and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the ancient prophets had risen to life again. 9Herod said, "I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?" And Herod tried to find a way to see Jesus.  (Luke 9:7-9 ULB)

General Information: - These verses are not part of the main storyline; they give information about Herod.

> 26Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip and said, "Arise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This road is in a desert.) 27He arose and went. Behold, there was a man from Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship. 28He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah. (Acts 8:26-28 ULB)

23You should no longer drink water, but rather you should take a little wine for the stomach and your frequent sicknesses. 24The sins of some people are openly known, and they go before them into judgment.
