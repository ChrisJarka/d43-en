\v 1 O foolish Galatians, whose evil eye has gazed upon you? Was not Jesus Christ graphically crucified before your eyes?
\v 2 I only want to learn this from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by believing in what you heard?
\v 3 Are you so foolish? Did you begin in the Spirit but now  finish in the flesh?
