The Gospel according to Matthew is one of four books in the New Testament that describe the life of Jesus Christ. They are four stories, which emphasize different parts of the life of Christ. He intended to show that Jesus was the Messiah, God’s chosen savior. Matthew explains to his reader that Jesus fulfills the Old Testament prophecies about the [[:en:obe:kt:christ|messiah]]. He also explains why the messiah did not deliver Israel from Rome. It was likely intended bring the Jewish people to a saving faith in Christ.


=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Matthew" may also be called "The Gospel according to Matthew," "The Good News about Jesus that Matthew wrote" or "This is what Matthew wrote about Jesus."

=== Who wrote the Book of Matthew? ===

The book does not give the reader the name of the author. Since early on, the church has believed that the author is Matthew, who was a tax collector before Jesus asked him to become his disciple.  He was also known by the name Levi.  Matthew was one of the twelve Apostles and he wrote for Jewish readers.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is the "kingdom of heaven?" ===

The kingdom of heaven is used in the same way as the "kingdom of God." Matthew uses these terms to refers to the reign of the messiah on earth and in reference to God's universal reign over the whole earth. Some scholars believe that there is a spiritual kingdom in the hearts of men where Christ reigns.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How do I translate "You have heard…but I say"? ===
This is a way the speaker contrast the views of the Pharisees with what Scripture actually teaches. There is an implicit understanding that, because the Pharisees made their own law to follow in addition to Scripture, they had abandoned the teachings of the Law of Moses. At other times, Jesus uses this phrase to expand upon the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Moses]] or to bring this law to its fulfillment. In these cases, the translator may wish to use the phrase "you have heard...now, I add to this"

=== Why does Matthew often refer to Jesus as the "son of man"? ===
This is a reference to a prophecy in Daniel chapter 9 where the son of man rides on the clouds in glory. It emphasizes the fact that Jesus is both fully man and fully God.

=== Why does Matthew frequently repeat himself? ===
While repetition is often used in Scripture for emphasis, Matthew also uses for other purposes. He uses repetition to group events or teachings together. He also uses repetition to give structure to a passage.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Matthew? ===
The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of more accurate manuscripts. The follow are the most significant issues in Matthew. The phrase "bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you" (5:44), "For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen" (6:13), and "many were call but few chosen" (20:16) were not likely in the original text of the Book of Matthew. Verses 17:21, 18:11, and 23:14 were not likely in the original text of the Book of Matthew.

=== What are the synoptic gospels? ===
