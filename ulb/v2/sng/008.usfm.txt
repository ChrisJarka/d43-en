\c 8
\q
\v 1 Oh that you were as my brother,
\q That sucked the breasts of my mother!
\q When I should find you without, I would kiss you;
\q Yea, and none would despise me.
\q
\v 2 I would lead you, and bring you into my motherâ€™s house,
\q Who would instruct me;
\q I would cause you to drink of spiced wine,
\q Of the juice of my pomegranate.
\q
\v 3 His left hand should be under my head,
\q And his right hand should embrace me.
\b
\q
\v 4 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
\q That you stir not up, nor awake my love,
\q Until he please.
\b
\q
\v 5 Who is this that comes up from the wilderness,
\q Leaning upon her beloved?
\b
\q Under the apple tree I awakened thee:
\q There your mother was in travail with thee,
\q There was she in travail that brought you forth.
\b
\q
\v 6 Set me as a seal upon your heart,
\q As a seal upon your arm:
\q For love is strong as death;
\q Jealousy is cruel as Sheol;
\q The flashes thereof are flashes of fire,
\q A very flame of Jehovah.
\q
\v 7 Many waters cannot quench love,
\q Neither can floods drown it:
\q If a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
\q He would utterly be contemned.
\b
\q
\v 8 We have a little sister,
\q And she has no breasts:
\q What shall we do for our sister
\q In the day when she shall be spoken for?
\b
\q
\v 9 If she be a wall,
\q We will build upon her a turret of silver:
\q And if she be a door,
\q We will inclose her with boards of cedar.
\b
\q
\v 10 I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers thereof
\q Then was I in his eyes as one that found peace.
\q
\v 11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
\q He let out the vineyard to keepers;
\q Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces
of silver.
\q
\v 12 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:
\q Thou, O Solomon, shall have the thousand,
\q And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
\b
\q
\v 13 You that live in the gardens,
\q The companions listen for your voice:
\q Cause me to hear it.
\b
\q
\v 14 Make haste, my beloved,
\q And be you like to a roe or to a young hart
\q Upon the mountains of spices.
