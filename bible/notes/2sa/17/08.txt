\v 8 You know that your father and the men who are with him are strong soldiers, and that now they are very angry, like \f + \ft simile \f* a mother bear whose cubs have been stolen from her. Furthermore, your father knows how to fight because he has fought in many battles. He will not stay with his troops during the night.

\v 10 Then your other soldiers, even if they are as fearless [SIM, IDI] as lions, they will become very afraid. Do not forget that everyone in Israel knows that your father is a great\f + \ft Or: strong \f* soldier, and that the soldiers who are with him are also very brave\f + \ft Or: courageous \f*.

\v 8 Hushai said moreover, You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds,
as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
\v 9 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them are
fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
\v 10 And even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your
father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men.
