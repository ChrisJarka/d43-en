\c 69
\d For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Save me, O God;
\q For the waters are come in to my soul.
\q
\v 2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing:
\q I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
\q
\v 3 I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried:
\q Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
\q
\v 4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head:
\q They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty:
\q That which I took not away I have to restore.
\q
\v 5 O God, you know my foolishness;
\q And my sins are not hid from thee.
\q
\v 6 Let not them that wait for you be put to shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts:
\q Let not those that seek you be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.
\q
\v 7 Because for your sake I have borne reproach;
\q Shame has covered my face.
\q
\v 8 I am become a stranger to my brethren,
\q And an alien to my motherâ€™s children.
\q
\v 9 For the zeal of your house has eaten me up;
\q And the reproaches of them that reproach you are fallen upon me.
\q
\v 10 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting,
\q That was to my reproach.
\q
\v 11 When I made sackcloth my clothing,
\q I became a byword to them.
\q
\v 12 They that sit in the gate talk of me;
\q And I am the song of the drunkards.
\q
\v 13 But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Jehovah, in an acceptable time:
\q O God, in the abundance of your lovingkindness,
\q Answer me in the truth of your salvation.
\q
\v 14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink:
\q Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
\q
\v 15 Let not the waterflood overwhelm me,
\q Neither let the deep swallow me up;
\q And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.
\q
\v 16 Answer me, O Jehovah; for your lovingkindness is good:
\q According to the multitude of your tender mercies turn you to me.
\q
\v 17 And hide not your face from your servant;
\q For I am in distress; answer me speedily.
\q
\v 18 Draw near to my soul, and redeem it:
\q Ransom me because of mine enemies.
\q
\v 19 You know my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor:
\q Mine adversaries are all before thee.
\q
\v 20 Reproach has broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness:
\q And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;
\q And for comforters, but I found none.
\q
\v 21 They gave me also gall for my food;
\q And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
\q
\v 22 Let their table before them become a snare;
\q And when they are in peace, let it become a trap.
\q
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see;
\q And make their loins continually to shake.
\q
\v 24 Pour out your indignation upon them,
\q And let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.
\q
\v 25 Let their habitation be desolate;
\q Let none dwell in their tents.
\q
\v 26 For they persecute him whom you have smitten;
\q And they tell of the sorrow of those whom you have wounded.
\q
\v 27 Add iniquity to their iniquity;
\q And let them not come into your righteousness.
\q
\v 28 Let them be blotted out of the book of life,
\q And not be written with the righteous.
\q
\v 29 But I am poor and sorrowful:
\q Let your salvation, O God, set me up on high.
\q
\v 30 I will praise the name of God with a song,
\q And will magnify him with thanksgiving.
\q
\v 31 And it will please Jehovah better than an ox,
\q Or a bullock that has horns and hoofs.
\q
\v 32 The meek have seen it, and are glad:
\q You that seek after God, let your heart live.
\q
\v 33 For Jehovah hears the needy,
\q And despises not his prisoners.
\q
\v 34 Let heaven and earth praise him,
\q The seas, and everything that moveth therein.
\q
\v 35 For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah;
\q And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.
\q
\v 36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it;
\q And they that love his name shall dwell therein.
