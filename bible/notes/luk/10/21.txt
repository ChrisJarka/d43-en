\v 21 Right then, Jesus was filled with great joy by the Holy Spirit. He said, "Father, you rule over everything in heaven and on earth. Some people think that they are wise because they are well educated. But I thank you that you have prevented them from knowing these things. Instead, you have revealed them to people who accept your truth readily as little children do. Yes, Father, you have done that because it pleased you to do so."
