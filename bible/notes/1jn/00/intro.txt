The letter of 1 John was probably written by the Apostle John near the end of his life. John does not identify himself as the author, but the first chapter shows that he is an eyewitness to the life and resurrection of Jesus.  

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Who were the people John spoke against? ===

It is possible that the people John spoke against those who would eventually become known as “Gnostics.”  These people believed that Jesus was completely God but that he was not really a human with a physical body on earth. The reason for this belief was based in an understanding that the physical world was [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]]. Therefore, John writes about being an eyewitness to the life of Jesus and how his own hands touched Jesus.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the author's tone or attitude in the letter? ===

There is a warm and loving tone that is expressed in this letter. It is written like a conversation between a father and his children.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 John? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of 1 John:\\

  * "and we are" (3:1). Some older manuscripts omit this phrase
  * Some older manuscripts add the phrase Jesus Christ "has come in the flesh."
  * Some manuscripts have different combinations of "water," "blood" and "spirit." (5:6)
  * "For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one." (5:7-8) (noted in the ULB). Most older versions omit this phrase

Translators are advised not to translate this phrase. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region have it, it is not wrong to translate it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of 1 John.
