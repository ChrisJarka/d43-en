===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You have eyes, do you not see? You have ears, do you not hear? **- These disciples, among all the Jews, should understand Jesus was using a metaphor.  They were not going to get bread from the Pharisees, or from Herod.  When Jesus spoke of the yeast of the Pharisees, and the yeast of Herod, it had to be a metaphor for their wrong teaching and decrees.  When they misunderstood, it was very frustrating for Jesus.
