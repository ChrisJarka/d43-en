===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Many translations will have to say "oak tree" rather than just "oak."
  * If oak trees are not known in the receptor area, this could be translated as "an oak, which is a large, solid tree likeâ€¦," then give the name of a local tree that has the characteristics of being a large, solid shade tree that has strong wood.
