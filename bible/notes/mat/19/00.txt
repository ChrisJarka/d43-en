======  Matthew 19 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Divorce ==
Jesus' teaching on divorce is not intended to be exhaustive instructions on divorce. It would have been permissible for a wife to divorce her husband if he became a murder, shows the limitations of this teaching. The section condemns the Pharisees and implicitly shows the limitations of follow their laws or traditions.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Hypothetical Situation ==
Jesus uses a hypothetical situation ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:19:20|19:20-22]]) to show a young man the true nature of his heart. It is unlikely that he was commanding this boy to sell everything because this is needed for anyone to be "perfect." This is also used in reference to the subject of divorce and the rich man entering into the kingdom of heaven.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Inherit eternal life ==
This phrase can be difficult to translate. Suffering is not a condition of "inheriting eternal life." The UDB could be understood in this way but any implications of conditionality must be avoided in translation.
