====== Colossians 03:9-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Do not lie to one another. Do not do those things, because you have disposed of\f + \ft Or: stopped obeying \f* your former evil nature and stopped doing what you did when you had that former \add evil\add* nature,
\v 10 and because you have received a new nature. God is causing your new nature to become more and more like his own nature. He created your new nature in order that \add you might get to\add* know \add God\add* truly.
\v 11 As a result of that, it is not \add important whether anyone is a\add* non-Jew or a Jew, or \add whether anyone is\add* circumcised or not, or \add whether anyone is\add* a foreigner, or even uncivilized, or \add whether anyone is\add* a slave or not a slave. But \add what is important is\add* Christ, who is supremely important in every way.

\v 9 And do not lie to one another. Do not do any of these things, because you have become a new person now, a person who does do these evil thins any more.

Do not do such sinful things, because you have removed the practice of mindlessly following your old, sinful self and the sinning it produces, as though you have taken off old, rotten clothes.
\v 10 You are a new person, and God is always making you new so you can know him better, the one who created you as a new person like himself.
\v 11 God has made us into new persons joined to Christ, and he is always making us new. So it is no longer important whether anyone is a non-Jew or a Jew, or whether anyone is circumcised or is not circumcised, or whether anyone is a foreigner, or even uncivilized, or whether anyone is a slave or not a slave. But instead what is important is Christ, who is all things in all of you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Do not lie to one another, for you have stripped off your old self with its practices,
\v 10 and you have put on your new self, which is being renewed in the knowledge of his image, the image of the one who created your new self.
\v 11 In this knowledge, there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but instead Christ is all things and in all things.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you ** - The pronoun "you" is referring to all the believers in Colossae.
  * **your ** - The pronoun "your" is referring to all the believers in Colossae.
  * **you have stripped off your old self with its practices, and you have put on your new self **- This is a metaphor showing that a Christian is to remove ungodly behavior and to begin acting godly in the same way a person removes and puts on clothing. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **practices ** - This word is referring to the evil deeds that were commonly done by a person before becoming a Christian.
  * **his ** - The pronoun "his" refers to Jesus Christ.
  * **new self ** - This is referring to the spiritually new person who is constantly improving in order to become more and more like the One who created that new image, Jesus Christ.
  * **knowledge ** - Both uses of the word "knowledge" convey the idea of full and experiential understanding, a personal awareness of who Christ is and all that it means to become more like Him.
  * **there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman ** - This is saying that God sees every person alike; race does not matter (Greek or Jew), religion does not matter (circumcision and uncircumcisionâ€‹ which is Jew or Gentile), culture of origin does not matter (barbarian, Scythian) nor does social status matter (slave, freeman). Everybody is acceptable to Christ and should also be acceptable to Christians. This could be translated "Here race, religion, culture and social status do not matter".
  * **all ** - Both occurrences of the word "all" come from a Greek word that means every, any, the whole. It is indicating that nothing is excluded or left out of the existence of Christ.
