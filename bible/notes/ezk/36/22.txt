<usfm>
\v 22 Therefore, say to the Israelite people, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: You Israelite people, it is not for your sake that I am going to do these things. Instead, it is for the sake of my sacred reputation, which you have disgraced among the nations to which you were forced to go.
\v 23 I will show that my reputation is sacred, a reputation which you have disgraced among the nations to which you were forced to go. And when I show the nations that I am holy, the people of those nations will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.

\v 22 So you, Ezekiel, say to the Israelite people that I, the Lord Yahweh, am telling them this: 'You Israelite people, it is not for your sake that I am going to rescue you from your enemies. Instead, I will do this so that the people in these other lands will honor me as God. You have done your best to disgrace me wherever you have gone.
\v 23 I will show that these other people-groups should worship me as God, even though they would never know it by watching how you act. When I prove to them that I am powerful and can do anything, then they will know that I will carry out everything that I say I will do.

\v 22 Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: I am not doing this for your sake, house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations everywhere you have gone.
\v 23 For I will sanctify my great name that you have profaned among the nations, everywhere you profaned it in their midst. Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh’—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—‘when I am treated as holy among you before their eyes.
