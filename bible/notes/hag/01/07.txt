\v 7 Thus says Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.
\v 8 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, says
Jehovah.
\v 9 You looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? says Jehovah of
hosts. Because of my house that lies waste, while you run every man to his own house.
