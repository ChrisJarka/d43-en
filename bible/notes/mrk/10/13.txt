===== Translation Notes: =====

 *  **Permit the little children come to me, and do not forbid them** These two clauses have similar meaning, repeated for emphasis. In some languages it is more natural to emphasize in another way. AT: "Be sure to allow the little children  to come to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) 

 * **do not forbid** - This is a double negative. In some languages it is more natural to use a positive statement. AT: "allow" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublenegatives]])
