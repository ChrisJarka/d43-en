\v 20 The tree that you saw, which grew, and became strong, and its top reached reached up to heaven, and it could be seen to the end of the whole earth;
\v 21 whose leaves were beautiful, and the fruit of it was abundant, and in it was food for all; under which the animals of the field lived, and in which  the birds of the heavens livedâ€”
\v 22 it is thou, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your  greatness is grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth.
