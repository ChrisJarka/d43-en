===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - While Jesus and his disciples are in a boat, they have a discussion about the lack of understanding among the Pharisees and Herod though they had seen many signs. 

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the author tells background information about the disciples forgetting to bring bread. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **no more than one loaf** - The phrase "no more" is used to emphasize how small an amount of bread they had. AT: "only one loaf" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **Keep watch and be on guard** - These two terms have a common meaning and are repeated here for emphasis. AT: "Keep watch" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod** - Here "yeast" is a metaphor that refers to evil ideas and false teachings. It may be helpful to add this parenthetical of background information to help clarify what Jesus was talking about. AT: "the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod." (Jesus was comparing the false teachings of the Pharisees and of Herod to yeast.)" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
