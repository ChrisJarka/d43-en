\v 33 \add Do as I do\add*. I try to please everyone in every way. I do this by not seeking to benefit myself. Instead, I try to benefit many others, in order that they may be saved \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* may save them \f* \add from the guilt of their sins\add*.

<usfm>
\v 31 The principle is that whether you eat a meal or drink something offered to you, or whatever you do, do everything so that your life will show what God has done and who God is, his glory in everything you do.
\v 32 Do not be offensive to Jews or  to Greeks, for they each have matters over which they can be offended, nor even to those in the church of God, do not be offensive to Christians about matters such as these.
\v 33 I make it my duty to please everyone I can, in every way that is possible. I do this by not seeking my own good and my own benefits. Instead, I try to benefit others, that they may be saved.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
\v 32 Give no offence to Jews or to Greeks, or to the church of God,
\v 33 just as I try to please all people in all things, not seeking my benefit, but I seek the benefit of many, that they may be saved.
