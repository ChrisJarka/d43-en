\v 13 We are not discouraged. We are like the person who wrote in the Scriptures, "God, I trusted in you and so I continue speaking your message." We also trust in God, so we continue speaking his message.
\v 14 We do this because we know that although people might kill us, God, who caused the Lord Jesus to live again after he died, will also cause us to live again after we die. God will do this because we belong to Jesus. And then God will bring us , together with you, to be with him.
\v 15 So I say that all these things that we suffer are in order to help you. We have suffered all this in order that more and more people, as a result of hearing that God will kindly forgive their sins, will thank him and praise him. Then they will greatly honor him and worship him.

\v 13 But we have the same spirit of faith according to that which was written, "I believed, and so I spoke." We also believe, and so we also speak,
\v 14 knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus, and will bring us with you into his presence.
\v 15 Everything is for your sake so that, as grace is spread to many people, it may increase thanksgiving to the glory of God.
