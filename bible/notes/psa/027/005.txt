  * **in the day of trouble** - "in the time of trouble" 
  * **he will shelter me**  - "he will hide me" or "he will protect me"
  * **in his booth**  - The word "booth" indicates a temporary shelter.
  * **in the cover of his tent** - The word "cover" indicates protection. This idea of protection is repeated here to emphasize it as well as for the beauty of the poetry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **He will lift me high...my head will be lifted up** - Again, repeated for emphasis.
  * **Then my head will be lifted up above**  - The word "head" represents the entire person.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
