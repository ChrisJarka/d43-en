\v 17 Therefore,
\q1 even if there are no blossoms on the fig trees,
\q2 and there are no grapes on the grapevines,
\q1 and even if there are no olives growing on the olive trees,
\q2 and there are no crops in the fields,
\q1 and even if the flocks of sheep and goats die in the fields,
\q2 and there are no cattle in the stalls, this is what I will do.

<usfm>
\q2
\v 17 Though the fig tree does not bud and there is no produce from the vines;
\q2 and though the produce of the olive tree disappoints and the fields yield no food;
\q2 and though the flock is cut off from the fold and there are no cattle in the stalls, this is what I will do.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Habakkuk describes his reaction to his vision of Yahweh.

  * **though the produce of the olive tree disappoints** - "though the produce of the olive tree fails" or "though the olive tree fails to produce olives"
  * **though the flock is cut off from the fold** - The word "flock" may refer to sheep or goats, or both. The word "fold" refers to the fenced in area where shepherds keep their flock. Habakkuk speaks of the flock dying as if someone were to cut off the flock, as a person would cut a branch from a tree. AT: "though all the flock dies and the folds are empty" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
