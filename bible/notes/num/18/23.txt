\v 23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
\v 24 For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a presented offering to Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
