\q
\v 8 Let them curse it that curse the day,
\q Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
\q
\v 9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark:
\q Let it look for light, but have none;
\q Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:
\q
\v 10 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb,
\q Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.
