===== Offline Distribution and Listening =====

//This page answers the question:// //How is content distributed and listened to offline?//

There are many ways to share and distribute audio resources in a local setting. Our focus is specifically on offline distribution and listening because the vast majority of people in the world do not have internet access, cannot afford adequate mobile data costs for effective listening, are not skilled at navigating websites to find audio resources and many other reasons. The most effective way to meet the needs of those interested to hear audio resources is to provide offline access across the platform that works best for them.

For many years devices have been designed for the ability to play digital audio. These may be in the form of a versatile radio with ports for digital data, generic MP3 players or audio players specifically designed for optimized delivery of Biblical content for the end-user.

Below we will briefly discuss a variety of options.
