    * devil

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **the devil led him up **- That is, "the devil took him up," or "the devil brought him up." The idea was not that the devil was leading the way and then Jesus was following him. Rather it was more of an active part on the devil in putting him up there.
    * **a high place**- literally, "a high mountain."
    * **of the world**  - the word here for "world" refers to the "inhabited world" as opposed to those parts of the world that are not. It can metaphorically refer to the Roman Empire as the "known inhabited world".
    * **Moment-**  Or, "in an instant" or "instantly."
    * **Therefore**  - That is, "since I rule over these kingdoms of the world and I can give it to whoever I desire."
    * **if you will bow down before me and worship me**  - That is, "if you, Jesus, give me honor and devotion and your allegiance."
    * **all of this will be yours **- That is, "I will give all these kingdoms to you" or "all of these kingdoms I showed you will be yours to have."
    * **bold words**  - explanation
