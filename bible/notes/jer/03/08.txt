They also \add have turned away from me and are worshiping idols like\add* women who abandon their husbands and go to other men \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 9 They thought that worshiping idols did not matter to me, so they have made the entire land unacceptable to me by worshiping idols of wood and stone.
\v 10 The people of Judah have pretended to return to me, but they have not really done that. \add This is true because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it."

\v 8 And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a
bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot.
\v 9 And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with
stones and with stocks.
\v 10 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not returned to me with her whole heart, but feignedly, says
Jehovah.
