===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **it came to pass** -  This phrase is used here to mark where the action starts. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **his entourage** - "the people surrounding him".
  * **who are you like in your greatness**  - "you think you are the greatest". While Pharaoh thinks that he is greater than everyone else, God is about to show him that this is not true. (See:Rhetorical question).
