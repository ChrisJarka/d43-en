===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Festival of Shelters - ** AT: "Feast of Tabernacles" or "Festival of Booths" or "Feast of Ingathering". The idea came from the practice of the farmers living in temporary booths, or huts, out in the fields to guard the crop as it ripened. See how you translated in Exodus 23:16.
  * **after you have gathered in the harvest from your threshing floor and from your winepress**  - AT: "after the grain has been threshed and the grapes have been pressed."
  * **within your gates**  - AT: “within your town” Cities often had walls around them to keep out enemies, and gates for people to go in and out. (See: Metonymy)
