====== Zechariah 11:7-9 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 So I became the shepherd of a flock of sheep that were about to be slaughtered \add for their meat to be sold\add* to the dealers. I took good care of the sheep, even the ones that were the weakest sheep. Then I took two shepherds' staffs\f + \ft Or: walking sticks \f*. I named the one staff 'Kindness' and the other staff 'Union.' And I took good care of the sheep.
\v 8 But the three shepherds detested me, and I became impatient with them. Within one month I dismissed\f + \ft Or: got rid of \f* those shepherds \add who had previously been taking care of the flock\add*.
\p
\v 9 So I said \add to the dealers\add*, "I will no longer be the shepherd. I will allow the ones that are dying to die. I will allow the ones that are getting lost to get lost. And I will not prevent those that remain from destroying each other."

\v 7 So I became the shepherd of a flock of sheep that dealers were going to slaughter and to sell the meat. Then I took two shepherds' staffs. I named the one staff 'Kindness' and the other staff 'Union.' This is how I began to shepherd the sheep.
\v 8 But the three shepherds who had been with the flock detested me, and I became impatient with the owners who had hired us all. Within one month I had destroyed those shepherds.
\p
\v 9 So I said to the dealers, "I will no longer be a shepherd for you. I will allow the ones that are dying to die. I will allow the ones that are getting lost to perish. And I will not prevent those that remain from eating each other."

<usfm>
\v 7 So I became the shepherd of the flock destined for slaughter, for those who dealt in sheep. I took two staffs; one staff I called "Favor" and the other I called "Unity." In this way I shepherded the flock.
\v 8 In one month I destroyed the three shepherds, for I ran out of patience with them, and they hated me as well.
\v 9 Then I said to the owners, "I will not work as a shepherd for you any longer. The sheep that are dying—let them die; the sheep that are being destroyed—let them be destroyed. Let the sheep that remain each eat the flesh of its neighbor."
