But because it does not penetrate deeply  into their inner beings, they believe it for only a short time. They are like the plants that did not have deep roots. When difficult things happen to them, they stop believing God's message.

\v 11 Now this is what the parable means: The seed is the word of God.
\v 12 And those The seeds that fell by the wayside are people they who have heard the word but then the devil comes  and takes away the word from their heart,  so that they may not believe and be saved.
\v 13 And Next, the seeds that fell those on the rock are they people who, when they have heard the word, receive it the word with joy, and these have no root but they do not have any roots; [or, but these have no roots;  who for a while believe they only believe for a while, and then in/during a time of temptation they fall away.
