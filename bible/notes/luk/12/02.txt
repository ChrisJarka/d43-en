<usfm>
\v 2 People will not be able to continue covering up their sins the way they can now. Someday God will let everyone know the things that people hide now.
\v 3 Everything you say in the dark, someday people will hear in the daylight. Whatever you whisper in your room will someday be as public as if it were shouted from the rooftops."

<usfm>
\v 2 But there is nothing concealed, that will not be revealed; and nothing hidden, that will not be known.
\v 3 So whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light; and what you have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed upon the housetops.
