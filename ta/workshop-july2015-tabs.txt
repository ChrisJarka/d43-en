====== Bookmarking and Working Tabs ======

We have found that it is very useful to have pages that we use frequently bookmarked. All of us work differently, so that one particular way does not suit all us 

Bookmarked pages – here is a list of the pages that we will be using a lot during the workshop. You might want to bookmark these too:
o	List of all Ezekiel chunks - https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/ezk/home
o	Important Terms List - https://door43.org/en/obe/home 
o	The entire book of Ezekiel in the ULB - https://door43.org/en/ulb/ep/26-ezk.usfm
o	The entire book of Ezekiel in the UDB - https://door43.org/en/udb/ep/26-ezk.usfm
o	Reference Guide for Notes - https://door43.org/en/bible/team-info/training/quick-reference/quick-reference-notes
o	Translation Academy Topics list - https://door43.org/en/ta/ta-topics 
•	Saved Tabs – we have found it very useful to have the above pages that we use during the workshop to be ‘saved tabs.’ Here are the links to the how to for 3 browsers:
