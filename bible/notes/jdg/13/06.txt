\v 6 Then the woman came and told her husband; she said, “A man of God came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel of God, very fearsome. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell him his name.
\v 7 But he said to me, “See, you will conceive and bear a son; now drink no wine or strong drink, and eat no
unclean thing, for the child will be a Nazirite for God from your womb to the day of his death.”
