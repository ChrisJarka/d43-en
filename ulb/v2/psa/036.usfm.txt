\c 36
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the servant of Jehovah.
\q
\v 1 The transgression of the wicked says within my heart,
\q There is no fear of God before his eyes.
\q
\v 2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes,
\q That his iniquity will not be found out and be hated.
\q
\v 3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit:
\q He has ceased to be wise and to do good.
\q
\v 4 He devises iniquity upon his bed;
\q He sets himself in a way that is not good;
\q He abhorrs not evil.
\b
\q
\v 5 Your lovingkindness, O Jehovah, is in the heavens;
\q Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
\q
\v 6 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;
\q Your judgments are a great deep:
\q O Jehovah, you preservest man and beast.
\q
\v 7 How precious is your lovingkindness, O God!
\q And the children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.
\q
\v 8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your house;
\q And you will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.
\q
\v 9 For with you is the fountain of life:
\q In your light shall we see light.
\q
\v 10 Oh continue your lovingkindness to them that know thee,
\q And your righteousness to the upright in heart.
\q
\v 11 Let not the foot of pride come against me,
\q And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.
\q
\v 12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen:
\q They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
