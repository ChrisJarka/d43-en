\v 16 Some people are like the ground where the soil was not very deep over the rock. When they hear God's message, they immediately accept it with joy.
\v 17 But, because the message does not grow deep, they believe it for only a short time. They are like the plants that did not have deep roots. When others treat them badly or cause them to suffer because they believed God's message, those people who are suffering soon stop believing God's message.

\v 17 They have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, and immediately they fall away.
