====== Son of Man ======

===== Definition: =====

The title, "Son of Man" is best known for how Jesus used it to refer to himself. There are many different interpretations regarding its meaning.

  * In the Old Testament, the phrase, "son of man" is often used as a different way to refer to a man, as in the verse, "What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?" (Psalm 8:4)
  * God also used it as a form of address as when he spoke to Ezekiel and said, "And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say..." (Ezekiel 36:1)
  * Jesus often used this term to refer to himself instead of saying "I" or "me" as when he said, "And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. " (Mark 13:26)
  * Jesus' prophecy about himself in the above verse also refers back to something Daniel saw in a vision hundreds of years before this: "...someone like a son of man was coming with the clouds of heaven..." (Daniel 7:13).
  * Many years later, John saw a vision in which he saw "...a white cloud and someone like a son of man who was sitting on the cloud..." (Revelation 14:14)
  * The title "Son of Man" emphasizes Jesus' humanity. While Jesus was fully God, he was also fully human.
