<usfm>
\v 12 They will take away all the people's valuable possessions and steal the things that the merchants sell. They will tear down the walls of the houses and destroy their fine houses. Then they will throw into the sea the stones \add from the walls\add* of those houses and the timber and the rubble.
\v 13 No longer will you sing noisy songs, and people will not play their harps anymore.
\v 14 They will cause the city to become a bare rock and \add only\add* a place where men spread their fishing nets. And the city will never be rebuilt. \add Those things will surely happen\add* because I, Yahweh the Lord, have declared \add that they will happen\add*.

\v 12 They will plunder your riches and loot your merchandise. They will tear down your walls and destroy your luxurious homes. Your stones, your timber, and the rubble they will throw into the waters.  
\v 13 I will stop the noise of your songs. The sound of your harps will be heard no more.  
\v 14 I will make you a bare rock. You will become a place where nets are spread out to dry. You will never be built again, for I, Lord Yahweh have spoken—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.
