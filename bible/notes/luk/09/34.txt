\v 34 And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the
cloud.
\v 35 And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear you him.
\v 36 And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the
things which they had seen.
