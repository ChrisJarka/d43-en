<usfm>
\q
\v 7 They trample on the heads of the poor as people trample on dust on the ground;
\q they push the oppressed away.
\q A man and his father sleep with the same girl
\q and so profane my holy name.
\q
\v 8 They lie down beside every altar on clothes taken as pledges,
\q and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who were fined.
