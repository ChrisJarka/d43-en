\v 29 There were seven brothers and the first took a wife, and died childless,
\v 30 and the second as well. 
\v 31 And the third took her, and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.
\v 32 Afterward the woman also died.
\v 33 In the resurrection then, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as their wife."
