====== Luke 15:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 When you brought it home, you would call together your friends and neighbors and say to them, 'Be happy with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!'
\v 7 I tell you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* that similarly\add God\add* will be very happy about each and every sinner who turns from doing evil. God does not \add need to\add* be happy about ninety-nine people who \add think that they\add* are \f + \ft irony \f* righteous and think that they do not need to turn from doing evil.

\v 6 And when you come home, you will call together your friends and neighbors and say to them: 'Be joyful with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!'
\v 7 I tell you that, in a similar way, there will be more joy in heaven because of one sinner who repents from his sins than about many righteous people who have already repented.

===== ULB: =====

\v 6 And when he comes to the house, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep.'
\v 7 I say to you that even so there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * Jesus continues his parable
    * **And when he comes to the house**  - That is, "When the owner of 100 sheep comes home with the lost sheep."
    * **Rejoice with me** - That is, "Be joyful with me" or "Join me in my joy." This is a request not a command, so it can also be translated as, "please be joyful with me" or "please join me in my joy."
    * **for I have found my lost sheep** - That is, or "because I have found my sheep, the one I lost."
    * **that even so** - That is, "that in the same way," or "that as the shepherd and his friends and neighbors would rejoice."
    * **there will be joy in heaven**  - This could also be translated as "there will be joy in God's presence" or "everyone in heaven will rejoice."
    * **ninety-nine righteous person who do not need to repent** - If this is a case of irony in which Jesus is only speaking of "righteous" people because the Pharisees thought that they themselves were righteous, then this could be translated as "ninety nine people who think that they are righteous and do not need to repent." Or if Jesus is implying that people who have repented are righteous, then it could be translated as, "ninety nine righteous people who do not need to repent anymore."
