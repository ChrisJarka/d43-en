===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **my son David**  - This is [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]].  Saul was indicating that David was like a son to him.
    * **Why does my lord pursue his servant?**  - This is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] since there was obviously no reason for Saul to come after David since David was not a threat to Saul.
    * **What have I done? What evil is in my hand?**  - Each of these is a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] since David has not done anything to threaten Saul.  See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]
