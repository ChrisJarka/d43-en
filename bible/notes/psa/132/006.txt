  * **we heard about it in Ephrathah** - The word "it" probably refers to where God's sacred chest was. The phrase "in Ephrathah" probably refers to where they were when they heard about it. This can be stated clearly. AT: "we who were in Ephrathah heard about where the sacred chest was" or "we in Ephrathah heard that the holy box was in Jaar"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **fields of Jaar** - Jaar is probably another name for the city of Kiriath Jearim. This probably refers to the fields surrounding the city.(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **we will worship at his footstool** - Worshiping God at the covenant box is spoken of as bowing at the feet of the king who is sitting on his throne. AT: "we will go to God's covenant box and worship him as king" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **your resting place** - "The place God chose for people to worship him is spoken of as if it were a place where he rested. AT: "the places where you stay" or "your tabernacle"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
