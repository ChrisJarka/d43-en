<usfm>
\q
\v 5 Let the righteous strike me, it shall be a kindness;
\q And let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head;
\q Let not my head refuse it:
\q For even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.
\q
\v 6 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock;
\q And they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
\q
\v 7 As when one plows and clings the earth,
\q Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
</usfm>
