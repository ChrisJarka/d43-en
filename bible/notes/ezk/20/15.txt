\v 15 I liften up my hand and solemnly declared to them in the desert that I would not take them into the land that I \add had promised to\add* give them, a land that was very fertile [IDI] and very beautiful\f + \ft Or: more beautiful than any other \f* land.
\v 16 The reason that I promised that was because they rejected and disobeyed all my laws \f + \ft doublet \f* and desecrated\f + \ft Or: refused to rest on \f* the Sabbath days. They did that because they \f + \ft synecdoche \f* were devoted to \add worshiping\add* their idols.

<usfm>
\v 15 Moreover also I sware to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them,
flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;
\v 16 because they rejected mine ordinances, and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went
after their idols.
\v 17 Nevertheless mine eye spared them, and I destroyed them not, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.
