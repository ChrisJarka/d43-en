\v 11 The last thing, brothers and sisters, is this: Rejoice! I want what is broken to be restored, what has caused you to be discouraged to turn into encouragement, when there have been so many arguments that you will find agreement, so you can live together in peace. And the God who loves you and who gives you his peace will be with you.
\v 12 Welcome each other in a way that tells everybody how much you love each other.
