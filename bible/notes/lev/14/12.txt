====== Leviticus 14:12-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Then the priest must take one of the male lambs and lift it up, along with the olive oil, in front of Yahweh, to be a guilt offering—an offering for his being guilty for not giving to Yahweh the things that he was required to give him.
\v 13 Then the priest must slaughter the lamb in the sacred place where the other sacrifices are offered. Like the offering to cause people to become acceptable to God, this guilt offering is holy, and belongs to the priest.

\v 12 And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and raise them up as an offering before Jehovah:
\v 13 and he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary: for as the sin-offering is the priest’s, so is the trespass-offering: it is most holy.
