\v 15 But the Lord answered him, and said, You hypocrites, does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his donkey  from
the stall, and lead him away to watering?
\v 16 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, lo, these eighteen years, to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath?
