\v 16 You must stop doing this, or I will come to you suddenly and I will speak words that will defeat those who believe this false teaching.
\v 17 Everyone who wants to understand must listen carefully to the message that God's Spirit speaks to the groups of believers assembled together. To him who conquers Satan, I will give good things like manna that is hidden. I will also give him a white stone to serve as a badge, on which I will engrave a new name for him, a name that no one but the one who receives it will know.'"
