\q2 and I have seen wicked people remain alive for a very long time
\q2 in spite of their continuing to be wicked.
\q1
\v 16 So do not think that you are very righteous
\q2 and do not think that you are very wise,
\q2 \add because if you think those things\add*, you will destroy yourself.

<usfm>
\v 15 All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his evil-doing.
\v 16 Be not righteous overmuch; neither make yourself overwise: why should you destroy yourself?
