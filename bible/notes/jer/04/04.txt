<usfm>
p
\v 4 Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem;
lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
\v 5 Declare you in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow you the trumpet in the land: cry aloud and say, Assemble
yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.
\v 6 Set up a standard toward Zion: flee for safety, stay not; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
