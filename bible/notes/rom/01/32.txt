===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **understand the requirement of God**  - They know very well that God requires them to live in his righteous way.
  * **worthy of death **- "they deserve to die for their sinful actions"
  * **they not only do**  - This should start a new sentence: "Nevertheless, they not only do these thingsâ€¦"
