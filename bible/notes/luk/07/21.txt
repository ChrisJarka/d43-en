\v 22 So he answered those two men, "Go back and report to John what you have seen \add me doing\add* and what you have heard \add me telling people. I am enabling\add* blind people to see. \add I am enabling\add* lame people to walk. \add I am\add* healing people who have leprosy. \add I am enabling\add* deaf people to hear. \add I am causing\add* dead people to become alive again, \add and I am\add* telling \add God's\add* good message to poor people.
\v 23 \add Also tell John that God\add* is pleased with those who do not stop believing in me \add because what I do is not what they expect the Messiah to do\add*."

\v 22 And answering, He said to them, "After having gone your way, report to John what you have seen and heard; the blind see again, the lame are walkng, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised up, the beggarly are evangelized.
\v 23 And happy is he, not offended by Me.
