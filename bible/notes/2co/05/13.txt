\v 13 \add Some of them say that after God has enabled me to see visions\add*, I \add talk like\add* a crazy person. If \add that is so, I want you to realize that I talk that way in order to please\add* God. On the other hand, if \add you think that\add* I \add speak and act\add* wisely, \add that is good. I want you to know that I do\add* that in order to \add help\add* you.
\v 14 \add I speak and act the way I do\add* because the love that Christ \add has for people\add* influences me \add in everything that I say and do\add*. When he died, \add he suffered the punishment\add* for \add the sins of\add* all people. So, we should all \add think of ourselves as having\add* died with him, \add being as unresponsive to sinful desires as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a corpse is.
\v 15 When \add Christ\add* died for the sake of all people, he died in order that \add we believers who are alive now\add* should not conduct our lives in a way that will just \add please ourselves\add*. Instead, \add we should conduct our lives in a way that will please\add* him, \add because\add* he is the one who died for us and was raised \f + \ft Or:whom \add God\add* raised \f* to life again.

\v 13 If people think we are out of our minds, we will be glad to appear that way, for we are serving God. But when we are in our right minds, it is to help you.
\v 14 Our love for Christ drives us on. We are sure of thisâ€”Christ died for all, therefore we have died with him.
\v 15 Christ died for all, so that those who live should not live for themselves, but they should live for Christ who died for their sins; and he is the one God raised from the dead.

\v 13 For if we are out of our minds, it is for God; or if we are in our right mind, it is for you.
\v 14 For the love of Christ compels us, because we are certain of this--that one person died for all, therefore all died.
\v 15 And Christ died for all, so that those who live should live no longer for themselves but for him who died and was raised.
