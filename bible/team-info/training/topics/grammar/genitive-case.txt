====== Genitive Case ======

The GENITIVE CASE in writing refers to words that show a 'genetic' relationship between words; using the genitive case helps us understand another word with greater depth or breadth. In the simplest form, genitive case shows possession (e.g. his name). Adjective and adverb phrases are common genitive case usage as well.The genitive case expands understanding of something being written about (ie 'sheep in the valley,' rivers of water).

Typically, genitive case uses the preposition "of" with a noun to describe connections. Examples are the best way to see how genitive case works. The //kingdom of God // is a genitive case example; the kingdom not only belongs to God, it shares His characteristics. The phrase has great meaning beyond possession. //In the name of Jesus// is a genitive case meaning more than Jesus' name; it speaks to us of doing things in the character of Jesus.

To summarize, genitive case increases understanding of one word by depicting ownership, qualitative description and/or original source. There are other more complex genitive case categories that can be explored, however, the basic remains the same: genitive case expands the understanding of another word.
