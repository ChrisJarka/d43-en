===== translationNotes: =====

  * **He will receive a blessing** - The word "he" refers to the ones with pure hearts mentioned in previous verse.
  * **and righteousness from the God of his salvation** - AT: "and God will deal righteously with him and save him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **those who seek him** - AT: "those who try to get God to pay attention to them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those who seek him, those who seek the face of the God of Jacob** - Two different verbs for "seek" are used here. Both have the same sense of coming to God in worship. AT: "the ones who approach God, they are the ones who may worship God, the one we Israelites worship" (UDB)
