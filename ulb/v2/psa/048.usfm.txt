\c 48
\d A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.
\q
\v 1 Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised,
\q In the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
\q
\v 2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth,
\q Is mount Zion, on the sides of the north,
\q The city of the great King.
\q
\v 3 God has made himself known in her palaces for a refuge.
\q
\v 4 For, lo, the kings assembled themselves,
\q They passed by together.
\q
\v 5 They saw it, then were they amazed;
\q They were dismayed, they hasted away.
\q
\v 6 Trembling took hold of them there,
\q Pain, as of a woman in travail.
\q
\v 7 With the east wind
\q You break the ships of Tarshish.
\q
\v 8 As we have heard, so have we seen
\q In the city of Jehovah of hosts, in the city of our God:
\q God will establish it for ever. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 9 We have thought on your lovingkindness, O God,
\q In the midst of your temple.
\q
\v 10 As is your name, O God,
\q So is your praise to the ends of the earth:
\q Your right hand is full of righteousness.
\q
\v 11 Let mount Zion be glad,
\q Let the daughters of Judah rejoice,
\q Because of your judgments.
\q
\v 12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her;
\q Number the towers thereof;
\q
\v 13 Mark you well her bulwarks;
\q Consider her palaces:
\q That you may tell it to the generation following.
\q
\v 14 For this God is our God for ever and ever:
\q He will be our guide even to death.
