\v 3  I say that to you because you have already spent too much of your time here on earth doing what the people who do not know God like to do. In the past you committed all kinds of sexually immoral acts, you got drunk and then participated in orgies and carousing,  and you  worshipped idols, which is very displeasing to God.
\v 4  Because you used to do those things, your friends are surprised that you do not join with them anymore when they participate in that kind of wild behavior  that is rushing to destroy them like a flood. As a result, they speak evil about you.
\v 5 But  God is ready to judge the people who are living  now and the people who have died, and he is the one who will decide whether he approves of what they have done.
\v 6 That is the reason why the message  about Christ was preached  to believers who have now died. That message was preached to them in order that even though  sinful people might judge them  and say that they are guilty, God's Spirit would  enable them to live  eternally.

\v 5 They will give an account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.
