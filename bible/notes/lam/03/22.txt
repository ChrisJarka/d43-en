\q
\v 22 It is by the covenant faithfulness of Yahweh that we are not finished off, for his merciful actions have not come to an end!
Replaced "mercies" with "merciful actions," abstract nouns becoming concrete events in the plural in BH.
\q
\v 23 His merciful actions occur afresh every morning; great is your faithfulness!
\q
\v 24 "Yahweh is my portion," declares my life; therefore I will hope in him.
