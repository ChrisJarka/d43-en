====== English Sentence Structure & Parts of Speech ======

A **//sentence//** is a group of words that express a complete thought. They may:

   * State something (declarative) 'This is a fact.'
  * Ask something (interrogative) 'Do you know him?'
  * Exclaim something (exclamatory) Ouch, that hurt!

The //**subject**// is who or what the sentence is about; Subjects are typically nouns or pronouns. Sometimes a subject is not stated but is implied. For example, 'Close the door.' The verb is close; the subject is implied to be 'you.' Gerunds and Infinitives (described below) can also be used as subjects.

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Compound sentences are two complete sentences joined together with a comma and a conjunction (i.e. and, or, but).</font>

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Complex sentences, which many Bible verses are, contain various components such as as phrases, clauses and/or participles.</font>

=== English Parts of Speech (not an exhaustive list but covers basics) ===

The **VERB**  is either an action or a state-of-being word such as is, are, was. The portion of the sentence which contains the verb is called the predicate. More detailed information can be found on [[:en:ta:vocabulary:verbs|Verbs]].

**NOUNS**  are words that represent a person, place, thing or idea. Proper Nouns are capitalized and refer to a specific entity (e.g. Peter, Calvary Baptist); common nouns are generic (e.g. disciples, church). Nouns have various roles in a sentence, including: subject, appositive (which renames a subject), nominatives, and objects. Also see: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:abstract-nouns|Abstract Nouns]]

**PRONOUNS**  take the place of nouns and include such words as he, she, it, they and we. More detailed pages on pronouns can be found on [[:en:ta:vocabulary:singularpronoun|Singular Pronouns]] and [[:en:ta:vocabulary:pluralpronouns|Plural Pronouns]].

**GERUNDS**  are verbs changed into nouns by adding 'ing' to the end of the verb. For example: Reading delivers treasures.

**INFINITIVES**  are words with 'to' placed in front of a verb. For example, 'To learn the details of English is challenging.'

**ARTICLES**  are the term used to describe the words: a, an, the. "The" is a definite article which means a specific one (e.g. the dog) instead of a generic description such as "a dog." 'A' is used preceding words that start with a consonant letter (e.g. a book); 'An' is used preceding words beginning with a vowel (e.g. an egg)

Articles are actually part of a larger group of words called **ADJECTIVES**. Adjectives describe nouns and convey such things as quantity, size and color; they help us identity 'which one' or 'what kind.' Also see: Adjectival Nouns (talink)

**ADVERBS**  are a group of words that describe verbs (or adjectives) and tell such things as how, when, why, to what extent or where. The majority of adverbs end in 'ly.',

**PREPOSITIONS **  are words that begin phrases which connect a noun or verb with more detail. For example, "The boat was //off the shore//." Off is a preposition (in an adverb phrase) that gives location information. Another example would be "The crowd //around Jesus//  grew in numbers." Around is a preposition (in an adjective phrase) helping us understand which crowd. Preposition examples include: aboard, above, among, before, behind, beyond, except, inside, through, toward, underneath, within.

**CONJUNCTIONS **  are very common words in English and join things (i.e. words, sentences). Examples of conjunctions include: and, or, but, for, yet and nor. Correlative conjunctions contrast things and must be used in pairs: both/and; either/or; neither/nor; not only/but also.
