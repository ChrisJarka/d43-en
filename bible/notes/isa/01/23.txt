  * **everyone loves bribes and runs after payoffs** - These are two different ways of saying the same thing. They emphasize that the leaders are not concerned with truth and making good decisions. They are willing to lie if someone will pay them enough money. (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]])

  * **nor does the widow's legal plea come before them** - "nor do they listen when widows come to them for help"
