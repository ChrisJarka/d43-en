<usfm>
\q
\v 12 For it was not an enemy who rebuked me,
\q then I could have borne it;
\q neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me,
\q then I would have hidden myself from him.
\q
\v 13 But it was you, a man equal to myself,
\q my companion and my close friend.
\q
\v 14 We had sweet fellowship together;
\q we walked in the house of God with the throng.
