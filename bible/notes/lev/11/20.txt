\v 20 All winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination to you.
\v 21 Yet these may you eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours, which have legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth;
\v 22 even these of them you may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.
\v 23 But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination to you.
