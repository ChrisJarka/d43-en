====== Ham ======

===== Facts: =====

Ham was the second of Noah's three sons mentioned in the Old Testament.

  * Ham and his wife were with Noah on the ark along with his two brothers, Shem and Japheth, and their wives, during the great flood.
  * After the flood, Noah became very drunk.  Ham accidentally saw Noah naked and informed his two brothers, who covered Noah.  It is not understood, but then Noah cursed Ham's son Canaan for Ham's inappropriate actions.
