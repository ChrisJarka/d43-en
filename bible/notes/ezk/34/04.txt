You have not brought back those who went astray. You have not searched for those who became lost. You have ruled your people harshly and cruelly.
\v 5 So they were scattered, because you did not \add take care of them like like \add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a shepherd \add takes care of his sheep\add*. And when they were scattered, \add it was as though\add* wild animals attacked and \add killed them and ate\add* their flesh.
\v 6 My people wandered like sheep all over the high hills and mountains. They were scattered all over the earth, and no one searched for them \f + \ft doublet \f*.

\v 4 You have taken care of the sick sheep; you have paid no attention to those who are wounded. You have not looked for the sheep who have wandered off. You rule over them with force and violence.
\v 5 Because you did not take care of them, my people have wandered away like sheep. And while they are scattered, wild animals attack and kill them, and then eat their flesh.
\v 6 My people wander like sheep all over the high hills and mountains. They are scattered all over the earth, and no one is searching for them.

\v 4 You have not strengthened those who have diseases, nor do you heal the ones who are ill. You do not bind up the ones who are broken,  and you do not restore the outcasts or seek the lost. Instead, you rule over them through strength and violence.
\v 5 Then they were scattered without a shepherd, and they became food for all the living beasts in the fields, after they were scattered.
\v 6 My flock strays on all of the mountains and on every high hill, and it is dispersed over the entire face of the earth. Yet no one is searching for them."
