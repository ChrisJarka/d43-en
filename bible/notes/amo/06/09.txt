<usfm>
\v 9 It will come about that
if there are ten men left in one house, they will all die.
\v 10 When a man's relative comes to take their bodies up—the one who is to cremate them after bringing the corpses out of the house—if he says to the person in the house, "Is there anyone with you?" What if that person says, "No." Then he will say, "Be quiet, for we must not mention Yahweh's name."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In 6:9-10 Amos describes a hypothetical situation of what it will be like when Yahweh hands the people of Israel over to their enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])

  * **if there are ten men left in one house, they will all die** - This seems to imply that something terrible is happening, and these ten men go into the house to hide. AT: "if ten men are hiding inside of a house, they will all still die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **a man's relative comes to take their bodies up—the one who is to cremate them after bringing the corpses out of the house—if he says to the person in the house, "Is ... you?"** - The meaning of these words is not clear. Possible meanings are 1) the "man's relative" is the one who will "take their bodies up" and "cremate ... the corpses," and he speaks to a person who hid in the house after the ten family members died or 2) the "man's relative" who "comes to take their bodies up" is a different person from "the one who is to cremate ... the corpses," and they talk to each other in the house. AT: "a man's relative comes to take their bodies up, and the one who will burn the corpses after they have been brought out of the house is with him—if while they are in the house the relative says to the burner of the corpses, 'Is ... you?'"
  * **cremate** - to burn a dead body
  * **bringing the corpses** - "bringing the dead bodies"
  * **Then he will say, "Be quiet, for we must not mention Yahweh's name."** - The meaning of this is not clear. It seems to imply that the one who asked the question is afraid the one answering will mention Yahweh's name carelessly. If he does this, it may draw Yahweh's attention to them, and he may kill them too. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
