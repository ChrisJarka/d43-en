===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins the account of how Peter denies he knows Jesus.

  * **courtyard **- an open area near the high priest's house
  * **denied it** - "said that she was not telling the truth"
  * **I do not know what you are talking about**  - This does not mean that Peter was unable to understand what the servant girl was saying. This statement was Peter's denial that he had been with Jesus.
