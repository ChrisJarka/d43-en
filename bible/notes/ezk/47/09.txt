\v 10 Fishermen will stand along the riverbank to \add catch fish\add*. From En-Gedi \add on the western side\add* to En-Eglaim there will be places to spread fishing nets. There will be many kinds of fish, like there are in the Mediterranean Sea.

<usfm>
\v 9 And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers come, shall live;
and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come thither, and
the waters of the sea shall be healed, and everything shall live wherever the river cometh.
\v 10 And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it: from En-gedi even to En-eglaim shall be a place for the
spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
