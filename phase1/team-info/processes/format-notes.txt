====== How to Format Translation Notes ======

Return to: [[:en:phase1:team-info:processes:create-notes|How to Create Translation Notes]]

===== General Principles for Formatting Notes: =====

  * Select a portion from the ULB that needs a note and write it in bold by one of the bullets under "Translation Notes."
  * Write a translation suggestion that can be used in place of the portion you have selected.
    * Put the suggestion in quotes.
    * If there is more than one suggestion, separate them with the word "or."
      * "X" or "Y" (See: TA-LINK)
      * AT: "X" or "Y" //(when this is the only item in the note)//
      * ...AT: "X" or "Y." //(when it follows other text in the note)//
    * When the suggestions are mixed, separate them with a period.
      * "X." AT: "Y." (See: TA-LINK)
  * Write an explanation if needed.
  * Refer the translators to a Translation Academy page if needed at end of note.
    * (See: Metaphor)
  * Normally we do not need to write notes for terms that are in the Important Terms list. However, when an important term has multiple senses, you may need to write a note telling which sense is meant in the text.


===== Formats for Specific Types of Notes: =====

There are several ways to write translation notes. We would like them to fit into one of the following formats so we can easily train the translators and so they will recognize the purpose of each note.

=== Definitions ===

Simple definitions of words or phrases can be added without quotes or sentence format.

  * **marketplace**  - a large, open-air area where people would come to sell their goods
  * **flute**  - a long, hollow musical instrument that is played by blowing air in or over one end
  * **kings' palaces**  - a large, expensive house that a king lives in
=== Explanations ===

Simple explanations about words or phrases should be in sentence format.

  * **washing their nets**  - They were cleaning their fishing nets in order to use them again to catch fish.
  * **motioned**  - They were too far from shore to call, so they made gestures, probably waving their arms.

=== Synonyms and Equivalent Phrases ===

Synonyms and equivalent phrases should simply be written in double quotes. They do not need to be full sentences and should not normally be punctuated. However, if they are followed by another sentence, they should have a final period to set them off from the following sentence.

  * **the way**  - "the path" or "the road"
  * **He went out**  - “Moses went out”
  * **feared God**  - "revered God" or "had reverence for God"

=== Alternate Translation(s) ===

Insert "AT:" before alternate translations that suggest changes to the form or content of the ULB because of the limitations of some languages. Examples include added implicit information, changing passive voice to active, and stating rhetorical questions as statements. The "AT:" indicates that this alternate translation should be used when the ULB form or content will not fit into a language.

  * **see the salvation of God**  - AT: "learn about how God saves people from sin"
  * **Follow me**  - AT: “Be my disciple” or “Come, follow me as your teacher”
  * **do likewise**  - "do the same thing." AT: "give food to someone who does not have any."

=== Translation Suggestion from the UDB ===

If the UDB provides a good translation that clarifies what is in the ULB, it is normally not necessary to include a note. However, on occasion it may be helpful to write a note or translation suggestion and also include text from the UDB. In that case, append "(UDB)" after the text from the UDB before the period as below:

  * **implored him**  - "begged him" or "pleaded with him" (UDB)
  * **he fell on his face**  - "he bowed down to the ground" (UDB) or "he knelt and touched the ground with his face"
  * **the sons of Heth**  - “the descendants of Heth” (UDB). AT: “the Hittites.” (See: Translate Names)
Please do not write notes that only say "See UDB."

=== Alternate Meaning(s) ===

Alternate meanings refer to different understandings of what the phrase means. In this case, prefix the meanings with "Possible meanings are" and number them with the preferred meaning first (This should be the same meaning as what is in the ULB and UDB).

If the meaning is given as an explanation, do not put it in quotes.

  * **You are like a young lion…like a monster in the seas**  - Possible meanings are that 1) he was like a lion and a monster or 2) he thought he was like a lion, but he was really only a monster.
  * **like a monster in the seas**  - Possible meanings are that 1) he was powerful or 2) he was not doing anything important.
If the meaning is given in a way that can be used as a translation, put it in quotes.

  * **fell down at Jesus' knees**  - Possible meanings are 1) "bowed down at Jesus' feet" or 2) "lay down on the ground at Jesus' feet" or 3) "knelt down before Jesus." Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus.

=== Ellipses "..." ===

  * Ellipses are defined as 3 periods "…".
  * There are no spaces between the ellipses and text.
      * "I completely understand the Bible." becomes "I…understand the Bible."
  * Do NOT use an ellipse at the end of the quote.
      * "<del>I completely understand…</del>" This is incorrect. Do not use ellipses this way!
  * The one exception is when you need to include the punctuation for an alternate translation. If the punctuation is a period, include the last word in the sentence. Otherwise, end it with an ellipsis and punctuation ("!", ",").
      * "Do I understand the Bible?" becomes "Do I understand…?" The alternate translation suggestion, "I do indeed understand…!"
      * "Do I understand the Bible?" becomes "Do I…?" The alternate translation suggestion, "I do…Bible."

=== Identify Figures of Speech ===

When writing a note to identify and explain a figure of speech, use sentence form and put the meaning in quotes.

  * **Make ready the way of the Lord**  - This phrase compares people preparing themselves for the arrival of the Lord to people who are repairing a road for someone to use it. AT: "Repent and be ready for when the Lord comes." (See: Metaphor)
  * **You offspring of poisonous snakes**  - Jesus uses this expression to emphasize how dangerous the Pharisees are. Poisonous snakes are dangerous and represent evil. AT: "You evil, poisonous snakes!" or "You are evil like poisonous snakes." (See: Metaphor)

  * **Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness** - “full” here is an exaggeration and the word “mouths” here represents the people's thoughts. AT: “Much of what people say is harmful and meant to hurt other people.” (See: Hyperbole and Synecdoche)

If there is a Translation Academy page that deals with a figure of speech, you can include it in the note. You can see the list of topics at: [[:en:ta:ta-topics|translationAcademy Topics]]

  * Refer to tA topics by writing, for example, "(See: Metonymy)" or "(See: Exclusive)" at the end of the note. You can see these at [[:en:ta:ta-topics|translationAcademy Topics]].

=== Indirect to Direct Quote ===

When adding the option for a direct quote, preface the alternate with "This can be translated as a direct quote:" followed by the new phrase.

  * **to tell no one**  - This can be translated as a direct quote: "Do not tell anyone." The implied information is "that you have been healed." (See: Direct and Indirect Quotes and Making Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information Explicit)

=== Explanation of Source Language ===

In general, we want to downplay the original languages because most of the users of the notes will not have had any training in them. This does not mean we avoid the content. Rather, we should look for simple ways to express it. When possible, use plain-language explanations in English.

  * **sinful man**  - The word here for "man" means "adult male" and not the more general "human being."
  * **Master**  - The word that is translated here as “Master” is not the normal word for “Master.” This one refers to someone who has authority, and not to someone who owns someone else. AT: "Boss" or "Foreman" or use a word that is commonly used to address a person in authority, such as “Sir.”

=== Multiple Notes on Long Phrases ===

Sometimes we need notes for a phrase and separate notes for portions of that phrase. In that case, we list the larger phrase first, and its parts afterward, unless there is a compelling reason to reverse them.

  * **you say, 'Behold, he is a gluttonous man**  - This can be translated as an indirect quote: "you say that he is a gluttonous man" or "you accuse him of being a gluttonous man."
  * **he is a gluttonous man**  - "he is a greedy eater" or "he habitually eats too much food"
=== Repeated Phrases in a Book ===

Sometimes a phrase is used multiple times in a book. We can make it easier for the translators by reminding them of where they have already translated that phrase so they can translate it the same way. We point them back to notes only in the book they are working on.

  * **be fruitful and multiply**  - See how you translated these commands in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:28|1:28]]
  * **everything that creeps along the ground**  - This includes all types of small animals. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:24|1:25]].
  * **will be blessed in him**  - AT: "will be blessed because of Abraham" or "will be blessed because I have blessed Abraham." For translating "in him," see how you translated "through you" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:12:01|12:3]].

=== Connecting Statement & General Statement (under development) ===

There are two special types of notes that contain fixed text for the ULB phrase. they are **Connecting Statement:**  and **General Statement:**.

  * **Connecting Statement:**  - This is a note that relates the current chunk to the current discourse. When present, it must be the first note and separated by a blank line from the rest of the notes unless there is also a general statement. There is only one connecting statement used per chunk.
  * **General Statement:**  - This is a note that addresses other discourse topics not mentioned in the connecting statement. When present, it must must immediately follow the connecting statement and be separated by a blank line from the rest of the notes. There can be one or more connecting statements in a chunk.
<code>
  * **Connecting Statement:** - [explanation]
  * **General Statement:** - [explanation]
  [blank line]
  * **[Phrase]** - [Explanation]
</code>

  * **Connecting Statement:**  - Luke explains why he is writing to Theophilus.
