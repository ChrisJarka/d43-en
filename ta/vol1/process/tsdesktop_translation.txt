==== tS-Desktop and tS-Android ====

translationStudio-Desktop is designed to work in much the same way as translationStudio-Android. Please consult the instructions for tS-Android below. 

==== Using Translation Helps ====

  - Once the source text is set up (see [[en:ta:vol1:process:setup_tsandroid]]) on translationStudio, then you are ready to start translating. 
    * It is strongly recommended that you consult the translationNotes and translationWords while doing your translation
  - For the best way to use translationNotes in translationStudio, please read [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_resources]]

==== After Translating on translationStudio ====

  - We strongly recommend that your translation be checked (see [[en:ta:vol1:process:prechecking_training]]).
  - Once the checking is complete (to any level), you may upload your work (see  [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_upload|upload]]).
  - Once uploaded, you will need to merge your work into Door43 (see [[en:ta:vol1:process:upload_merge]]).
