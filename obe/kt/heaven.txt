====== heaven, sky, heavens, heavenly ======

===== Definition: =====

The term that is translated as "heaven" refers to where God lives. The term "heavens" refers to planets, stars and all else that is up in the sky beyond what we can see.

  * The same word is sometimes translated as "sky," depending on the context. This refers to everything that is up in the sky, including the air, clouds, and the sun.
  * In some contexts, the word "heaven" could refer to either the sky or the place where God lives.
  * The term "heavens" refers to everything we see above the earth, including the sun, moon, and stars.
  * When "heaven" is used figuratively, it is a way of referring to God. So for example, the "kingdom of heaven" really means the "kingdom of God."

  * When it is translated as "sky," this is the blue expanse above the earth that has clouds and the air we breathe.
