\v 1 Then said Jehovah to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind would not be toward this people: cast them
out of my sight, and let them go forth.
\v 2 And it shall come to pass, when they say to thee, Whither shall we go forth? then you shall tell them, Thus says
Jehovah: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the
famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.
