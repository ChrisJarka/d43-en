\v 19 Yet say ye, Wherefore does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and
right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.
\v 20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the
iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
