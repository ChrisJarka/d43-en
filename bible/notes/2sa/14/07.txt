\v 7 Now, all my family oppose me. They are insisting that I allow them to kill my son who is still alive \f + \ft metonymy \f*, in order that they may get revenge for his killing his brother. But if they do that, I will not have any son to inherit \add my possessions\add*. That would be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* extinguishing the last coals of a fire, and my husband would not have a son to preserve our family's name. \f + \ft doublet \f*"

\v 7 And look, the whole family has risen against your servant, and they say, 'Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also.' If they do that, they will put out my only coal left, and they will leave to my husband neither name nor a descendant upon the face of the earth."
