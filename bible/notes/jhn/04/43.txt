\v 43-44 Jesus had said \add previously\add* that people did not honor prophets \add like himself when they tried to teach people\add* in their own home area. So, two days later, Jesus and \add we\add* disciples left that area and went to \add his own area in\add* Galilee \add district, because he knew that people there would not think very highly of him, and as a result the Jewish leaders would not be jealous\add*.
\v 45 However, when we arrived in Galilee \add district, many\add* of the people there welcomed him, because they had been in Jerusalem during the \add Passover\add* celebration and had seen all the things he did there.
