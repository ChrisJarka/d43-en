[[Summary of 100 words or less]] 
===== Description ===== 
Sometimes a noun phrase refers to people or things in general rather than to specific individuals or things. This happens frequently in Proverbs, because proverbs tell about things that are true about people in general. 
 
**Can __a man__ walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?** \\   
**So is __the man who goes into his neighbor’s wife__;** \\ 
**__the one who has relations with her__ will not go unpunished.** (Proverbs 6:28) 
The underlined phrases do not refer to a specific man. They refer to any man who does these things. 
 
**Reason this is a translation issue**: Different languages have different ways marking noun phrases that refer to a generic idea. Translators should refer to generic ideas in ways that are natural in their language. 
 
===== Examples from the Bible  =====
**People curse __the man who refuses to sell them grain__** (Proverbs 11:26) \\ 
This does not refer to a particular man, but to the generic idea of any person who refuses to sell grain. 

**Yahweh gives favor to __a good man__, but he condemns __a man who makes evil plans__.** (Proverbs 12:2) \\ 
The phrase "a good man" does not refer to a particular man, but to the generic idea of any person who is good. \\ 
The phrase "a man who makes evil plans" does not refer to a particular man, but to the generic idea of any person who makes evil plans. 
 
===== Translation Strategies ===== 
If your language can use the same wording as in the ULB and refer to people or things in general  rather than to specific individuals or things, consider using the same wording. Here are some strategies you might use. 

  - Use the word "the" in the noun phrase. 
  - Use the word "a" in the noun phrase. 
  - Use the word "any," as in "any person" or "anyone." 
  - Use the plural form, as in "people." 
  - Use any other way that is natural in your language.
