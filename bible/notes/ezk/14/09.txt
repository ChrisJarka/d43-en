<usfm> \v 9 And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, Yahweh, will deceive that prophet and I will stretch out my hand against him; and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. \v 10 And they will lift up their iniquity: the iniquity of the prophet shall be the same as the iniquity of him that inquires from him. \v 11 By this, the house of Israel will no longer wander away from following me nor defile themselves any longer through all their transgressions. They will be my people, and I will be their God.'â€“this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration!" </usfm>
