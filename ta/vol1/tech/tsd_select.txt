**Note:** The first time you use the application, translationStudio opens at the **Translation Projects** screen so you can select the target language. 

On the 'Your Translation Projects' screen:
  - Click the blue circle with a + sign
  - Scroll down (Click-and-hold on the dark gray square in the line to the right of the list) to find the target language or click the look-up icon located at the top right of the window. The look-up icon is a circle with a line that looks like a magnifying glass.
  - Type the first few letters of your language in the 'Choose target language' rectangle to show that portion of the language list.
  - Click on your language. 

You cannot find the desired target language? Then see [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_request]] for information on searching and requesting a new language.

  - Choose a project from the 'Bible: NT', 'Bible: OT' or 'Open Bible Stories' to start translating.
    - In the Bible: NT or Bible: OT projects you will need to then choose a book for the project.
    - An Open Bible Stories project will open to the first paragraph of The Creation.
  - The new translation project opens showing the 'Consume' section.
