===== Translation **Notes:** =====

  * This verse is a metaphor which references v29-30 that speaks of the idolatry(false gods) that Israel worshipped and how both the idols and their creator will be destroyed by God
  * **The strong man will be as tinder**- The rich and powerful man will be like kindling for the fire
  * **and his work as a spark**;- and what he produces ( an idol) is like a spark (to start the fire)
  * **they will both burn together**- both the man and his work will be consumed by the fire
  * **and no one will quench them**. - and no one can put out that fire because God has kindled it in judgment against the idolaters
