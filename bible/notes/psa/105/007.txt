===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **His decrees are on all the earth** - AT: "He rules and judges all the people of the earth"
    * **He keeps in mind his covenant forever, the word that he commanded for a thousand generations** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis; "word" refers to the covenant. AT: "He remembers his covenant forever, the promise he made for 1,000 generations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
