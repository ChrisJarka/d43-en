===== Description =====

Remember that nouns are words that refer to a person, place, thing, or idea. **ABSTRACT NOUNS** are nouns that refer to things that cannot be seen, heard, tasted, smelled or touched in a physical sense. Ideas and things like 'peace' are real, but cannot be seen or touched in a physical sense. 

**Examples of Abstract Nouns**: \\ joy, peace, creation, goodness, contentment, justice, attitude, freedom, vengeance\\
Hint: English uses common word endings (suffixes) that may help identify abstract nouns. They include such endings as: -tion; -ism; -ity; -ment; -ness; -age; -ance; -ence; -ship; -ability; -acy

Purpose (optional)\\

**Reason this is a translation issue**: The Bible that you translate from may use abstract nouns to express certain ideas. Your language might not use abstract nouns for some of those ideas; instead, it might use other kinds of words such as adjectives, verbs, or adverbs or even sentences to express them.

===== Examples from the Bible =====
===== Translation Strategies =====
If your language can use an abstract noun consider using it. These strategies are for if your language cannot use one.
  - If your language has an abstract noun that matches the meaning of the noun in the Bible, use it.
  - If your language has a verb or adjective that expresses the meaning of the noun, reword the sentence and use the verb or adjective.
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
**Two examples for Translation Suggestion 1**: \\
//from childhood you have known the sacred writings//  2 Tim 3:15\\
The abstract noun "childhood" can be translated with the concrete noun "child."
  * Ever since you were a child you have known the sacred writings.
  * Even when you were a child, you came to know the sacred writings.
//But godliness with contentment is great gain.//  1 Tim 6:6\\ 
The abstract nouns "godliness," contentment," and "gain" can be translated with adjectives such as "godly," "content," and "beneficial."
  * But being godly and content is very beneficial.
The idea of "gain" can also be translated with the verbs "benefit" or "help." Sometimes the words may need to be moved around to form a good sentence.
  * But we benefit greatly when we are godly and content.
  * Being godly and content helps us.
**Two examples for Translation Suggestion 2**: \\ 
//Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.//  Luke 19:9\\
The abstract noun "salvation" can be translated with the verb "save."
  * The people in this house have been saved...
Depending on how you reword this sentence, you may need to include the person who saves the people:
  * God has saved the people in this house...
//You have shown me great kindness in saving my life//  Genesis 19:19\\
The noun "kindness" can be translated with the adjective "kind."
  * You have been very kind to me by saving my life
The noun "life" can be translated with the verb "live."
  * You have shown me great kindness in saving me so that I might live.
