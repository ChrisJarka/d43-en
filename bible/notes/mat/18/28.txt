<usfm>
\v 28 But that servant went out and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him one hundred denarii. He grasped him, took him by the throat, and said, "Pay me what you owe."
\v 29 But his fellow-servant fell down and implored him, saying, "Have patience with me, and I will repay you."

===== Important Terms: =====

  * Denarii
  * Implored

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **grasped**  - means to "take hold of" or "grab" (UDB adds clarity)
  * **"but his fellow-servant fell down and implored him"**
 - Matthew is using irony to highlight the similarities between the two servants situations and contrast the master's response to the first servant and the first servant's response to his fellow servant.
