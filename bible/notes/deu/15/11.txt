  * [[:en:obe:other:hand]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:brother]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **open your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor** - The words "needy" and "poor" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that these are people who cannot help themselves. AT: "help your fellow Israelites who cannot help themselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **open your hand** - "help" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
