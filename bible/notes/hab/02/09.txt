===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to answer Habakkuk. He refers to the Chaldeans as though they are one person. 

  * **who carves out evil gains for his house** "who works to get dishonest profits for his family"
  * **set his nest on high** - "builds his house far from trouble"
  * **the hand of evil**  - This can be translated 1) "the hand of evil," treating "evil" as a person (See: [[en:ta:translate:personification]]) or 2) "evil people" (See: [[en:ta:translate:synecdoche]]).
  * **You have devised shame for your house by cutting off many people** - "Because you cut off many people, your family will be suffer shame"
  * **cutting off** - destroying (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]]
  * **sinned against your own soul** - "hurt yourself"
  * **stones will cry out from the wall...the rafters of timber will answer** - The people hurt in the building of the house, who will shout in anger, represent the people destroyed by the Chaldeans. (See: [[en:ta:translate:personification]] and [[en:ta:translate:idiom]] and [[en:ta:translate:synecdoche]])
  * ** them** - This means the people hurt to create the roof of his house will hear the others who have been hurt and join with them. (See: [[en:ta:translate:personification]]) (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])
