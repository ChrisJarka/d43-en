\v 23 Then when his disciples were alone with him, he turned toward them and said, "God has given you a great gift by letting you see the things that I have done!
\v 24 I want you to know that many prophets and kings who lived long ago desired to see the things that you are seeing me do, but they could not, because those things did not happen then. They longed to hear the things that you have been hearing me say, but I had not yet revealed those things at that time."

\v 23 And turning to the disciples, he said privately, "Blessed are those  who see the things that you see:
\v 24 for I say to you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things that you see, and did not see them; and to hear the things that you hear, and did not hear them.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **he said privetely**  - or, quietly. This suggests that the previous section was addressed to, or at least in the presence of, a much larger group.
    * **blessed are those who see the things that you see**- This is literally, "happy [are] the eyes which are seeing what you see." This could also be translated as "Those who see thing things that you see are truly happy." or "God has truly blessed you by letting you see the things you are seeing."
