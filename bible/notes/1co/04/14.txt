\v 14 I do not write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
\v 15 For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, you do not have many fathers because I have fathered you in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
\v 16 I strongly encourage you therefore, be imitators of me.
