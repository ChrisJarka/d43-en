\v 13 And a prophet wrote \add in\add* another \add Scripture passage what Christ said about God\add*,
\q I will trust him.
\p And in another \add Scripture passage, Christ said about those who are like his\add* children,
\q I and the ones that God has given me are here.


\p
\v 14 So, since those \add whom God calls his\add* children are all human beings \f + \ft metonymy \f*, Jesus also became a human being \add just like them\add*. The devil has the power to cause people \add to be afraid\add* to die, but Christ became human in order that by his dying he might make the devil powerless.
\v 15 \add Jesus did that\add* to free all of us who are like slaves \f + \ft metaphor \f* all the time we live, because we are \add forced to\add* be afraid to die.

\p
\v 13 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children whom God has given me.
\v 14 Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nothing him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
\v 15 and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
