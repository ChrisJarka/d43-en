\v 42 Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have
I come of myself, but he sent me.
\v 43 Why do you not understand my speech? Even because you cannot hear my word.
\v 44 You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the
beginning, and stands not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for
he is a liar, and the father thereof.
