\p
\v 16 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 17 Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them
warning from me.
\v 18 When I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him not warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from
his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.
\v 19 Yet if you warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity;
but you have delivered your soul.
