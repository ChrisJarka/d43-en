\v 17 Then the clans of Judah presented themselves, and Yahweh selected the clan of Zerah. Then the families of Zerah's clan presented themselves, and Yahweh indicated that he was selecting someone from the family of Zabdi.
\v 18 Then Joshua told the men from that family to present each member of their family, one at a time, so that the guilty person may be selected.
