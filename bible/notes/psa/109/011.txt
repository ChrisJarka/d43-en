===== Translation Notes: =====

David continues to ask God to punish a person who attacked him with his words and returned hatred for his love.
  * **the creditor** - someone who lends money to another person but expects that the person will pay the money back
  * **extend kindness to him** - It is implied that people would show kindness to him by being kind to his children. AT: "continue to show kindness to him, by being kind to his children." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **his fatherless children** - "his children whose father has died"
  * **May his descendants be cut off** - AT: "May all of his descendants die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **may their name be blotted out in the next generation** - The name of a person represents the memory of that person which is carried on by the descendants of that person. AT: "in the next generation, may people not remember his descendants because they have died and had no children." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
