\v 17 Groan quietly; do not cry openly for her. Keep your turban wrapped around your head, and \add instead of being barefoot\add*, keep your sandals on your feet. Do not cover the lower part of your face \add to show that you are sad\add*. And do not eat the kind of food that people who are mourning usually eat."

\v 15 Also the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 16 Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet you shall neither mourn nor weep,
neither shall your tears run down.
\v 17 Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind your headtire upon thee, and put your shoes upon your feet, and
cover not your lips, and eat not the bread of men.
