\v 9 But when the people of the land shall come before Jehovah in the appointed feasts, he that enters by the way of the
north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that enters by the way of the south gate shall go
forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth straight
before him.
\v 10 And the prince, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they shall go forth
together.
