\c 5
\q
\v 1 “Rush about through the streets of Jerusalem, then look and think about this. Search in her city squares, too.
\q If you can find a man or anyone who is acting justly and seeking the truth,
\q then I will forgive Jerusalem.
\q
\v 2 Even if they are saying, ‘Yahweh lives,’ they are making false oaths.
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, do your eyes not look for truth? You strike the people, but they do not feel pain.
\q You have completely defeated them, but they still refuse to receive discipline. They make their faces harder than cliff sides, for they refuse to repent.
