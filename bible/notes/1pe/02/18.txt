===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 18 Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
\v 19 For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endures griefs, suffering wrongfully.
\v 20 For what glory is it, if, when you sin, and are buffeted for it, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.
