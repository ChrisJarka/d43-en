====== Simon of Joppa ======

.

===== Facts: =====

This Simon was a believer living in the city of Joppa who hosted Simon Peter in his home while Peter preached the gospel in that city.

  * Simon's work was to tan animal skins to make leather, which was used to make many different things such as sandals, water bottles, books and bags to hold wine.
  * This man could be referred to as "Simon the tanner" if needed to distinguish him from the other Simons in the New Testament, or his name could be spelled slightly differently.
  * While Peter was staying with Simon, a centurion named Cornelius came to see him. Through a vision, God had prepared Peter to welcome this Gentile man.
