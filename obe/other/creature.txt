====== creature ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "creature" refers generally to all the living beings that God created, both humans and animals.

  * The prophet Ezekiel described seeing "living creatures" in his vision of the glory of God. He did not know what they were so he could not assign any specific definition to them.
  * The term can be used as a generic description of all of God's living animal creation that is non-human; as in "all God's creatures."
