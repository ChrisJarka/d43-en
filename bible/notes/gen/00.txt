**What is “Genesis”?**

“Genesis” means “in the beginning,” and answers the question, where do we come from? Genesis is the account of how God brought creation into existence out of nothing. The story of creation tells us that God made a perfect home for man where he would reveal himself to human beings. 

**What is Genesis about?**

Much of Genesis is about how human beings were made by God and the purpose of human life.  God relates to us and to all creation through [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenants]] that he has made. Human beings are different from animals because God gave us some of his qualities and abilities.\\

Genesis is a record of God’s mighty acts, the beginning of human life, and how [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] brought [[:en:obe:kt:death|death]] and separation between people and God. Yet Genesis gives us hope and tells us about God’s ultimate promise to [[:en:obe:kt:save|save]] us. 

**Who wrote Genesis?**

The Bible tells us that Moses composed the book of Genesis. The writers of both the Old and New Testament confirm his part in the composition of the book of Genesis. Ultimately, one can say that God is the author of Genesis because he inspired Moses’s writings.

**What are the different parts of Genesis?**\\

Genesis 1–11 is an account of the early years of creation. It tells about Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the Flood, the Tower of Babel, and the beginnings of the different ethnic groups. It very briefly records significant events occurring over a period of several thousand years.\\

Genesis 12–50 focuses on the special relationship God began with Abraham and his descendants. God established a covenant that contained certain promises for Abraham and his descendants. It is on the foundation of this covenant that Abraham’s descendants, who would be known as the Hebrews or Israelites, would come to worship Yahweh. The longest section in Genesis is about Joseph, one of Jacob’s sons, who is the key figure in Genesis 38–50.  Genesis ends with Abraham’s descendants living in Egypt with an expectation of a return to the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland]]. \\

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**What are the covenants mentioned in Genesis?**

There are three covenants mentioned in Genesis. The covenant with Adam involved God’s instruction to not eat of the knowledge of good and evil. The punishment for disobedience was death. The covenant God made with Noah was a promise to never again destroy the world with a flood. In the covenant with Abraham, God promised to bless him, make him a great nation and the father of many nations, bless those who bless him and curse those who curse him, and promised a specific area of land for his descendants.

**What was God's purpose for the book of Genesis?**

The book of Genesis says that a perfect God created a perfect world. However, the world became imperfect because human beings began to [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]]. But God is shown to continue to have complete control over the world.

Genesis also describes the start of God's plan to win the sinful world back to himself. An important event in this process occurred when God created a special relationship by means of a covenant with Abraham and his descendants.

**What was the custom for [[:en:obe:kt:inherit|inheritance]] as described by Genesis?**

The cultural concepts of inheritance and of the passing on of a father's [[:en:obe:kt:bless|blessing]] are very significant in Genesis. The blessing that Abraham passed on to his son Isaac placed him as an ancestor of the people of Israel. This is unlike the experience of Ishmael, Abraham's other son, who did not receive that same divine blessing. Likewise, Isaac's older son Esau foolishly gave up the same blessing, which his younger brother Jacob received instead.

Additionally, it was customary for a man to divide among his sons his material wealth and land. All his sons received equal portions, except that the oldest son received twice as much. The oldest son's portion was called a double portion. Esau also gave this up.

**How does Genesis present sin and evil?**

Ancient Near Eastern societies, like many societies today, view sin and disasters of all kinds as if they were physical dirt, or rottenness, that could spread among people, throughout their communities, and even their land. As a result, many societies have very little trouble in appreciating the Genesis account of how sin was introduced into the world.

These societies also assume that the way to stop the spread of evil is to perform sacrifices. For this reason, many societies still today easily understand the reason for the animal sacrifices of which Genesis speaks.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**What is one way in which Genesis marks the beginning of important sections?**

Genesis uses one Hebrew phrase that the ULB translates as either, "this is the record of...," "these are the events concerning...," or "these are the descendants of...." The information in these sections came perhaps from sources much older than Moses himself.

If the translator wants to translate in only one way, we recommend a phrase such as, "this is the record about..." or "this is information about...." This Hebrew phrase occurs in Gen. 5:1; 10:1; 11:10; 25:12; 36:1, and 37:2.

**Why is the start of some narrative sections in Genesis difficult to translate?** \\
This is because Hebrew style often prefers to give a statement at the beginning that summarizes the following narrative. Many other languages, however, cannot easily translate this.

**Are the places named in Genesis still in the same places today?** \\
The geography of the world changed after the flood. The location of places today may differ from their location in Genesis. For example, like the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in Eden may not be the same rivers known today as the Tigris and Euphrates.

**What is the difference between the names of people and people groups?**

Because many of the people in Genesis eventually had large numbers of descendants who lived in a specific area, their ancestors began to be known by their name. For example, Cush was both a person and an area where his descendants formed a nation. The descendants of Esau become known as the Edomites. If possible, when translating these names, there should be a noticeable connection between these individuals and the nations or people groups which arose from their descendants.
