===== Translation Notes: =====

The Lord is speaking to Isaiah
  * **Make the heart of this people calloused** - "Make this people have a hard heart." Alternate translation: "Make it so the people are not willing to listen to what I say." 
  * **this people** - "the people of Judah and Jerusalem"
  * **and make their ears deaf, and blind their eyes** - "and make it so that they cannot hear, and make it so that they cannot see." This means make the people spiritually deaf and blind. They will be able to physically see and hear, but they will be unable to recognize the truth of what God is saying and doing.
  * **and then turn again** - "and follow me again."
  * **and be healed** - Alternative translation: "and I would heal them." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
