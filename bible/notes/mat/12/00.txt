======  Matthew 12 General Notes ======


=== Formatting in this chapter ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of verses 18-21, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Sabbath ==

Obedience to the [[:en:obe:kt:sabbath|Sabbath]] is an important part of this chapter. Jesus differentiates between following the Sabbath the way God commanded and the rules the Pharisees created about the Sabbath.

== Blasphemy against the Spirit ==

There is a great deal of controversy regarding properly identifying this specific [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]]. The UDB says, God "will not forgive those who say evil things about what the Holy Spirit does." This could imply that everything said against the Holy Spirit is unforgivable. This conclusion is improbable. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==

There are many [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphors]] in this chapter. This is possibly because these teachings were intended to be applicable to many different situations or to conceal the exactly how [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophecies]] were to be fulfilled in the future. It was also common at that time to use analogies and metaphors in one's teaching.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Brother and Sisters ==
This chapter introduces the concept of "spiritual" [[:en:obe:kt:brother|brothers]] and sisters. Scripture uses these terms to refer to relationship between children who share a biological parent and to describe the relationship between fellow Israelites. Here, those who follow Jesus are now referred to as "brothers" and "sisters."
