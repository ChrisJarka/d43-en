<usfm>
\v 7 Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.
\v 8 There is one that is alone, and he has not a second; yea, he has neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, says he, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.
