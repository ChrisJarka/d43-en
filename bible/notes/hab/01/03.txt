===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 Why do you make me watch people do what is wrong, but you do nothing?
\q1 I see people destroying things and acting violently; they fight and quarrel everywhere.
\q1
\v 4 No one obeys the law of Moses, and no one acts in a right way for very long.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 3 Why do you make me see iniquity and look upon wrongdoing?
\q Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and contention rises up.
\q
\v 4 Therefore the law is weakened, and justice does not last for any time.
\q For the wicked surround the righteous; therefore false justice goes out."
</usfm>
