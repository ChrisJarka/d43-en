\v 1 Dear friends, many people \add who have a false message\add* are teaching it to people \f + \ft metonymy \f*. So do not trust every \add message that someone claims\f + \ft Or: says \f* that God's\add* Spirit \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add gave to him\add*. Instead, test\f + \ft Or: think carefully about \f* the teachings that \add you hear\add* in order to know whether they are from God or not.
\v 2 \add I will tell\add* you how to recognize \add teachings that come from\add* the Spirit of God: Those who affirm\f + \ft Or: say \f* that Jesus Christ came \add from God\add* to become a human \add like us\add* are \add teaching a message\add* that is from God.
\v 3 But those who do not affirm\f + \ft Or: say \f* \add that about\add* Jesus are not \add teaching a message\add* from God. \add They are teachers who\add* oppose Christ. You have heard that people like that are coming \add to be among us\add*. Even now they are already here!

\v 1 Dear friends, many people who have a false message are teaching it to people  the teachings that you hear in order to know whether they are from God or not.
\v 2 I will tell you how to recognize teachings that come from the Spirit of God: Those who affirm that Jesus Christ came from God to become a human like us are teaching a message that is from God.
\v 3 But those who do not affirm that about Jesus are not teaching a message from God. They are teachers who oppose Christ. You have heard that people like that are coming to be among us. Even now they are already here!

\v 1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
\v 2 Hereby know you the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
\v 3 and every spirit that confesses not Jesus is not of God: and this is the spirit of the antichrist, whereof you have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already.
