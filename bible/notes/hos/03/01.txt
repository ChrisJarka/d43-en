\c 3
\p
\v 1 And Jehovah said to me, Go again, love a woman beloved of
her friend, and an adulteress, even as Jehovah loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love cakes of raisins.
\v 2 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;
\v 3 and I said to her, You shall abide for me many days; you shall not play the harlot, and you shall not be any manâ€™s wife: so will I also be toward thee.
