\v 21 Although this temple is now greatly respected, when that happens, all the people who pass by will be appalled, and they will say, 'Why has Yahweh done terrible things like this to this country and to this temple?'
\v 22 And others will reply, 'It happened because they rejected Yahweh, the God to whom their ancestors belonged, the one who brought their ancestors out of Egypt, and they have been worshiping other gods and trying to please them. And that is why Yahweh has caused them to experience all these disasters.'~"

\v 21 And this house, which is so high, every one that passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, 'Why has Yahweh done
thus to this land, and to this house?'
\v 22 And they shall answer, 'Because they forsook Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of
Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore has he brought all this evil upon them.'"
