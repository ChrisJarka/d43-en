\v 1 Therefore, do not act maliciously in any way or deceive others. Do not be hypocrites, and do not envy others. Do not ever speak evil about anyone untruthfully.
\v 2 Just as newborn babies long for their mothers' pure milk, you should desire to learn true things from God, so that by learning it you may become like adults in trusting him. You must do this until the time when God sets you completely free from all the evil in this world.
\v 3 Also, you must do this because you have experienced that the Lord acts very kindly toward you.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter continues teaching his readers about holiness and obedience.

  * **Therefore put aside** - To "put aside" something is to get rid of it or stop doing it. The word "Therefore" here refers back to everything he has said about being holy and obedient. AT: "So then, get rid of" or "So then, stop doing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **As newborn infants, long for pure spiritual milk** - Peter speaks of his readers as if they are babies. Just as babies require proper nourishment to grow, so, too, do believers. AT: "Just as babies long for their mother's breast milk, so you must yearn for pure spiritual milk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **long for** - "desire intensely" or "yearn for"
  * **pure spiritual milk** - Peter speaks of the word of God as if it were spiritual milk that nourishes spiritual babies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you may grow in salvation** - Here the word "salvation" refers to when God brings the salvation of his people to completion when Jesus returns. You can translate this with a verbal phrase. AT: "you may grow up spiritually until God saves you completely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **if you have tasted that the Lord is kind** - Here to taste means to experience something personally. AT: "if you have experienced the Lord's kindness towards you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
