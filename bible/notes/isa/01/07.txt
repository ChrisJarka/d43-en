===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Your country is desolate**- Isaiah continues the metaphor from 1:5-6. Here he shows Judah is like a wounded man because their land is in ruins. "There is no one left in the countryside."
  * **your fieldsâ€“in your presence, strangers are destroying them**- "People who are not from your own country steal the crops in your fields while you watch"
  * **a waste and desolation** - This could be translated as "the land is destroyed and no one lives there."
  * **as overthrown by strangers**- This compares the destruction in Judah to what a land looks like after an enemy's army has conquered it. This can be translated with an active verb: "like a foreign army has completely conquered it." (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]] and [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **The daughter of Zion**- Isaiah refers to Zion or Jerusalem as the daughter of God. This emphasizes that God still loves the people of the city even though he has to punish them for their sins. This could be translated as "Zion" or "the city of Jerusalem" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:translate:personification]])
  * **is left as a hut in a vineyard** - Isaiah is comparing 

**The daughter of Zion is left as a hut in a vineyard as a shed in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged city** These metaphors illustrate the dangerous situation in which the nation Israel is in. [[(See: Metaphor)]]
  * **a hut ... a shed**- These are metaphors for an unstable shelter.
  * **a besieged city**- "a city that is surrounded by enemies"
