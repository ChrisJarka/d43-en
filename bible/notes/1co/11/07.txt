\v 7 Men should not wear coverings over their heads \add when they pray or speak messages that God gave them\add*, because they represent what God is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* and they show how great God is. But women show how great men \f + \ft Or: their husbands \f* are.
\v 8 \add Remember that God intends that men have authority over women. We know that\add* because \add God\add* did not make \add the first\add* man, \add Adam\add*, from the \add first\add* woman, \add Eve\add*. Instead, he made that woman \add from a bone that he took\add* from the man.
