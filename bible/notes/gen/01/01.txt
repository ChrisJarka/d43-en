===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **bold words**  - explanation
  * **In the beginning**  - before humans and creation existed; in the beginning of the world
  * **created **- This is a theological term unique to God. It describes the initial act of making something new. It is the divine act of bringing something into existence.
  * **the heavens and the earth **- "heavens" is always expressed in the plural. These words are often paired together to express completeness. In other words, God created "everything".
  * **without form and empty **- The world was in chaos and God had not yet ordered it, given it a purpose and a function. According to the Greek it was "unseen" and "unconstructed".
  * **bold**  - explanation
  * **waters**  - In Hebrew, the word for "water" is always expressed as a plural word. If your language does not do this, or it would be confusing to use the plural, simply "the water" is another way to translate this word.
