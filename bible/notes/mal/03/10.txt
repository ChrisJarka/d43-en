\v 10 Bring you the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, says
Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room
enough to receive it.
\v 11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your
vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, says Jehovah of hosts.
\v 12 And all nations shall call you happy; for you shall be a delightsome land, says Jehovah of hosts.
