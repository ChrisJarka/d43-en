===== Translation Notes: =====

(These verses are a continuation of Ezekiel's lament (oracle) to the King of Egypt, meaning the Egypt nation.)

  * **<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>For I will give your flesh to the mountains</font>    and fill the valleys with your corpsses **- "The mountains and the valleys will be filled with your dead bodies." This metaphor shows the extent to which Yahweh will completely destroy the people to the extent that their body parts will be scattered and divided. (See: Metaphor) This shows the extent of God's judgment. (See: Hyperbole)
  * **<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Then I will irrigate the land of your infection up to the mountains with your blood,</font>    **- "Your bodies, bones, and blood will be spread out through the land"
  * **And the stream beds will be filled with you! **- "and the canals and rivers where water runs will be filled with human parts." This personification shows how, after God's judgment, he will leave a reminder to other peoples and nations.
