\c 16
\d Michtam of David.
\q
\v 1 Preserve me, O God; for in you do I take refuge.
\q
\v 2 O my soul, you have said to Jehovah, You are my Lord:
\q I have no good beyond thee.
\q
\v 3 As for the saints that are in the earth,
\q They are the excellent in whom is all my delight.
\q
\v 4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that give gifts for another
god:
\q Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer,
\q Nor take their names upon my lips.
\q
\v 5 Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
\q You maintainest my lot.
\q
\v 6 The lines are fallen to me in pleasant places;
\q Yea, I have a goodly heritage.
\q
\v 7 I will bless Jehovah, who has given me counsel;
\q Yea, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.
\q
\v 8 I have set Jehovah always before me:
\q Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
\q
\v 9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth:
\q My flesh also shall dwell in safety.
\q
\v 10 For you will not leave my soul to Sheol;
\q Neither will you suffer your holy one to see corruption.
\q
\v 11 You will show me the path of life:
\q In your presence is fulness of joy;
\q In your right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
