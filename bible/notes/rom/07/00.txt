====== Romans 07 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== "Or do you not know" ==
This is a narrative marker that shifts the topic of the discussion, but it does so in a way that connects with the previous teaching. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Fruit ==
The imagery of fruit is used in this chapter. The image of fruit is usually the outworking of one's faith in producing acts of [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteousness]] in a person's life. Here it is used to talk about the positive result of Paul's future visit to Rome in the lives of the Roman Christians.

== "We have been released from the law" ==
Paul explains that the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]] is no longer in effect. While this is true, the principles behind the law are a reflection of the character of God and are timeless. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Marriage ==
Marriage is a common [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] used in Scripture. Here it is used to describe the church's relationship to the law of Moses.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Flesh ==
This is a complex issue and it is possible that "flesh" is a metaphor for a person's sinful nature. It is not the physical part of man that is sinful and it appears that Paul is teaching that while man remains alive ("in the flesh"), he will remain sinful regardless of his effort, but his new nature will be fighting against his old nature.
