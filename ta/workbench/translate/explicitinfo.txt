====== Making Implicit Information Explicit ======

This page answers the question:  What can I do if the target language speakers do not know some important information that the original speaker or writer left implicit? 

In order to understand this page, it would be good to read

==== Description ====

Sometimes translators need to make implicit information explicit because of the requirements of their language. For example, some languages require an object with the verbs "eat" and "drink." They need to say what someone eats or drinks, even if they don't know exactly what he ate or drank.

> Therefore, whether __you eat or drink__, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. (1 Corinthians 10:31 ULB) \\ 

  * "Therefore, whether __you eat food or drink something__, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."

Sometimes translators need to make implicit information explicit because their readers would not understand the original speaker's or author's message.  

**Reason this is a translation issue**
  * Sometimes the words or grammar of the target language requires that certain information be stated explicitly.
  * Readers may not understand the message if they do not know certain information that the original speakers and hearers knew.
  * Readers might misunderstand the meaning of something because of differences between the Bible culture and their own.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

1. Sometimes the words or grammar of the target language requires that certain information be stated explicitly.

> Therefore, whether __you eat or drink__, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. (1 Corinthians 10:31 ULB) \\ 

Some languages require an object with the verbs "eat" and "drink." They need a word or phrase that tells what someone eats or drinks, even if it is not important what they ate or drank.

2. Readers may not understand the message if they do not know certain information that the original speakers and hearers knew.

>it will be more tolerable for __Tyre and Sidon__  at the day of judgment than for you  (Matthew 11:22 ULB)

The original listeners understood that when Jesus spoke about the judgment, he was speaking about how God would judge and punish people for what they have done wrong. They also knew that the people of Tyre and Sidon were very wicked, and they believed that they were better than the people of Tyre and Sidon. Modern readers might not know these things.

3. Readers might misunderstand the meaning of something because of differences between the Bible culture and their own.

>Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not wash their hands when they eat__. (Matthew 15:2 ULB)

Modern readers could think that tradition of washing their hands when eating was to keep from getting sick. But for the Jews, it was a ritual to make themselves ceremonially clean before God.

==== Translation Strategies ==== 

  - If the words or grammar of the target language requires certain information, then state that information clearly.
  - If readers would need to know certain implied information in order to understand the message, then state that information clearly.
  - If readers would misunderstand the meaning of something because of differences between the Bible culture and their own, then state the meaning clearly.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. If the words or grammar of the target language requires certain information, then state that information clearly.

  * **Therefore, whether __you eat or drink__, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.** (1 Corinthians 10:31 ULB) - Some languages require an object with the verbs "eat" and "drink." 
    * "Therefore, whether __you eat food or drink something__, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."

2. If readers would need to know certain implied information in order to understand the message, then state that information clearly.

  * **it will be more tolerable for __Tyre and Sidon__  at the day of judgment than for you**  (Matthew 11:22 ULB)
      * "God will punish __Tyre and Sidon, cities whose people you think of as very wicked,__  less severely than he will punish you"

  * **Jesus said to him, "Foxes __have holes__, and the birds of the sky __have nests__, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."**  (Matthew 8:20 ULB)
      * "Jesus said to him, "Foxes __have holes to live in__, and the birds of the sky __have nests to live in__, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head and sleep.""

3. If readers would misunderstand the meaning of something because of differences between the Bible culture and their own, then state the meaning clearly.
  * **Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not wash their hands__  when they eat.**  (Matthew 15:2 ULB)
      * "Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not go through the ceremonial handwashing ritual__  when they eat."
