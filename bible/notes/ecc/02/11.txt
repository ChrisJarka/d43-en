\v 11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had made, and on the labor that I had done; and, behold, all was vapor and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
\v 12 And I looked at wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can a man do, that comes after the king,  that has not already been done.
