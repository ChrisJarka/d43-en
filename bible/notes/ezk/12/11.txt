\v 11 Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.
\v 12 And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through
the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.
\v 13 My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the
Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
