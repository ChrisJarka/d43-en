\v 3 There was seen another sign in the heavens. Behold, it was a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.
\v 4 His tail drew down a third part of the stars in the heavens and cast them to the earth. Then the dragon stood before the woman that was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.
