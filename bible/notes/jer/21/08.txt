===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 And tell this to all the people: 'Yahweh says that you must decide whether you want to die or to remain alive.
\v 9 Everyone who remains in Jerusalem will die. They will be killed in battles or die from being hungry or from diseases. But those who surrender to the army of Babylon that is surrounding your city will remain alive. They will escape dying.
\v 10 This will happen because I, Yahweh, have decided to cause this city to experience disasters, not to experience something good. The army of the king of Babylon will capture this city and will destroy it completely by fire.'~"

\v 8 “Then to this peo0ple you will say, ‘Thus says Yahweh: Behold! I am setting before you is the way of life and the way of death.
\v 9 The one abiding in this city will die by the sword, famine, and plague; but the one going out and falling before the Chaldeans who have closed in against you will live and his life will be his spoil!’
\v 10 For I have set my face against this city for calamity and not for good.—This is Yahweh’s declaration—It is given to the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire!
