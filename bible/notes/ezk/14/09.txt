\v 9 If a prophet is deceived and speaks a message, then I, Yahweh, will deceive that prophet; I will stretch out my hand
against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
\v 10 And they will carry their own iniquity; the iniquity of the prophet will be the same as the iniquity of the one who inquires from him.
\v 11 Because of this, the house of Israel will no longer wander away from following me nor defile themselves any longer through all 
their transgressions. They will be my people, and I will be their God.' This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration!"
