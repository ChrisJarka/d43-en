====== Pentecost, Festival of Weeks ======

===== Facts: =====

The "Festival of Weeks" was a Jewish festival that took place fifty days after Passover. It was later referred to as "Pentecost."

  * The Feast of Weeks was seven weeks (fifty days) after the Feast of Firstfruits. In the New Testament times, this festival was called "pentecost" which has "fifty" as part of its meaning.
  * The Festival of Weeks was held to celebrate the beginning of the grain harvest. It was also a time to remember when God first gave the Law to the Israelites on the tablets of stone given to Moses.
  * In the New Testament, the Day of Pentecost is especially significant because it was on this day that God poured out the Holy Spirit on Jesus' followers after Jesus had risen from the dead and gone back to heaven.
