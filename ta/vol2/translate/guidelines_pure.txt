Being PURE when translating the Bible means that: When a word has multiple meanings, you translate the meaning of the word as the author intended it in its original context. Avoid any personal interpretation or bias.
Translate the meaning of a word for the specific situation when the word has multiple meanings, avoiding any personal interpretation or viewpoint.
A single word can have multiple meanings in different situations, depending on the intent of the original writer.  One example would be the English word “soft”. Soft can mean the texture or hardness of object or it can mean kinds of emotions.   Be careful to use simple, clear vocabulary in your translation when possible.  
Follow your resources such as **[[en:bible:notes:home|Translation Notes]]**, **[[en:obe:home|Important Words]]** and the **[[en:udb:home|Unfolding Word Dynamic Bible]]** to know what was intended by the original author.  This will give you a good idea of how to express the word or phrase in your language.
Choose the meaning intended by the original author; the one that best fits the situation.  Then, translate the word or phrase using the main sense of the word in your language.  
Avoid adding any personal information that you want people to know.  The Bible was written a long time ago, but the message God gave to the people of that time will speak to the hearts of our people today.  It is good for people to understand the meaning that was intended for the audience when it was written.  It is not necessary for you to add any personal viewpoints that apply to today’s situation.
Remember the Bible is God’s timeless message.  Translate the meaning of a word for the specific situation when the word has multiple meanings, avoiding any personal interpretation or viewpoint.
