\c 24
\p
\v 1 And Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way; and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of
the temple.
\v 2 But he answered and said to them, See you not all these things? verily I say to you, There shall not be left here one
stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
\p
\v 3 And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be?
and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?
\v 4 And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man lead you astray.
\v 5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and shall lead many astray.
\v 6 And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you be not troubled: for
these things must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet.
\v 7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines and earthquakes in various
places.
\v 8 But all these things are the beginning of travail.
\v 9 Then shall they deliver you up to tribulation, and shall kill you: and you shall be hated of all the nations for my
name’s sake.
\v 10 And then shall many stumble, and shall deliver up one another, and shall hate one another.
\v 11 And many false prophets shall arise, and shall lead many astray.
\v 12 And because iniquity shall be multiplied, the love of the many shall wax cold.
\v 13 But he that endures to the end, the same shall be saved.
\v 14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations; and then shall
the end come.
\p
\v 15 When therefore you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy
place (let him that readeth understand),
\v 16 then let them that are in Judaea flee to the mountains:
\v 17 let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house:
\v 18 and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak.
\v 19 But woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!
\v 20 And pray you that your flight be not in the winter, neither on a sabbath:
\v 21 for then shall be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall
be.
\v 22 And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be
shortened.
\v 23 Then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is the Christ, or, Here; believe
it not.
\v 24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so as to lead astray, if
possible, even the elect.
\v 25 Behold, I have told you beforehand.
\v 26 If therefore they shall say to you, Behold, he is in the wilderness; go not forth: Behold, he is in the inner chambers;
believe it not.
\v 27 For as the lightning comes forth from the east, and is seen even to the west; so shall be the coming of the Son of
man.
\v 28 Wherever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
\p
\v 29 But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and
the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
\v 30 and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they
shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
\v 31 And he shall send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the
four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
\p
\v 32 Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that
the summer is nigh;
\v 33 even so you also, when you see all these things, know you that he is nigh,
even at the doors.
\v 34 Verily I say to you, This generation shall not pass away, till all these things be accomplished.
\v 35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
\v 36 But of that day and hour knows no one, not even the angels of heaven, neither the Son, but the Father only.
\v 37 And as were the days of Noah, so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
\v 38 For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until
the day that Noah entered into the ark,
\v 39 and they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
\v 40 Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left:
\v 41 two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.
\v 42 Watch therefore: for you know not on what day your Lord cometh.
\v 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, and
would not have suffered his house to be broken through.
\v 44 Therefore be you also ready; for in an hour that you think not the Son of man cometh.
\p
\v 45 Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due
season?
\v 46 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.
\v 47 Verily I say to you, that he will set him over all that he hath.
\v 48 But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord tarrieth;
\v 49 and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken;
\v 50 the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knows not,
\v 51 and shall cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of
teeth.
