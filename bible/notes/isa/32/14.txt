\v 14 The king's palace will be empty;
\q2 there will be no people in the city that now is very noisy.
\q1 Wild donkeys will walk around and flocks of sheep will eat grass
\q2 in the empty forts and watchtowers.
\q1
\v 15 It will be like that until God pours his Spirit out on us from heaven.
\q2 When that happens, the deserts will become fertile fields,
\q2 and abundant crops will grow in those fertile fields.

\q1
\v 14 For the palace will be forsaken, the crowded city will be deserted; 
\q1 the hill and the watchtower will become caves forever, 
\q1 a joy of wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks;
\q1
\v 15 until the Spirit is poured on us from on high, 
\q1 and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is considered as a forest.
