\v 1 Long ago God communicated frequently to our ancestors in various ways by what the prophets said and wrote.
\v 2 But now when this final age is beginning, God has communicated to us by what his Son Jesus said and did. God sent his Son because he possesses everything that truly belongs to God. By his Son God even created the universe.
\v 3 God's Son Jesus is the light of God's powerful brilliance. He shows exactly what God is truly like because He is God, the Son. He sustains everything that exists by his word of power by which he created the universe. After he had cleansed us from our sins he sat down at the place of honor with God the Father in heaven where he rules with powerful justice alongside the Father.

\v 1  Long ago God spoke to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in many ways.
\v 2 Now in these last days God has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed as the heir of all things and  through whom he also made the universe.
\v 3 His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very character of his essence, and he sustains all things by the word of his power. After he had purified us from our sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.
