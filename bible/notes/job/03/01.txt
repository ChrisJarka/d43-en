===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **opened his mouth **- "began to speak"
  * **Let the day on which I was born perish **- This is figurative language. It is like saying "I wish that I had never been born."
  * **the day … the night**  - Both day and night could refer to the day of Job's birth (ULB). However, "the day" may refer to the day of his birth and "the night" to the day of his conception.
  * **the night that said, ‘A boy has been born' **- This is the second line of a two line poetic unit. So one needs to supply the verb from the previous line. One could translate this as "Let the night that said, 'A boy has been born', perish."
  * **the night that said**  - In reality the night does not speak; people do. This is a poetic way of saying "the night of which people said."
  * **A boy has been born**  - or "A man child has been conceived." This word "born" differs from the "born" in the first part of the verse. The word means "to be conceived" so may refer to the night of his conception, not his birth. One could also translate "she has conceived a man child."
