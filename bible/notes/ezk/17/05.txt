\v 5 He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters; he set it as a
willow-tree.
\v 6 And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were
under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
