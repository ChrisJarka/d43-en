====== Galatians 04:17-18 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Those \add who are insisting on obeying Jewish rules\add* are eagerly \add showing interest in\add* you, but \add what they are doing is\add* not good. They even want you not to associate with \add me and other true\add* believers, because they want you to eagerly show \add interest in\add* them, \add not in us\add*.
\v 18 But \add just like\add* it always feels good to have others show that they appreciate you, \add I would like you\add* always \add to appreciate me\add*, and not only when I am with you.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Those who are insisting on obeying the Jewish laws are trying to get you to follow them, but they are not doing it for your good. They want to keep you away from me, because they want you to follow them, not me.
\v 18 It is good if the right people want very much to teach you, if it is for the right reason--this is always good, whether or not I am present with you. But make sure it is the right people who are teaching you!
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 They passionately seek you, but for no good. They want to separate you from me so you will follow them.
\v 18 It is good to want very much for you to follow them, if it is for the right reason, but all the time and not only when I am present with you.
</usfm>

  * **It is good to want**  - "It is good that they want"
