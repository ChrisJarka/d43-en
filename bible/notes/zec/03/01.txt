\v 1 Then \add Yahweh\add* showed me Joshua, the Supreme Priest, who was standing in front of the angel that Yahweh had sent. And Satan was standing at Joshua's right side, ready to accuse him.
\v 2 But Yahweh said to Satan, "Satan, I am rebuking you! I am the one who has chosen Jerusalem \add to be my special city\add*, and I am rebuking you! This man, \add Joshua\add*, \add has been brought back from Babylonia\add*; he is surely like \f + \ft metaphor, rhetorical question \f* a burning stick that has been snatched from a fire."

\v 1 And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be
his adversary.
\v 2 And Jehovah said to Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan; yea, Jehovah that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not
this a brand plucked out of the fire?
\v 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.
