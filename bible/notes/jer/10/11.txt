\p
\v 11 Thus shall you say to them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth,
and from under the heavens.
\v 12 He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding has he
stretched out the heavens.
\v 13 When he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends
of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries.
