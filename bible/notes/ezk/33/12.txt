IAnd if righteous people start to sin, they will not be allowed to remain alive because of their formerly being righteous.

\v 12 And thou, son of man, say to the children of your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in
the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turns
from his wickedness; neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth.
\v 13 When I say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of
his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his iniquity that he has committed, therein shall he die.
