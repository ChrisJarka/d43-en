\q
\v 23 Concerning Damascus: â€œHamath and Arpad will be ashamed, for they have heard news of calamity!
\q They melt away! There is anxiety on the sea; it is not able to remain silent!
\q
\v 24 Damascus has sunk, it turns away to flee and terror seizes it!
\q Distress seizes it, travails like a woman giving birth!
\q
\v 25 How is the city of praise, the village of my joy, not abandoned?
