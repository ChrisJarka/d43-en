<usfm>
\v 16 Pay attention to yourselves, so that your heart is not deceived, and you turn aside and worship other gods, and bow down to them;
\v 17 so that the anger of Yahweh is not kindled against you, and so that he does not shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain, and the land will not yield its fruit, and so that you perish quickly from off the good land that Yahweh is giving you.

===== translationNotes: =====
Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **Pay attention to yourselves** - AT: "Be careful" or "Beware"
  * **so that your heart is not deceived** - The deception is thinking that they can worship other gods and Yahweh would not become angry. AT: "so that you do not deceive yourselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **so that the anger of Yahweh is not kindled against you** - Moses compares Yahweh's anger to someone starting a fire. This emphasizes Yahweh's power to destroy what makes him angry. AT: "so that Yahweh does not become angry with you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **so that he does not shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain** - AT: "so that he does not cause the rain to stop falling from the sky" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
