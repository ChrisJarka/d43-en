<usfm> \v 3 He taught them using many parables. He said, "Listen! A man went out to his field to sow seeds. \v 4 As he was scattering the seeds over the soil, some of the seeds fell on the path. But some birds came and ate those seeds. \v 5 Other seeds fell on ground where there was not much soil on top of the rock. Those seeds sprouted very soon, because the sun quickly warmed the shallow soil. \v 6 But when the young plants came up, they became too hot in the sunlight, and they dried up because they did not have deep roots. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

He said, "Behold, a sower went out to sow. \v 4 As he sowed, some seeds fell on the wayside, and the birds came and devoured them. \v 5 Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil. Immediately they sprang up, because the soil had no depth. \v 6 But when the sun had risen, they were scorched because they had no root, and they withered away. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to sit in a boat near the beach and tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * **Jesus said many things to them in parables **- "Jesus told them many things in parables"
  * **to them**  - The pronoun "them" refers to the people in the crowd.
  * **Behold **- "Listen!" (UDB)
  * **A sower went out to sow **- This can be translated as “A farmer went out to scatter some seeds in a field.”
  * **to sow**  - "to sow seeds" or "to sow grain"
  * **As he sowed **- The word "he" refers to the sower.
  * **wayside**  - “road” or “path.” The ground would have been hard from the people walking on it.
  * **devoured them **- "ate them all"
  * **Immediately they sprang up**  - This can be translated "They quickly sprouted and grew."
  * **they were scorched **- This can be translated "they were burned" or "they became too hot" (UDB). It can also be translated with an active verb: "the sun scorched them." (See: Active or Passive) The pronoun "they" in this verse refers to the young plants that sprouted from the seeds.
  * **they withered away **- “the plants became dry and shriveled up”
