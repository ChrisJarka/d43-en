\v 33 THis is what Yahweh says concerning the king of Assyria:  He will not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow here. 
           He will not attack it with warriers carrying shields or build seige works against it.
\v 34 He will return the way that he came, 
         and he will not enter this city, says Yahweh.
