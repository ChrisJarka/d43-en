<usfm>
\v 9 The women of my people you cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children you take away my glory for ever.
\v 10 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous
destruction.
\v 11 If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong
drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.
