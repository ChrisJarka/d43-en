\v 11 He replied to them, "Would anyone among you who has \add only\add* one sheep that falls into a hole on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f* \add just leave it there\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \add Certainly not!\add* You would take hold of it and lift it out right away, \add and that would be acceptable work on our day of rest, too\add*!
\v 12 \add Because\add* sheep are valuable, \add their owners may work on our day of rest in order to rescue them. So, because\add* people are more valuable than sheep, it is certainly right for us to do something good\add by healing another person any day, including\add* our day of rest!"

\v 11 And he said to them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the
sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?
\v 12 How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.
