===== Description =====

Connecting words are words that show how thoughts are related to other thoughts. This page is about words that connect statements and groups of statements to others. Examples of connecting words include: and, but, for, so, therefore, now, if, if only, since, then, when, while, whenever, because, yet, unless, like, and many more.
  * It was raining, __so__ I opened my umbrella.
  * It was raining, __but__ I did not have an umbrella.

Sometimes people do not use a connecting word when they expect the readers to understand the relationship because of the content.
  * It was raining. I didn't have an umbrella.

**Reason this is a translation issue**
  * Translators need to understand the meaning of a connecting word in the Bible and the relationship between the thoughts it is connecting.
  * Each language has its own ways of showing how thoughts are related.
  * Translators need to know how to help their readers understand the relationship between the thoughts.

**Translation Principles**
  * Translators need to translate in a way that readers can understand the same relationship between thoughts that the original readers would have understood.
  * Translators may use connecting words when the ULB does not.
  * Translators may choose not to use connecting words when the ULB does.
  * Translators may choose different connecting words to show the relationship.
===== Translation Strategies =====

If the way the relationship between thoughts is shown in the ULB would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, then consider using it. If not, here are some other options.\\

  - Use a connecting word (even if the ULB does not use one). 
  - Do not use a connecting word if it would be odd to use one and people would understand the right relationship between the thoughts without it.
  - Use a different connecting word. 


===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Use a connecting word (even if the ULB does not use one). 

  * **Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men." Immediately they left the nets and went after him.** (Mark 1:17-18) - They followed Jesus because he told them to. Some translators may want to mark this with "so."
    * "Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men." __So__ immediately they left the nets and went after him.** 

2. Do not use a connecting word if it would be odd to use one and people would understand the right relationship between the thoughts without it.

  * **Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil. Immediately they sprang up, __because__ the soil had no depth.** (Matthew 13:5) - If it would be obvious to people that the reason the seeds sprang up immediately was that the soil was shallow, then it may not be necessary to use the word "because." 
    * "Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil. The soil had no depth and they sprang up immediately. 


3. Use a different connecting word. 

  * **Therefore whoever breaks the least one of these commandments and teaches others to do so, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. __But__ whoever keeps them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.** (Matthew 5:19)  - The word "but" is used here because of the contrast between the two groups of people. But in some languages, the word "but" would show that what comes after it is surprising because of what came before it. So "and" might be clearer for those languages.
    * "Therefore whoever breaks the least one of these commandments and teaches others to do so, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. __And__ whoever keeps them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

  * **__Since__ the captain could not tell anything because of all the noise, he ordered that Paul be brought into the fortress.** (Acts 21:34) - Instead of starting the first part of the sentence with "since", some translators might prefer to start the second part of the sentence with "so". 
    * "The captain could not tell anything because of all the noise, __so__ he ordered that Paul be brought into the fortress.** 




//__**For**__\\
“all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of grass.\\
The grass withers, and the flower falls off,\\
but the word of the Lord remains forever.”\\
This is the message that was proclaimed as the gospel to you.\\
(I Peter 1:24-25 ULB)//\\

In the verses above, the connecting word “__For__” connects these verses to what has been said previously in this chapter, which is describing the eternal word of God. So, these  verses continue describing how God’s word is eternal, “remaining forever.”\\

However, the connecting word “__For__” may not need to be present in your language. It might be more clear in your language just to leave the word “__For__” out of the translation, especially if that word is likely to cause confusion in your readers.\\ 
\\



The connecting word “__but__” in these verses is connecting Peter’s description of the human body and flowers, which all die, with God’s word, which will never die. So, “__but__” is showing that there is a very strong difference between human bodies and flowers, and God’s word. “But” is strongly contrasting God’s word that lives forever with the lives of people and plants, which die.\\ 

So a connecting word in your language that indicates a strong contrast needs to be used here to show that the two thoughts connected by this connecting word are very different from one another—opposites from each other.\\
\\
**4.**  Translators may seek to translate with the same connecting word in your language when the meaning is essentially the same, even if the ULB does not use a connecting word, or even if the ULB uses different connecting words for the same meaning.\\

Readers of your translation may be helped if you choose connecting words in your language for meanings that the translation will keep standard. For example, if your language has words like the words below that you define and use with standard meanings, meanings that these words will usually have, then I Peter 2:24-25 might be translated as described below.\\
\\
**Therefore**: This connecting word means that because of what has just been 
described, a result of that will now be described.\\
**Because**:   This connecting word means that the cause or reason for something is about to be described.\\
**Then**:      This connecting word means that the event which follows comes after the event previously mentioned or described.\\
**But**:       This connecting word shows a contrast between what has been previously described and what follows.\\
If these connecting words are used according to the meanings above, then the verses from 1 Peter might translated as follows:\\


Two connecting words that appear often and can be misunderstood are "Now" and "Therefore".

**Now** - "Now” does not always mean “at this time.” Sometimes it is used to show a break in a storyline or teaching. What comes after "Now" 
  * may tell background information about someone or something in the story or teaching.\\
  * may start to tell a new part of the story or teaching.\\
  * may start to tell about a new person in the story or teaching.\\

  * **__Now__ the ark of Yahweh was in the country of the Philistines for seven months** (I Samuel 6:1)\\ 
  * **__Now__ I remind you, brothers and sisters, of the gospel I proclaimed to you, which you received and on which you stand…** (I Corinthians 15:1)

**Therefore** - This word shows that what came before it is a reason for what follows it. "What came before it" may be the immediately preceding sentence or something earlier. "Therefore" shows that what follows it is either a consequence or a conclusion of what came before it. It means “for that reason” or “so.” 

  * **If God so clothes the grass in the fields, which exists today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith __Therefore__ do not be anxious and say, 'What will we eat?' or, 'What will we drink?' or, 'What will we clothe ourselves in?'** (Matthew 6:31-32) \\ 
This is a conclusion. God cares even for the grass, so we should know that he will care for us.

  * **For the blood of the animals, sacrificed for sins, is brought by the high priest into the holy place, but their bodies are burned outside the camp. __Therefore__ Jesus also suffered outside the city gate, in order to sanctify the people through his own blood.**  (Hebrews 13:11, 12) \\ 
This is a consequence. Because the bodies of animal sacrifices had to be burned outside the camp, when Jesus offered himself as a sacrifice, it had to be done outside of the city.
