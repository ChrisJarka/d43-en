\v 25 "Because\add you should be concerned about what God thinks is important and not about material goods, I\add* tell you that you should not worry about \add things that you need in order to\add* live. \add Do not worry\add* about whether you will have \add enough food\add* to eat, and \add things\add* to drink, or \add enough\add* clothes to wear. It is important to have \add sufficient\add* food \add and drink\add* and clothing, but the way you conduct your lives is much more important \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\v 26 Look at the birds. They do not plant \add seeds, and they do not\add* harvest \add crops\add* and gather \add produce\add* into barns. \add They always have food to eat because God\add*, your Father who is in heaven, provides food for them. And you are certainly worth a lot more than birds \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! \add So you can be assured that God will supply what you need!\add*

\v 25 That is why I tell you that you should not worry about things that you need in order to live. Do not worry about whether you will have enough food to eat and things to drink, or enough clothes to wear. The way you conduct your lives is much more important than those things.
\v 26 Think about the birds. They do not plant seeds, and they do not harvest crops or gather produce into barns. They always have food to eat because God, your Father who is in heaven, provides food for them. And you are certainly worth a lot more than birds! So you can be assured that God will supply what you need!

\v 25 Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, what you will eat, what you will drink; nor yet for your body,
what you will put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
\v 26 Look at the birds in the air! They do not plant, and neither do they reap or gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father
feeds them. Are not you of much more value than they?
