====== Melchizedek ======

â€‹

===== Facts: =====

Melchizedek was the king of Salem (pre-Israelite Jerusalem about 2000 B.C.) and a priest called by "God Most High."

  * This  king and priest blessed Abram after Abram's victory over an alliance of powerful kings, and served him bread and wine.
  * Abram gave Melchizedek a tithe of one-tenth of the booty from this victory.
  * In Hebrews 7, Melchizedek is said to be greater than Abram because the tithe is paid from the lower to the higher, and so the blessing from Melchizedek the higher to Abram the lower.
  * Today, the amount of the tithe at one-tenth comes from this event.
  * Melchizedek is mentioned in Genesis 14, Psalm 110, and in Hebrews 5 - 7.
