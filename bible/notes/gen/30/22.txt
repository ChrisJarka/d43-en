\v 22 Then God thought about what Rachel wanted. He heard her prayers and enabled her to become pregnant.
\v 23 She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She said, "God has caused that no longer will I be ashamed for not having children."
\v 24 She named him Joseph, which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean 'I pray that he will give me another one.'
