Writing styles is also called 'Discourse.' It refers to how the parts of a text are organized and connected in order to communicate the author's meaning. In every translation, the way that words, sentences, and paragraphs are arranged will affect how people will understand the message.

==== Kinds of Writing Styles: ====

  * **Narrative**  or **[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_parables]]**- tells a story or event
  * **Explanatory**  - explains facts or teaches principles
  * **Procedural**  - tells how to do something
  * **Argumentative**  - tries to persuade someone to do something
  * **[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]]**- expresses ideas and feelings in a beautiful way
  * **[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_proverbs]]**- briefly teaches a truth or wisdom

The purpose of a particular text will influence what kinds of discourse features are used. For example, in a narrative, discourse features would include:
  * telling about events that happen before and after other events;
  * introducing people in the story;
  * introducing new events in the story;
  * conversation and the use of quotes;
  * referring to people and things with nouns or pronouns.

Languages have organized ways of communicating information in each of these discourse types.

==== Writing Style Issues: ====

  - **[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_newevent]]**- Phrases like “One day” or “It came about that” or “This is how it happened” or “Sometime after that” signal to the reader that a new event is about to be told.
  - **[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_participants]]**- Languages have ways of introducing new people and of referring to those people again.
  - **[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]]**- An author may use background information for several reasons: 1) to add interest to the story, 2) to provide important historical or cultural information or 3) to tell the reader, or listener, something very important.
  - **Pronoun reference system**  - Languages have patterns for how frequently to use pronouns. If that pattern is not followed, wrong meaning can result.
  - **[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_quotations]]**- Languages have different ways of reporting what someone said.
  - **[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_connectingwords]]**- Languages have patterns for how to use connecting words (such as “and,” “but,” or “then”).
  - **Relative prominence or emphasis**  - Languages have different ways of showing which parts of a sentence, paragraph, or story are being emphasized the most.
