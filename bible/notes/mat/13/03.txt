\v 3 He was telling them many parables. \add One of the parables\add* that he told them was this: "Listen! A man went out \add to his field\add* to sow \add some seeds\add*.
\v 4 As he was scattering \add them over the soil\add*, some \add of the\add* seeds fell on the path. Then some birds came and ate those seeds.
\v 5 Other \add seeds\add* fell on ground where there was not much soil \add on top of the\add* rock. Those seeds sprouted very soon, \add because the sun quickly warmed\add* the shallow soil.
\v 6 But when \add the young plants came up\add*, they were scorched by the sun, and they withered because they did not have \add deep\add* roots.

\v 3 And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;
\v 4 and as he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:
\v 5 and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no
deepness of earth:
\v 6 and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
