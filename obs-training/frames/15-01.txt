===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **At last it was time for** - "At last" means "finally" or, "after a long wait." To make it clear what “time” refers to, you could say, "after they had wandered in the desert for 40 years, God finally permitted.”  
  * **two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho** - This could be translated as, "two men to Jericho, a city in Canaan, to find out information about it.” Also see the notes for, “spy out the land” in **[[:en:obs-training:frames:14-04|[14-04]]]**. 
  * **protected by strong walls** - This could be translated as, “completely surrounded by thick, strong walls made of stone to protect it from their enemies.” 
  * **escape** – It is also possible to add, "escape from people in Jericho who wanted to harm them.”
  * **her family** - Rahab asked for protection for her father, mother, brothers, and sisters. Use your word for family that includes these people.
