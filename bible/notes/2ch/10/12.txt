\v 12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
\v 13 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
\v 14 and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my
father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
