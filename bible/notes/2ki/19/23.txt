\v 23 By your messengers you have defied the Lord, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height
of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into his farthest lodging-place, the forest of his fruitful field.
\v 24 I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.
