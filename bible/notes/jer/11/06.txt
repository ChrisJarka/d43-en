====== Jeremiah 11:6-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Then Yahweh said to me, "Go into the streets of Jerusalem and to the other cities in Judah. Proclaim my message to the people. Tell them to listen to the agreement \add that I made with their ancestors\add* and to obey it.
\v 7 When I brought their ancestors out of Egypt, I solemnly pleaded with them many times to obey me, and I am still pleading with them now.
\v 8 But they did not obey me or even pay any attention to me. Everyone continued to be stubborn and to do the evil things that they wanted to do. I commanded them to do what was written in the agreement, but they refused. So I punished them in all the ways that I promised that I would."

\v 6 Yahweh said to me, ‘Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem and say, “Listen to the words of this covenant and do them!”
\v 7 For I solemnly charged your fathers in the day I brought them up from the land of Egypt even until this day to be persistent to fulfil their assignment, and said, “Listen to my voice!”
\v 8 But they did not listen and would not stretch out their ear! But each man walked in the stubbornness of his wicked heart. So I brought all the words of this covenant 
that I commanded to do against them, but they would not do them!”’
