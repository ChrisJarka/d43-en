====== 2 Corinthians 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Paul continues his defense. Paul views the Corinthian Christians as the proof of his work. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Law of Moses ==
There are many allusions to God giving the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law to Moses]]. This chapter will be difficult to fully understand if the Old Testament has not yet been translated. This chapter contrasts the [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenat]] God made with Moses with the [[:en:obe:kt:newcovenant| New Covenant]]. Although the Law was good, because it was [[:en:obe:kt:reveal|revealed]] by God, it brought punishment to Israel because they were unable to obey it. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Metaphors ==
There are many [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphors]] used in this chapter to explain complex spiritual truths. It is unclear whether this makes Paul's teaching easier or more difficult to understand. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "This is a covenant not of the letter but of the Spirit." ==
It is uncertain what this means but the New Covenant is contrasted with the Law of Moses. The New Covenant is not comprised of a system of rules and regulations. It is possible that the term [[:en:obe:kt:spirit|spirit]] is a reference to the Holy Spirit, but it may also be a reference to the New Covenant being "spiritual" in nature.
