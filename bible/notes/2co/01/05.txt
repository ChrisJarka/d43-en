<usfm>
\v 5 It is true that just like Christ suffered, we \add who serve him\add* also continually suffer \add because we belong to him\add*. But also, because we \add belong to\add* Christ, God greatly strengthens us just as\f + \ft Or: just like \f* \add God strengthened him\add*.
\v 6 So, whenever we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* experience sufferings, we \add learn how to encourage\add* you \add when you experience sufferings. As a result, you will become more and more the kind of people God\add* wants you to be. Whenever \add God\add* strengthens us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* in our sufferings, he\add* does that in order that you \add may see how he makes us strong when we are suffering. Then, as God\add* encourages \add you in that way\add*, you will learn to continue patiently \add trusting him\add* when you suffer as we do.
\v 7 As a result, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* strongly expect that because you suffer just as\f + \ft Or: just \f* like we do, \add God\add* will encourage you just as\f + \ft Or: just like \f* \add he\add* encourages us.

\v 5 Our sufferings caused us great pain, the kind of pain that Christ went through. But we also experience comfort from Christ which is too great for us to measure.
\v 6 So, whenever we experience sufferings, it is so God may comfort you and rescue you from danger. Whenever God comforts us, it is so you can be comforted even more, so he can teach you to you wait for God, when you suffer in the same way we suffered.
\v 7 We are certain about what will happen to you, because you suffer like we suffer, you also will experience God's comfort, as we do.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 For just as we experience the sufferings of Christ which are beyond all measure,  we also experience through Christ comfort that cannot be measured.
\v 6 But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. Or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which works when you patiently share in the same sufferings that we also suffer.
\v 7 And our hope for you is certain, knowing that as you also share the sufferings, you also share the comfort.
