\v 31 "God has said in the Scriptures, 'If a man is divorcing his wife, he should write a document on which he states that he is divorcing her.'
\v 32 But now listen to what I say to you: a man may divorce his wife only if she has committed adultery. If a man divorces his wife for any other reason, she commits adultery if she marries someone else. And the man who marries her also commits adultery."

\v 31 It was also said, 'Whoever sends his wife away, let him give her a certificate of divorcement.'
\v 32 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her after she has been divorced commits adultery.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples.

  * **It was also said** - God is the one who "said." Jesus uses the passive here to make it plain that it is not God or God's word that he disagrees with. Rather, he is saying that a divorce is just only if it occurs for the right reason. A divorce can be unjust even if the man obeys the command to give a written notice. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]].)
  * **sends his wife away** - This is a euphemism for divorce. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **let him give** - "he must give"
  * **But I say** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:21|5:22]].
  * **makes her an adulteress** - It is the man who divorces the woman improperly who "causes her to commit adultery." In many cultures it would be normal for her to remarry, but if the divorce is improper, such a remarriage is adultery.
