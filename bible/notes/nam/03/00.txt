====== Nahum 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:1-13, which is a poetic prophecy. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])

Despite being divided into three chapters, they all consist of one long prophecy. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Euphemism ==
This chapter speaks about the evils of the Assyrians in somewhat graphic ways. It is important to avoiding toning dow this language through the use of euphemism, if at all possible. Although there is some hyperbole, the reader should not assume that the author intends this writing to be taken as completely hyperbolic. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
