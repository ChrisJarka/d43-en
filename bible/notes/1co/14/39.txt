\v 39 So the final word on this is:  With great zeal, seek to give inspiring explanations of God's word to the church; speak with the power and application of the prophets of old. But also, do not forbid anyone from speaking in tongues, which may be something a person does alone between him and God, or in the service with an interpretation.
\v 40 All that is done in the worship of the church, should be done with decorum and in proper order.
