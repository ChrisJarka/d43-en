\v 5 Then his \add soldiers\add* will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will remain there until I arrange for him to be punished. And if he tries to fight against the soldiers from Babylonia, he will not succeed." King Zedekiah asked me why I continued to say that.

\v 3 King Zedekiah had put me there. I continued to prophesy there about what would happen. I continued to say, "Yahweh says that he is about to allow the army of the king of Babylon to capture this city .
\v 5 Then his soldiers will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will remain there until I arrange for him to be punished. And if he tries to fight against the soldiers from Babylonia, he will not succeed." King Zedekiah asked me why I continued to say that, but Yahweh had said this would be so.

\v 3 Zedekiah the king of Judah had imprisoned him and said, “Why do you prophecy and say, ‘Thus says Yahweh: Look! I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, 
and he will take it!
\v4 But Zedekiah the king of Judah will not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, for he has indeed been given to the hand of the king of Babylon, and his mouth will declare 
to the king’s mouth and his eyes will see the king’s eyes.
\v 5 For Zekediah will go to Babylon and he will be there until I visit him—this is Yahweh’s declaration—since you fought the Chaldeans. You will not be successful!’”
