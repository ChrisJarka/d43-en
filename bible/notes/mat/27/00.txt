======  Matthew 27 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "Delivered him to Pilate the governor" ==
The Jews were under the rule of the Roman Empire, and the Romans did not allow the them to execute any criminal without first obtaining permission. So the Jewish leaders had to ask Pontius Pilate to confirm their sentence on Jesus. Pilate tried to avoid confirming their decision. He tried to make the Jewish leaders choose between freeing Jesus or a very bad prisoner named Barabbas. 

== Tomb ==
The tomb in which Jesus was buried (see [[en:bible:notes:mat:27:59|27:59-60]]) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy people were buried.


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== "Hail, King of the Jews!" ==
This is sarcasm, which is the use of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]] to insult someone. This chapter uses the phrase "this is Jesus the king of the Jews" in the same way.
