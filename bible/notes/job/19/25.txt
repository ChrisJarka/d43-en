\q
\v 25 But as for me I know that my Redeemer liveth,
\q And at last he will stand up upon the earth:
\q
\v 26 And after my skin, even this body, is destroyed,
\q Then without my flesh shall I see God;
\q
\v 27 Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side,
\q And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger.
\q My heart is consumed within me.
