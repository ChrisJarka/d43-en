\v 1 I will stand at my guard post and station myself on the watchtower, and I will watch carefully
\q to see what he will say to me and how I should turn from my complaint.
\f + \ft Instead of \fqa how I should turn from my complaint \fqa* , which is what the Hebrew text has, some modern versions have \fqa how I should answer when he replies to my complaint \fqa* or \fqa how I should answer when he rebukes me \fqa* . \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I will stand at my guard post and station myself on the watchtower** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Possible meanings are 1) Habakkuk went to an actual post in the watchtower or 2) this is a metaphor in which Habakkuk speaks of waiting eagerly for Yahweh's response as if he were a watchman waiting at his post for the arrival of a messenger. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to see what he will say to me** - "to see what Yahweh will say to me"
  * **how I should turn from my complaint** - Here the word "turn" refers to returning an answer. Habakkuk considers what answer he will give concerning the things that he has said. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
