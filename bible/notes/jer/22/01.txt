\v 1 Thus said Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,
\v 2 and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, that sit upon the throne of David, thou, and your servants, and your people that enter in by these gates.
\v 3 Thus says Jehovah: Execute you justice and righteousness, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence, to the sojourner, the fatherless, nor the widow; neither shed innocent blood in this place.
