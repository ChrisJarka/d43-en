=== Reasons this is a translation issue ===

  * Translators need to understand the what each possessive relationship means.  is between two nouns when one possesses the other.
  * Some languages may not use possession to show some of the relationships that are shown by possession in the source Bible that you use.

When two nouns are connected by the word “of” in the Bible, as in “the love of God,” the meaning can be unclear. Does “the love of God” refer to God loving people, or to people loving God, or to something else? This page seeks to provide help with how to translate phrases where two nouns are joined by “of” in the Bible.

=== Translation Principles ===

The list below explains some relationships between nouns that could apply in a passage you are translating. Use this information to help you determine how best to translate related nouns, which occur very often in the Bible.

Seek to understand the relationship of the nouns in the original context, and work to make sure your translation makes that relationship clear. The context should clarify which possible meaning from below is actually meant.

One noun (or pronoun) can be related to another noun (or pronoun) in several different ways, as described below. These verse quotations are from the ULB, and then they are retranslated to describe the meaning.

1. **Description**: when the noun after “of” describes the other noun
>a baptism __of repentance__ (Mark 1:4 ULB)\\
This means "a repentance __kind of__ baptism."

2. **Ownership**: when the noun after “of” owns the other noun
>the prisoner __of Christ Jesus__ (Ephesians 3:1 ULB)\\
This means "the prisoner who __belongs to__ Christ Jesus."

3. **Identity**: when the noun after “of” has the same identity as the other noun
>the gift __of the Holy Spirit__ (Acts 10:45 ULB)\\
This means “the gift __which is__ the Holy Spirit.” 

4. **Subject**: when the noun after “of” produces or causes the other noun
>the love __of Christ__ (2 Corinthians 5:14 ULB)\\
This could mean either “the love __that Christ produces__,” where Christ is the subject who produces the love.
>the expectation of the people __of the Jews__ (Acts 12:11 ULB)
This could mean  “the expectation __that the Jews caused__.”

5. **Object**: when the noun after “of” is the object of the action done by the other noun
>the love __of Christ__ (2 Corinthians 5:14 ULB)\\
This could mean, “the love __for__ Christ,” Christ would be the object who receives love from those who love him.
>blasphemy __against the Spirit__ (Matthew 12:31 UDB)
This could mean that the Spirit is the __object__ of blasphemy.

6. **Whole**: when the noun or pronoun after “of” is a group in which the other noun or pronoun is a part.
>To __each one of us__ has been given a gift (Ephesians 4:7 ULB)\\
"Each one” refers to the parts of the whole group, and the whole group is “us.”


===== Examples from the Bible =====

**1.**  Which sort of possession described above would you say “kingdom of heaven” is in the verse below? Which translation below makes the most sense in this context?

“But Jesus said, ‘Permit the little children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for the **kingdom of heaven** belongs to such ones.’” (Matthew 19:14 ULB)\\    
In this context, what meaning of “kingdom of heaven” seems to be the intended meaning?
  - **Description**: the heaven __kind of__ kingdom?		     
  - **Ownership**:   the kingdom that __belongs to__ heaven?          
  - **Identity**:    the kingdom which __is__ heaven?
  - **Subject**:     the kingdom __produced by__ heaven?	             
  - **Object**:      the kingdom which __produces__ heaven?	     
  - **Whole**:       the kingdom which is __a part of__ heaven?       
Which category above would you say best fits the meaning of the Biblical phrase, “kingdom of heaven”?  Can you explain why you chose the meaning above that you chose?

**2.**  In Ephesians 6:17 there are three examples of two related nouns. Which category of meaning above would you say best fits each of these? Each phrase may be different from the others (or, the same). 
“And take the **helmet of salvation**, and the **sword of the Spirit**, which is the **word of God**” (Ephesians 6:17 ULB)   

===== Examples from English =====
English shows ownership in two ways: an **of**-phrase (with the possessor noun second) or with the possessive **'s** (with the possessor noun first). Depending on the version of the Bible, nouns of possession may be translated with either the possessive **'s** (such as God's word) or with **of** (such as word of God). Examples:\\
  * The man's office
  * The dog's tail
  * The color of the car
  * The people of the town

===== Translation Strategies =====

  - Thoroughly understand the context. Begin by understanding the verse or passage in light of the verses around it. 
  - Determine the categories above that best fit the context. Rule out the categories that do not make sense, and then study the categories that could be possible.
  - From the best possible categories for this context, choose the one that makes the best sense in this particular context.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

The following applications of the Translation Strategies concern this verse:\\
“And take the **helmet of salvation**, and the **sword of the Spirit**, which is the **word of God**.” (Ephesians 6:17 ULB)   

1. Thoroughly understand the context. Begin by understanding the verse or passage in light of the verses around it.

He explains the weapons of this spiritual war against evil, commanding them in verse 11, “Put on the whole armor of God.” In verse 17 he lists three weapons in that armor.

2. Determine the categories above that best fit the context. Rule out the categories that do not make sense, and then study the categories that could be possible.

What do these descriptions of spiritual weapons mean in the context of spiritual warfare? Think about, or write out, how each phrase would be translated in each of the categories above. Which translations make sense and fit best in this context of spiritual warfare?     

3. From the best possible categories for this context, choose the one that makes the best sense in this particular context.\\
