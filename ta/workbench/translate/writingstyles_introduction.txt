===== Writing Styles - Introduction of New and Old Participants =====

===== Description =====

The first time that people or things are mentioned in a story, they are new participants. After that whenever they are mentioned they are old participants.\\
Examples John 3:1 Now there was a Pharisee __whose name was Nicodemus__,\\

=== Reason this could be a translation issue  ===
In order to make your translation clear and natural, it is necessary to properly mark new participants new; old participants old.


===== Examples from the Bible =====


===== Translation Strategies =====
  - In most languages new participants are introduced with a clause telling something about them.
  - After that in many languages the participant is referred to with a pronoun where it is clear who is being referred to.
  - In languages where the subject is marked in the verb, many languages do not mark old participants.  

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====\\

 1. In most languages new participants are introduced with a clause telling something about them.
  * **Esther 2:6 //There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai.**\\
 2. After that in many languages the participant is referred to with a pronoun where it is clear who is being referred to.
  * **__He__ had been taken away from Jerusalem with the exiles** Since Mordecai had already been mentioned, he is referred to here with the pronoun "he".\\ 
 3. In languages where the subject is marked in the verb, many languages do not mark old participants.\\
  * This can not be illustrated with English because English does not mark the subject in the verb.
