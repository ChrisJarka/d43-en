===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **and I did not wish to write them with paper and ink** - "Paper" is a material made from a papyrus plant on which a person writes. "Ink" is a colored liquid used to write words on the paper. Alternate translation: "but I did not want to write them to you in a letter."  
  * **joy may be made full** - "joy may be complete"
  * **The children of your elect sister** - Here John compares the church this other church to a "sister." And, the believers that are a part of that church are compared to children. This emphasizes that all believers are a spiritual family. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
