\v 19 So, my fellow believers, because we \add trust in what Jesus accomplished when\add* his own blood \add flowed for us\add*, we can confidently go into \add God's very presence\add* that was \add symbolized\add* by the very holy place \add in the tent\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 20 He enabled us to go into \add God's presence\add* by making a new and effective way. \add Specifically\add*, he \add offered\add* his body \add as a sacrifice\add* for us \add in order that nothing would stop us\add* from entering \add God's presence, just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the curtain \add of the very holy place prevented people from entering God's presence\add*.
\v 21 Christ is a great priest \add who rules over us, who are\add* God's people \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 22 \add Just like the priests\add* were sprinkled \f + \ft Or:\add as Moses\add* sprinkled \add the priests\add* \f* \add with blood\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* to symbolize that they were no longer guilty for having sinned, we also no longer are \add guilty for having done\add* evil. \add Just like the priests ceremonially\add* washed their bodies with pure water \add to prepare themselves to serve God\add*, we are allowing \add God\add* to continually make us pure. So, we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* must approach \add God\add* sincerely by confidently trusting \add in him\add*.

\v 19 So, my fellow believers, because we trust in what Jesus accomplished when his own blood flowed for us, we can confidently go into God's very presence that was symbolized by the very holy place in the sacred tent.
\v 20 He has enabled us to go into God's presence by making a new way in which we can live forever. This new way is Jesus, who died for us.
\v 21 Christ is a great priest who rules over us, we who are God's people.
\v 22 So we must approach God sincerely by confidently trusting in Jesus. It is he who has made our hearts pure from having sinned. It is as if he sprinkled his own blood over our hearts, and as if he had washed our bodies in pure water.

\v 19 Therefore, brothers, we have confidence to enter into the most holy place by the blood of Jesus.
\v 20 That is the way that he has opened for us by means of his body, a new and living way through the curtain.
\v 21 And because we have a great priest over the house of God,
\v 22 let us draw near with a true heart in the full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and having our body washed with pure water.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Having made it clear that there is only one sacrifice for sin, the writer continues with the picture of the holiest place in the temple where only the high priest could enter each year with the blood of the sacrifice for sins. He reminds the believers that they now worship in that holy place.

  * **brothers** - Here this includes all believers in Christ since all are members of one spiritual family  with God as their heavenly Father.
  * **the most holy place** - the presence of God (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **his body** - "his death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **through the curtain** - The curtain in the earthly temple represents the separation between people and God's true presence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the house of God** - all believers (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **full assurance** - a strong feeling of confidence

  * **having our hearts sprinkled clean** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "as if he made our hearts clean with his blood." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
