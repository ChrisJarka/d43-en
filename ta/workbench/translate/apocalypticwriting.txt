==== Description ====

God showed his prophets things he would do in the future. Some of these things have already happened, and some will happen in our future. 

God showed many of these things using symbolic language.This may include violent or power events that may be hard to believe or seem impossible

Reason this is a translation issue:

=== Translation Principles === 
  * Translate the images in the text. Do not try to interpret them and translate their meaning.
    * Some images may be about miraculous events,
    * Other images may be symbols of other things.
