===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They will slice meat off the right hand and still be hungry; they will eat off the left hand but will not be satisfied.** - Isaiah continues to describe how wicked deeds destroys everything (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:09:18|9:18-19]]). Here he describes it as people eating one another. This emphasizes that when people are wicked even family and friends start to destroy one another. Alternate translation: "They will destroy each other like a person eating another person, but this will not satisfy them." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Each will even eat the flesh of his own arm** - Alternate translation: "The wicked person will even start to harm himself like a person eating his own flesh."
  * **Manasseh will devour Ephraim, and Ephraim, Manasseh** - This refers to the people of Manasseh and the people of Ephraim. Alternate translation: "The people of Manasseh and the people of Ephraim will attack each other" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **and they together will attack Judah** - Alternate translation: "and they together will attack the people of Judah" 
  * **Yahweh's anger will not subside, but his hand will still be stretched out to strike** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:09:16|09:17]].
