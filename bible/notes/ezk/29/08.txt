\v 8 Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and will cut off from you man and beast.
\v 9 And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. Because he has said, The
river is mine, and I have made it;
\v 10 therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and
desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia.
