===== Facts: =====

Beersheba was an Old Testament city located about 45 miles southwest of Jerusalem.

  * When Abraham sent them out of his camp, Beersheba was the wilderness area where Hagar and her son Isaac, Abraham's son, wandered until God saved them.
  * Abraham dug a water well in this area that was seized by Abimelech's men.
  * Because Abraham protested the seizure, it was returned to him, and he named the place Beersheba.
