As you translate, be sure that you:

  * translate everything that is in the source language
  * don't add anything that that is not necessary for comprehension
  * always do your translation according to the [[en:ta:vol1:intro:translation_guidelines]]
  * always do your translation according to the [[:en:ta:vol1:intro:statement_of_faith]]
  * use the translation notes and the explanations of important words to help you make a better translation.
