\v 23 So now \add I will tell you why I changed my mind and did not visit you as I intended to do\add*: God himself knows \add that what I am telling you is true\add*. The reason that I did not return to Corinth was so that I might not have to \add speak to you severely about the wrong that you had done\add*.
\v 24 It is not that Silas, Timothy and I want to boss you \add and tell you that you must\add* believe only what we say. \add Not at all!\add* On the contrary, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are working as partners \add with you\add* in order to make you happy. \add We do not try to force you to believe everything that we believe, because we are sure that you are continuing to\add* trust \add the Lord Jesus Christ\add* and that you are remaining firmly committed to him.

\v 23 God will confirm my purpose for coming to you, Corinthiansâ€”it was not to keep from facing the conflicts you have in the church.
\v 24 We are not like masters who give your orders about how you must serve God, but we will work with you, so you can find your joy and then you can stand strong in your faith.

\v 23 But I call God to bear witness against me--that I did not come to Corinth to spare you.
\v 24 Not because we are commanding what your faith should be, but we are working with you for your joy, as you stand in your faith.
