\p
\v 1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the kingâ€™s heart was toward Absalom.
\v 2 And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said to her, I pray thee, feign yourself to be a mourner,
and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not yourself with oil, but be as a woman that has a long time mourned for
the dead:
\v 3 and go in to the king, and speak on this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
