====== Galatians 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

The introduction to this letter slightly different than Paul other letters because it states, "I am not an apostle from men nor through a man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead." This is likely because there were false teachers who opposed Paul and undermined his authority.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Heresy ==
There is only one biblical [[:en:obe:kt:gospel|gospel]] that is capable of saving a person eternally. This is the true gospel, any other version of the gospel is under condemnation from God. Those who teach a false gospel are considered [[:en:obe:kt:curse|accursed]] and it is possible that they are outside of salvation. They should be treated as non-Christians.

== Paul's qualifications ==

There was a common issue in the early church where certain people taught that Gentiles needed to obey the Law of Moses. In this chapter, Paul gives his credentials or qualifications as a "exemplary" Jew in order to refute this teaching (1:11-24). As a Jew and the apostle to the Gentile people, Paul is uniquely qualified to address this issue.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "You are turning so quickly to a different gospel" ==
Galatians was probably the first letter Paul wrote, making this line one of the first recorded statements about the early church. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
