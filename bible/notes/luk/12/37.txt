\v 37 Blessed are those servants, whom the master will find watching when he comes. Truly I say to you that he will (prepare to serve by) putting a belt around himself, and will make them sit down to a meal, and will come and serve them.
\v 38 If the master comes in the second watch of the night, or if even in the third watch, and finds them ready, blessed are those servants.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to tell his disciples a parable.)
  * **Blessed are those servants**  - "How good it is for those servants"
  * **whom the master will find watching when he comes**  - "that, when the master returns, he finds them watching for him" or "whose master finds them waiting for him when he returns" or "who are ready when the master returns."
  * **He will put a belt around himself** - This can be translated with the implicit information made explicit: “He will put a belt around himself in order to serve” or “He will prepare to serve by tying his clothes with a belt around his waist” or “He will dress to serve.” (See: [[en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit]])
  * **in the second watch of the night**  - This can be translated as "late at night" or "just before midnight." In those times people divided the night into four periods when guards would watch the city to make sure no enemies broke into it. The second watch was when the second group of guards would be watching the city. That was between 9:00 and midnight.
  * **or if even in the third watch**  - This can be translated as "or if he comes very late at night" or "just before when the rooster first crows." The third watch was from midnight to 3:00 in the morning.
