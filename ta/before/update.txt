===== How to Update a Previous Version of Open Bible Stories =====

In an effort to ensure the highest quality resource possible with the highest level of accuracy to the Bible, several revisions have been made to Open Bible Stories through the years. Sometimes translations have been made off of a previous version. It is our desire that every translation be updated to the latest, best version of Open Bible Stories. 

==== Definition of a Version of Open Bible Stories ====

A version of Open Bible Stories refers to a variation in the text itself that differs from an earlier form of the same text. 

Versions are indicated by two or three numbers separated by periods (e.g. 2.0 or 3.1.2). 

The purpose of using versions is to easily and consistently be able to differentiate between and communicate about variations and modifications Open Bible Stories has gone through.

==== How Version Numbering Happens ====

Open Bible Stories was written in English and remains the "gold standard" of Open Bible Stories. After Open Bible Stories was originally written, let's say it was version 1.0. Each major change after that bumped the translation up 0.1. So after the first major change after it was written, Open Bible Stories went from version 1.0 to version 1.1. For each minor change, a version is increased by 0.0.1. So let's say after the major change a minor change was then made, the version would increase from 1.1 to 1.1.1. Either after an especially large change or after a series of major changes, the version number is bumped up to the next level and "resets". For instance, after version 1.1.1 if there was an especially large change, the next release would be 2.0. 

In general, major changes constitute changes that have theological implications, restructuring of image and story order, or the changing of images. Minor changes include fixing typos and simple rewording that will not largely affect translations (e.g. changing "unleavened bread" to "bread that is made without yeast").

Version Numbering for translations takes the version number of the source language and adds 0.1. So if somebody translates from English version 2.1.1, the translation would be version 2.2.1. 

==== Identify which Version of Open Bible Stories ====

Many translations have the version number listed. You can find the version number in the side bar for whatever language you happen to be on in Door43.

Some translations, especially those done offline, do not have the version number. To figure out which version a particular translation is:
  * Check story #45. If it ends with Philip looking at the chariot then it is translated from version 1.0. If it ends with the Ethiopian Official smiling go to the next step.
  * Check 06-02. If the phrase "to the land where Abraham's relatives lived" is not included then it is translated from version 2.0. If it is included it is translated from at least version 3.0. (Also check 09-06, if "in order to save him from being killed" is not included it is translated from version 2.0. If it is included it is translated from at least version 3.0.) 
  * If you are still not sure, we have created a complete set of all the changes between  [[https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_1-to-ver_3.html|Version 1]] or [[https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_2-to-ver_3.html|Version 2]] and the current. Compare your translation to determine which version your translation was made off of. Note: All text highlighted in green has been added, highlighted in yellow has been changed, and highlighted in red has been deleted. Only frames that have changed are included.
  * To make sure you have all the latest changes, look at the [[en:obs:change-log|change log]] and make sure these changes have been made in your language.
