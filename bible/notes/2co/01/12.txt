====== 2 Corinthians 01:12-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 I am happy \add to say\add* that I have behaved toward all people \f + \ft metonymy \f* in an honest and sincere way. I am sure within myself \add that this is true\add*. Especially, I have behaved toward you \add honestly and sincerely because that is what\add* God wants us to do. As I have done that, \add my thoughts\add* have not been the thoughts that unbelieving people \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add think are\add* wise. Instead, \add I have behaved toward people only as God wants me to, depending on\add* God to help me in ways that I do not deserve.
\v 13 \add I say that\add* because \add in all my letters to you\add* I have always written \f + \ft litotes \f* clearly in a way that you can easily and completely understand \add when you\add* read them.
\v 14 \add Previously some of\add* you, but not all of you, have completely understood \add that I am always honest and sincere with you\add*. But I confidently expect that \add soon\add* you will all be fully convinced \add about that\add*. Then when the Lord Jesus \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add returns, you will all be able to say that\add* you are pleased with me, just like I will \add be able to say that\add* I am pleased with you.

\v 12  We can give this praise about ourselves, that we have we lived toward all people in an honest and sincere way. We lived in the world as God's own people and we have deep trust in God, that was a gift from him. We do not live by the world's values. We do not listen to the world's wisdom when we choose what we will do, but because God's loving gifts fill our lives, you can see God is working in us.
\v 13 You read my letters. I have written them so you can understand them.
\v 14 You know a little about us now, but on the day when the Lord Jesus returns, you will praise us before him, and we will praise you before him.

\p
\v 12 Now this is our boast:  the testimony of our conscience is that  we conducted ourselves in the world with holiness and sincerity that are from God, not according to earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and even more toward you.
\v 13 We do not write to you anything you cannot read or understand--and I hope that
\v 14 as you already understand us in part, that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast about us as we will boast of you.
