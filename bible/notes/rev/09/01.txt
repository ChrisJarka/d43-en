\v 1 Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. God gave it the key to the shaft that went down but had no ending.
\v 2 When he opened that shaft, smoke rose from it like smoke from a great burning furnace. The smoke prevented anyone from seeing the light of the sun and the sky.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet. I saw a star from heaven that had fallen to the earth. The star was given the key of the shaft leading to shaft of the bottomless pit.
\v 2 He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and a column of smoke went up out of the shaft like smoke from a huge furnace. The sun and the air turned dark by the smoke pouring out of the shaft.

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The fifth of the seven angels begins to sound his trumpet.

  * **the shaft of the bottomless pit** - "Shaft" and "pit" refer to the same thing. It is a narrow hole that is so deep that it has no bottom; it continues to go down.
  * **like smoke from a huge furnace** - A huge furnace gives off a great amount  of thick, dark smoke. AT: "like the great amount of smoke that comes from a huge furnace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
