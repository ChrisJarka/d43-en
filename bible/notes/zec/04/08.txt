\v 8 Then Yahweh gave me \add another\add* message.
\v 9 He said to me, "Zerubbabel \f + \ft synecdoche \f* laid the first stone in the foundation of the temple, and he will put the last stone in its place. When that happens, the people will know that it is I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, who have sent you to them.

\v 10 No one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* should think that little things that are done at the beginning of a big project are unimportant. \add When the temple is almost finished being rebuilt\add*, Zerubbabel will use a plumb line\f + \ft Or: string with a stone fastened to it \f* \add to see if the walls they are building are straight\add*, so when the people see that, they will rejoice."

\v 8 So the word of Yahweh came to me and said, 
\v 9 "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house and his hands shall also finish it; and so you will know that
Yahweh of hosts has sent me to you.
\v 10 Who has despised the day of small things? These people shall rejoice and shall see the plumb stone in the hand of
Zerubbabel. These are the eyes of Yahweh that roam over the whole earth.
