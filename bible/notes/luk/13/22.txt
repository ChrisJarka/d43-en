===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus goes to various towns and villages and teaches people.)
    * **and taught them** - Jesus taught the people living in the towns and villages through which he passed. This could also be translated as "and taught the people in those places."
    * **Are only a few people to be saved?** - That is, "Will only  a few people be saved?"
    * **Struggle to enter the narrow day** - That is, "Make every effort to go through the narrow door."  This is a metaphor meaning to become one whom God will save. It could also be translated as "Work hard to go through the narrow door to salvation" or "Do your best to go through the narrow way so that God will save you."
