The **[[:en:obe:kt:angel|angel]]** responded to Zechariah, “I was sent by **[[:en:obe:kt:god|God]]** to bring you this good news. Because you did not **[[:en:obe:kt:believe|believe]]** me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born.” Immediately, **[[:en:obe:other:zechariahnt|Zechariah]]** was unable to speak. Then the angel left Zechariah. After this, Zechariah returned home and his wife **became pregnant**.
