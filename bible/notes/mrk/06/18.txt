\v 18 For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brotherâ€™s wife.
\v 19 And Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not;
\v 20 for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was
much perplexed; and he heard him gladly.
