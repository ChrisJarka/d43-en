\v 3 What rulers \add do\add* is not \add to cause people who\add* do good deeds to be afraid. Instead, \add what they do is to cause people who do\add* evil to be afraid. So, if any of you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* wants to be unafraid of officials, do what is good! \add If you\f + \ft singular \f* do good\add*, they will commend you \add instead of punishing you!\add*
\v 4 It is in order to serve God \add by doing their work that every official exists\add*, in order that they may benefit each of you. If any of you does what is evil, you\add \f + \ft singular \f* will rightfully have reason to\add* be afraid, because the authority that they have to punish people \f + \ft metonymy \f* is very real \f + \ft litotes \f*! The officials exist to serve God. That is, they act as God's agents as they punish those who do evil.
\v 5 So, it is necessary for you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* to be subject \add to officials\add*, not only because they will punish you \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add if you disobey them\add*, but also because you know within yourselves\add that you should be subject to them\add*!

\v 3 For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. And would you have no fear of the power? do that which is good, and you shall have praise from the same:
\v 4 for he is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is a minister of God, an avenger for wrath to him that does evil.
\v 5 Wherefore you must needs be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscienceâ€™ sake.
