====== Introduction to Ezra ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of Ezra ===

  - The first Jewish exiles return to Jerusalem from Persia (1:1–2:70)
  - The rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem and reestablishment of temple worship (3:1–6:22)
  - More exiles return, and reformation and implementation of the Law of Yahweh under Ezra’s leadership (7:1–10:44)
    - Ezra teaches the people the Law of Yahweh and sets apart the priests and Levites for their service (8:1–36)
    - The problem of inter-marriage, and the solution (9:1–10:44)

=== What is the Book of Ezra about? ===

Ezra begins with an account of those who first returned to Jerusalem after the exile. The book of Ezra continues the narrative of the Chronicles. It is about the people of Israel returning from Babylon and their efforts to restore the proper worship of Yahweh. This included the rebuilding of the [[:en:obe:kt:temple|temple]] for sacrifices, the affirmation of the covenant with Yahweh and the restoration of the nation politically. 


===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Ezra" is named for the events of the book which focus on the pepole who returned to Israel under the leadership of the priest Ezra. It is likely that the books of Ezra and Nehemiah were originally one book but were later separated. One possible title is "The book about Ezra."

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
===Why were Israelites not allowed to marry people from other nations?===
Yahweh knew that marry foreign wives would cause the people of Israel to worship other [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]].


===Did all of the people of Israel return to their homeland?===
Most of the people remained in Babylon and did not return to the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]]. They had a life in Babylon and desired to remain there but the were not able to sacrifice in the temple. The [[:en:obe:kt:remnant|remnant]] who returned to Israel were very [[:en:obe:kt:faithful]] because they returned.

===What was the religious environment like upon the people's return to Israel?===
Although the people returning to Israel committed significant [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sins]], the [[:en:obe:kt:wordofgod|word of God]] always brought them to [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]] and restored their relationship with Yahweh. In addition to this, the religion of Israel became less centered on the temple and its sacrifices. The building of the walls in Ezra and Nehemiah show the separation of Israel from the world around it both physically and spiritually. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

===What is the meaning of the term Israel?===
Israel is used in many different ways in Scripture. The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel.  This people group is also the [[:en:obe:other:israel|nation of Israel]]. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, which is a reference to the "[[:en:obe:other:kingdomofisrael|kingdom of Israel]]." Ezra uses the term "Israel" to refer to the kingdom of Judah, since the people from the kingdom of Israel have lost their identity through intermarriage.

===Are Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel the same person?===
According to Ezra, Sheshbazzar was a leader or governor of Judah. His exact identity is unknown. Zerubabbel was a descendant of David in Ezra. Because both leaders helped to lay the foundation of the Temple, some have suggested that these are two names for the same man. This is unlikely and unnecessary. 

===Is the book in chronological order?===
No, there are parts of Ezra that do not follow a strict chronological sequence.

===Why is the grammar of Ezra occassionally different than other books?===
Ezra was written in both Hebrew and Aramaic. Ezra 4:8-6:18 and 7:12-26 were written in Aramaic.  In addition to this, the Aramaic language heavily influenced the Hebrew sections of the book. Therefore, the translator may occasionally see different grammatical or syntactical elements in the text.
