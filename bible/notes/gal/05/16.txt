\v 16 \add So\add* I tell you this: Constantly let \add God's\add* Spirit direct you. \add If you do that\add*, you will certainly not do the things that your self-directed nature wants \add you to do\add*.
\v 17 Your self-directed nature opposes \add God's\add* Spirit\f + \ft Or: does not \add want you to do what\add* God's Spirit \add wants you to do\add* \f*, but also his Spirit opposes your self-directed nature. These two are always fighting with\f + \ft Or: opposing \f* each other. The result is that you do not \add constantly\add* do the \add good\add* deeds that you truly desire \add to do\add*.

\v 16 I say, live by the Spirit and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
\v 17 For the flesh lusts against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other that you may not do the things you desire to do.
\v 18 But if the Spirit is leading you, you are not under the law.
