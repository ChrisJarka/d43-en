Here "eyes" are a metonym for sight, and  sight is a metaphor representing his evaluation. AT: "Please accept me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I am not one of your female servants** - Possible meanings are 1) Ruth was not one of Boaz's female servants or 2) Ruth did not think her marriage to Naomi's son granted her any privilege in Bethlehem.
