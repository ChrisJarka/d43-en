\v 24 But they did not listen or incline their ear, but they walked according to the stubborn plans of their wicked heart, so they went backwards not forward.
\v 25 Ever since the day when your fathers went out from the land of Egypt until this day, I sent out every one of my servants, the prophets, to you. Daily persisting and sending out.
\v 26 But they did not listen to me and did not incline their ear but hardened their neck. They were more wicked than their fathers.
