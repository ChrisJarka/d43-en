====== Exclusive ======


**Exclusive language is when somebody excludes somebody else through the words that they use. ** 


**Example from English ** 


A group of __us__ are going to the movies.


//This example uses the word __us__ to refer to a group which does not mean the everyone in the world.// 


**Example from the Bible ** 


My noble friend Theophilus, many people saw the things that Jesus did while he was with __us__, from the time when he started his ministry. They served God by teaching people the message about the Lord Jesus. Many of those who heard what they taught wrote down for us accounts of the things that Jesus did from the time when he began his ministry. Luke 1 1-2 (TFT)


//This example uses the word __us__ which means a separate group. In verse 1:1 __us__ means those people that were physically with Jesus when Jesus was on earth.//
