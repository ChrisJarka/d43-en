===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Yahweh who spoke to her** - This can be translated as "Yahweh, because he spoke to her." 
  * **Have I also seen here the one who sees me?** - Hagar used this rhetorical question to express her amazement that she had seen God. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion]])
  * **the one who sees me**  - "the one who looks after me"
  * **Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi** - Translators may add a footnote that says "Beer-lahai-roi means 'the well of the living one who sees me.'"
  * **Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered** - The word “behold” here draws attention to the fact that the well was in a place the author and his readers knew. You can also translate it here as "it is between Kadesh and Bered" or "in fact, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
