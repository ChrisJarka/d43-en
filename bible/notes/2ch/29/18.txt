\v 18 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah,
and the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of the bread of the presence, with all the vessels thereof.

and, behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.
