\v 1 One day while many people were crowding around him to hear the message from God, Jesus was standing on the shore of Gennesaret Lake, \add which is also called Lake Galilee\add*.
\v 2 He saw two \add fishing\add* boats at the edge of the lake. The fishermen had gone out of the boats and were washing their \add fishing\add* nets \add on the shore\add*. One of the boats belonged to Simon.
\v 3 Jesus got in that boat and asked Simon to push the boat a little bit away from the shore \add so that he could speak to the crowd more easily. Jesus\add* sat in the boat and taught the people \add who were on the shore\add*.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **word of God**  - This phrase usually refers to the Scriptures, but here it means that Jesus was giving the people a message from God.
    * **standing by the lake of Genessaret**- Or, "standing by the lake of Genessaret for a while."
    * **lake of Genessaret** - This refers to the Sea of Galilee.
    * **lying**  - Or, "having been laid."
    * **washing their nets**  - That is, they were cleaning them to be used again to catch fish.
    * **asked him to put it out into the water** - This could also be translated as "asked Peter to move the boat farther into the water." Peter probably got into the boat with Jesus to do this.
    * **Jesus sat down and taught the people**  - Sitting was the normal position for a teacher. When people taught or spoke with authority, they usually sat down.
    * **taught the people out of the boat**  - Or, "was teaching the people from the boat for a while." Jesus was in the boat a short distance from the shore and he was speaking to the people who were on the shore.
