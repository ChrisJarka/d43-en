<usfm> \v 11 Therefore, I, Yahweh the Lord, make this declaration! That as surely as I am alive, because you have polluted my temple with all your disgusting statues of idols and by the other detestable things that you do, I will no longer bless you. I will not pity you or act mercifully toward you. \v 12 One-third of your people will die inside the city because of the plagues they will experience, or by famine. One-third of your people will be killed by your enemies' swords outside the city.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 11 Therefore, as I live–this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration–it is certainly because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable practices and with all your abominations that I myself will diminish you, and my eye will not have pity on you and I will not spare you. \v 12 A third of you will die by plague, and they will be be consumed by famine in your midst. A third of you will fall by the sword surrounding you. Then I will scatter a third of you in every direction, and draw out a sword to chase after them as well. </usfm>
