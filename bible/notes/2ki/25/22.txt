\v 22 And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them
he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.
\v 23 Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor,
they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of
Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
\v 24 And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men, and said to them, Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell
in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
