=== What are 1 and 2 Chronicles about? ===

The purpose of 1 and 2 Chronicles was to retell the genealogy of Adam to Jacob, and the history of Israel leading up to the death of David. These books were probably written for the Jews who returned from exile in Babylon. The purpose was to give the people instructions on how to avoid repeating the sins of their ancestors who were unfaithful to the covenant with Yahweh.

=== How should the title of 1 and 2 Chronicles be translated? === 

The traditional titles of these cases may not be meaningful to project language readers. Translators might consider as an alternative title "The events of the kings."

=== Who wrote 1 and 2 Chronicles? ===

These books seem to contain many different historical accounts that were put together. The writers of Chronicles refer to other resources used in writing their history, but Ezra the Scribe may have edited these stories. The non-biblical sources included “The Chronicles of Samuel the Seer," "The Chronicles of Nathan the Seer," "The Chronicles of Gad the Seer," "The History of Nathan the Prophet," "The Chronicles of Shemaiah the Prophet and Iddo," "The Story of the Prophet Iddo" and "The books of the kings of Judah and Israel."

=== Why are there multiple books which give the history of the kings of Israel? ===

Though Chronicles covers much of the same history as the books of Kings, they do not repeat everything. The books of 1 and 2 Kings have many omissions from the Chronicles, and there are also some additions in one history that is not found in the other. The purpose of Chronicles is not simply to retell the history of Israel and Judah, repeating the books of Kings, but to reaffirm the relationship between Yahweh and his people, even though the kingdom of Israel (and Judah) had been effectively destroyed, and was being rebuilt. To that end, Chronicles focuses on David and Solomon and the reformation accomplished Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah accomplished. Those reformations were to serve encouragements for all the people of Israel and their leaders to obey the Law and to honor Yahweh’s [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenant]] with them, as they work on the rebuilding of the nation and the Temple.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is the kingdom of the Messiah? ===

From this point forward in the history of Israel, a major part of Israel's religion is the hope of the coming Messiah to establish his kingdom. The messiah is the one who will ultimately deliver Israel.

=== What is retribution? ===

Retribution is important in 1 Chronicles. There is a record of the fulfillment of the promise to bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel. Retribution is different from vengeance. Retribution is a just judgment. What the author attempts to show the reader is God's blessing or judgment being given to each generation in accordance with their obedience to the commands of Yahweh.

=== Why are alliances with foreign countries seen as evil? ===

Because Yahweh was their leader and the one who protected Israel, an alliance to defend their nation showed a lack of [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]].  

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the meaning of the term Israel? ===

Israel is used in many different ways in Scripture. The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel.  This people group is also the [[:en:obe:other:israel|nation of Israel]]. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, which is a reference to the "[[:en:obe:other:kingdomofisrael|kingdom of Israel]]." 1 Chronicles references both the northern kingdom of Israel and the whole nation of Israel as "Israel".

=== Why does the author frequently repeat words or phrases? ===

The writer often does this for emphasis or to ensure his reader understands. He also does this to explain to his reader that true worship is not about external obedience to the Law of Moses but it involves the inner attitude of the heart and genuine [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]].

=== What does it mean to "seek God?" ===

The concept of seeking God is very common in Chronicles. It does not imply that God is hidden, rather it is a command to seek to please or to honor God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
