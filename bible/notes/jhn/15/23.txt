===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 All those who hate me, \add it is as though\add* they hate my Father as well.
\v 24 If I had not done among them the \add miracles\add* that no one else ever did, they would not be guilty of the sin \add of rejecting me\add*. But now, \add although\add* they have seen \add those miracles\add*, they have hated both me and my Father.
\v 25 But this has happened in order that these words that have been written in their Scriptures might be fulfilled \f + \ft Or:to fulfill this that \add someone\f + \ft Or: the Psalmist\add* \f* wrote in their Scriptures \f*: 'They hated me for no reason.'

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 Whoever hates me, also hates my Father.
\v 24 If I had not done those works among them, the amazing works of power and miracle that no one else had ever done, they would not be guilty of sin. But now that they have seen what I have done, they display their lack of trust and they reject what they have seen. And they hate me, and they hate my Father.
\v 25 But these words were written in their Scriptures and are now fulfilled: 'They hated me for no reason.'

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 23 He that hates me hates my Father also.
\v 24 If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated
both me and my Father.
\v 25 But this comes to pass, that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a
cause.
