\v 10 Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five
thousand.
\v 11 Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down; likewise also of the
fishes as much as they would.
\v 12 And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be
lost.
