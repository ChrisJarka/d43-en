\v 8 Then it will be throughout all the land'--this is Yahweh's declaration--'two portions of it will be cut off! They will perish so that a third will remain there.
\v 9 I will bring that third through the fire and refine them as silver is refined and will test them as gold is tested. They will call on my name, and I will answer them and say,
'This is my people!' and they will 'Yahweh is my God!'"  [Since the referrant to this is the remnant, I kept the pronouns singular; it seemed appropriate]
