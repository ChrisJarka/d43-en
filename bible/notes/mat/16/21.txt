\v 21 From that time began Jesus to show to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the
elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.
\v 22 And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall never be to thee.
\v 23 But he turned, and said to Peter, Get you behind me, Satan: you are a stumbling block to me: for you mindest not
the things of God, but the things of men.
