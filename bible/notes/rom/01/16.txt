\v 16 I very confidently proclaim the good news about what Christ has done, because this good news is the powerful way in which God saves all people who trust in what Christ has done for them. Specifically, God first saves the Jews who believe the good news, and then he saves non-Jews.
\v 17 By means of this good news God reveals how he puts people right with himself. This is like what a prophet wrote long ago in the Scriptures: "Those whom God puts right with himself will live because they trust him."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I am not ashamed**  - I am confident when I speak about the gospel. (See: Litotes). In Paul's culture, shame was not simply a feeling of embarrassment, but a sense that public opposition to the gospel will not stop him. Alternate translation: "I am always confident when I speak about the gospel, even if many people reject it."
