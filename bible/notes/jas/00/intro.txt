=== What is the Book of James about? ===

The book of James is one of the "General Epistles."  These General Epistles are not addressed to a specific church or individual(s), but are addressed broadly to the whole church. Since ancient times the seven General Epistles have been grouped together:  James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2, and 3 John, Jude.  This letter was written in AD 46-48, just prior to the Jerusalem Council (which convened in AD 48 or 49).
 
It is likely that this letter was written before Paul wrote Galatians, and it is dealing with different matters regarding justification of faith. Justification for James was to prove by one's life and good works that the grace of God was working within you. Justification for Paul was for the initial reception of God's grace and forgiveness, God "demonstrated his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus" (Romans 3:26). Paul and James were addressing different difficulties. Paul made the case for justification by faith and not by any work; James was fighting against those who said there was no need to do good works because they were "justified."
 
James is a topical letter, written much like a sermon that addresses several matters. There are strong pleas and warnings (often repeating key words for emphasis), with many figures of speech taken from nature (wind, flowers, sun, vapor, etc.), the waves of the sea (1:6), astronomy (unchanging sun), biology (stages of life, 1:15), domestic living (a mirror, 1:23), and political award (crown, 1:12), and the encampment of an enemy (4:1). He often forces an obvious answer on his reader (2:4, 5, 6, 7, 14, and others). James' use of portions of the Sermon on the Mount and other teachings of Jesus shows he was familiar with Jesus' teaching. James also shares teaching found in 1 Peter, indicating that they shared a common source (Peter was written much later, AD 62-63).


=== Who wrote the Book of James? ===

The book of James was written by someone called James.  This was possibly James the brother of Jesus, who was a leader in the early church and was part of the Jerusalem council (Acts 15:13).  The Apostle Paul also called him a 'pillar' of the church in Galatians 2:9.  Scholars believe that the book of James was written about 50 years after the birth of Christ.  Since James was a leader of the church in Jerusalem, he probably wrote the book while living there.
