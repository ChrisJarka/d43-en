\v 3 Then the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, Why transgressest you the king’s commandment?
\v 4 Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he listened not to them, that they told Haman, to see whether
Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.
