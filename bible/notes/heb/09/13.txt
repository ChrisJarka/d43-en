\v 13 For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling on the defiled ones can cleanse their flesh;
\v 14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
\v 15 And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant. Since a death has taken place for the forgiveness of the sins that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
