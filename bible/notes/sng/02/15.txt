===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Catch** - This is plural, as if the woman is speaking to more than one man, but most versions translate who she is speaking to as the man, so you could translate this as singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **the foxes** - These animals look like small dogs and were often used in love poetry to represent eager young men who would spoil a young woman. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for us ... our vineyard** - The words "us" and "our" could possibly be 1) exclusive, referring to the woman herself, as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:01|1:4]], or 2) inclusive, referring to the woman and the man, or 3) exclusive, referring to the woman and the rest of her family. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **foxes** - Another possible meaning is "jackals," a type of thin wild dog with long legs.
  * **the little foxes that spoil** - Foxes spoil or destroy vineyards by digging holes and eating vines and grapes. This could be a metaphor for young men who spoil young women. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in blossom** - That is, the vineyard is healthy and the grapes have appeared, but they are not ready for harvest. This could be a metaphor for a young lady ready for marriage and bearing children. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:12|2:13]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
