**What is Exodus about?**\\
Exodus appears to be a continuation of the previous book, Genesis. Exodus means "exit" or "depart." It is the account of the trials and slavery endured by Israel in Egypt, as well as their deliverance. It describes how they received the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of God]] to guide them in the way they should live and relate to God. Exodus is also about how they were forced to wandered in the wilderness before entering the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]]. 

**Who wrote Exodus?**\\

The Bible tells us that Moses composed the book of Exodus. The writers of both the Old and New Testament confirm his part in the composition of the book of Genesis. Ultimately, one can say that God is the author of Genesis because he inspired Moses’s writings.

**What are the different parts of Exodus?**\\
The first half of Exodus is about Israel’s identity, history, and their faith in the One, True God. The second half is about the Law of God and shows Israel's failure to obey it. The Law of Yahweh was given on Mount Sinai and was about the [[:en:obe:kt:worship]] of Yahweh, relationship with others, and the protection of human lives, family and property. Exodus includes instructions about how to build the [[:en:obe:kt:tabernacle|Tabernacle]], which the people of Israel carried through the wilderness. 

**What is the significance of deliverance of God's people in Exodus?**\\
Deliverance is a key theme in the book of Exodus because it shows God as the creator and savior of his people. After the time of the patriarchs, God has now metaphorically given birth to the nation of Israel as his special, chosen people. After their production of the golden calf, God becomes more directive in his relationship with Israel. This is also due to God's holiness and Israel's inability to rightly worship Yahweh. 

**How does Exodus relate to the fulfillment of the promises given to Abraham?**\\
Exodus begins to show the fulfillment of the promise that Abraham would have many descendants.  These descendants are becoming a great nation. An additional covenantal arrangement also begins at Mount Sinai. This covenant is between God and his people, Israel.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**What is the Jewish passover?**\\
The Jewish cultural identity is rooted in the Law of Moses and the celebration of Passover.  The Passover feast is a remembrance of Israel's exodus from Egypt.  


**What was the Law of Moses to the people of Israel?**\\

The law of Moses was a sacrificial system, a way to maintain peace in the land, a provision for the covering for sin, instructions for their general welfare and a way to maintain a right relationship with the Lord. One aspect of the Law was the presence of the tabernacle where God would dwell among his people.

**What does it mean that Israel was to be a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation?"**
Holiness is a common theme in Exodus. In the ancient near east, just as a priest was reserved to the service of one God, Israel was to be reserved for the worship of yahweh.  Additionally, they were to be set apart from the other nations of the world because of their devotion to Yahweh,  their king.  

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**Why are the details of the construction of the tabernacle in chapters 25-32 repeated in chapters 35-39?**\\

**Are the events in chronological order?**\\
While most of the events follow a chronological order, not all of the events are in a strict chronological sequence.
