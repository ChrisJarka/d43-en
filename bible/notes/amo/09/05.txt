\p
\v 5 For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, is he that touches the land and it melteth, and all that dwell therein shall
mourn; and it shall rise up wholly like the River, and shall sink again, like the River of Egypt;
\v 6 it is he that builds his chambers in the heavens, and has founded his vault upon the earth; he that calls
for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the face of the earth; Jehovah is his name.
