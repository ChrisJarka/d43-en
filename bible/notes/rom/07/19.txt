====== Romans 07:19-21 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 19 I do not do the good things that I want to do. Instead, it is evil things that I do not want to do that I do. \v 20 Because I do \add evil things\add* that I do not want to do, it is not that I do \add evil things because I want to\add*. Instead, \add I do them because\add* my self-directed nature, which permeates me \f + \ft personification \f*, \add causes me to do them\add*. \v 21 I find, then, that what always happens is that when I want to do what is good, there is an evil \add desire\add* present within me that \f + \ft personification \f* \add prevents me from doing good\add*. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 19 I do not do the good things that I want to do. Instead, it is evil things that I do not want to do that I do. \v 20 When I do evil things that I do not want to do, it is not that really I that do those things. Instead, something else is making me sin: it is the fact that I am imperfect that makes me sin. \v 21 I find, then, that what always happens is that when I want to do what is good, there is an evil desire present within me that prevents me from doing good. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 19 For the good that I want I do not do, but the evil that I do not want, that I do. \v 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, then it is no longer I who am acting, but rather sin that lives in me. \v 21 I find, then, the principle in me that I want to do what is good, but that evil is actually present in me. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For the good that I want I do not do**  - Alternate translation: "I do not do the things that are pleasing to God that I want to do." Paul is personifying good and evil. They are being described as living agents having authority and his actions are a result of that influence. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:personification|Personification]] and [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **but the evil I do not want, that I do**  - Alternate translation: "but I do the things that are not pleasing to God that I do not want to do." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]]) This is a contrast of the good and righteous things he desires to do with the sinful, immoral, and unrighteous behavior that is present in him.
