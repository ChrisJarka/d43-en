\v 7 And he went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.
\v 8 And after a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a
swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
\v 9 And he took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave to them,
and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.
