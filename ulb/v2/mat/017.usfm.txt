\c 17
\p
\v 1 And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain
apart:
\v 2 and he was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.
\v 3 And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him.
\v 4 And Peter answered, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if you wilt, I will make here three
tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
\v 5 While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is
my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear you him.
\v 6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
\v 7 And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
\v 8 And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, save Jesus only.
\p
\v 9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of
man be risen from the dead.
\v 10 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come?
\v 11 And he answered and said, Elijah indeed cometh, and shall restore all things:
\v 12 but I say to you, that Elijah is come already, and they knew him not, but did to him whatever they would. Even so
shall the Son of man also suffer of them.
\v 13 Then understood the disciples that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.
\p
\v 14 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, and saying,
\v 15 Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for oft-times he falls into the fire, and
oft-times into the water.
\v 16 And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.
\v 17 And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear
with you? bring him hither to me.
\v 18 And Jesus rebuked him; and the demon went out of him: and the boy was cured from that hour.
\p
\v 19 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out?
\v 20 And he says to them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard
seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to
you.
\v 21 \f + Many authorities, some ancient, insert v. 21. \fqa But this kind goes not out save by prayer and
fasting.\f*
\p
\v 22 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men;
\v 23 and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised up. And they were exceeding sorry.
\p
\v 24 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your teacher
pay the half-shekel?
\v 25 He saith, Yea. And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke first to him, saying, What think thou, Simon? the kings of
the earth, from whom do they receive toll or tribute? from their sons, or from strangers?
\v 26 And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, Therefore the sons are free.
\v 27 But, lest we cause them to stumble, go you to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first comes up; and
when you have opened his mouth, you shall find a shekel: that take, and give to them for me and thee.
