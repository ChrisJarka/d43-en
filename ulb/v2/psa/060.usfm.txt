\d For the Chief Musician; set to Shushan Eduth. Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and
with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and struck of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand.

\v 1 O God you have cast us off, you have broken us down;
\q You have been angry; oh restore us again.
\q
\v 2 You have made the land to tremble; you have tore it:
\q Heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
\q
\v 3 You have showed your people hard things:
\q You have made us to drink the wine of staggering.
\q
\v 4 You have given a banner to them that fear thee,
\q That it may be displayed because of the truth. \qs [Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 5 That your beloved may be delivered,
\q Save with your right hand, and answer us.
\q
\v 6 God has spoken in his holiness: I will exult;
\q I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
\q
\v 7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;
\q Ephraim also is the defence of my head;
\q Judah is my sceptre.
\q
\v 8 Moab is my washpot;
\q Upon Edom will I cast my shoe:
\q Philistia, shout you because of me.
\q
\v 9 Who will bring me into the strong city?
\q Who has led me to Edom?
\q
\v 10 Hast not thou, O God, cast us off?
\q And you go not forth, O God, with our hosts.
\q
\v 11 Give us help against the adversary;
\q For vain is the help of man.
\q
\v 12 Through God we shall do valiantly;
\q For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
