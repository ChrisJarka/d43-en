\v 5 And he said to them, "Which of you will have a friend, then go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend to me three loaves of bread
\v 6 because a friend of mine just came in from the road and I do not have anything to set before him.'
\v 7 And the one inside answering may say, 'Do not bother me. The door is already shut and my children are with me in bed. I am not able to get up and give bread to you.'
\v 8 I say to you, even if he does not get up and give bread to him because he is his friend, he will get up because of his friend's shameless persistence and give him bread, as many loaves as he needs.
