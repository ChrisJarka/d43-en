\v 8 And now you are planning to fight against the kingdom that Yahweh established to be governed by David's descendants. It is true that you have a huge army, and you and your soldiers have brought with you the golden statues of calves that Jeroboam's workers made to be your gods.
\v 9 But you drove out the priests that Yahweh appointed, men who are descendants of Aaron the first high priest. You also drove out the descendants of Levi, and you appointed the priests that you wanted, like the people of other countries do. And so one may even come to set himself apart for the work of a priest, even sacrificing a young bull and seven rams as a sign of his ordination and his dedication to become a priest. But what kind of priest is he? He is consecrated to serve idols that are not gods at all!

<usfm>
\v 8 So now you plan to resist the kingdom of Yahweh that is held within the hand of the descendants of David, because you are a large army, and you have the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods.
\v 9 Have you not driven out Yahweh's priests, the descendants of Aaron, and the Levites? Have you not made for yourselves priests in the manner of the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to set himself apart for service as a priest by sacrificing a young bullock and seven rams, becomes a priest of what are not gods.
