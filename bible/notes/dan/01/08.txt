\v 8 But I decided that I would not eat the kind of food that the king ate, or drink the wine that he drank, because that would make me ritually defiled\f + \ft Or: unacceptable to God \f*. So I asked Ashpenaz to allow me to eat and drink other things.
\v 9 God had caused Ashpenaz to greatly respect me,
\v 10 but he was worried about what I suggested. He said, "My master, the king, has commanded that you eat the kinds of food and drink that he does. If \add you eat other things and as a result\add* you become more thin and pale than the other young men who are your age, he will \add order his soldiers to\add* cut off my head because of what you have done!"

\v 8 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the kingâ€™s dainties, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
\v 9 Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.
\v 10 And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths that are of your own age? so would you endanger my head with the king.
