\v 15 Those who think like this are not wise in the way that God wants them to be. Instead, they are only thinking and acting like people who do not honor God. They think and act according to their own evil desires. They do what the demons want them to do.
\v 16 Keep in mind that people who have such attitudes do not control themselves. They take from other people and act like what they are doing is right, but it is wrong, and they do every sort of evil.
\v 17 God gives us a wisdom that comes from heaven, and his wisdom is first of all morally pure. That wisdom shows us how to make peace with others. That wisdom teaches us to be kind to others and that true wisdom shows us how to give up our rights and, it teaches us when we should give them up. God's wisdom overflows with kindness to those who are not deserving, and to do good works that have lasting results. God's wisdom sees people as having equal worth. This wisdom teaches people not to tell lies with words or by the way they live.
\v 18 Those who act peaceably toward others cause the others to also act peaceably, with the result that they all live together acting righteously.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above. Instead, it is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
\v 16 For where there are jealousy and strife, there is confusion and every vile practice.
\v 17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, responsive, full of mercy and good fruit, unweakening, and sincere.
\v 18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace among those who make peace.
