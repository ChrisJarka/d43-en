In English there are direct or non-direct, or indirect, quotations.


    * **DIRECT**  quotations are when someone reports someone else’s speech the way the other person would have said it.  (She said, “Come.” and then he said, “I will come.”) Direct quotations are written between quote marks “ ”.
    * **INDIRECT**  or **NON-DIRECT**  quotations are when someone reports basically what another person said, but from his own perspective. (She told him to come. He said he would come.) The pronouns change, and often there is a change in the verb tense.  Indirect quotations are written without quote marks “ ”.

===== Examples from English =====

//**Direct Quotations**//

  * John said, “I am reading a book.”

“I am reading a book” is a direct quotation as it is the words John spoke. The word “I” refers to John, not to the person reporting what John said.

  * “I need to go to the store”, said my wife. 

The words “I need to go to the store” is a direct quotation as it is exactly what the wife said.

//**Indirect Quotations**//

  * John said that he was reading a book.

The phrase “that he was reading a book” is an indirect quotation as someone else is reporting what another person said.

  * My wife said that she needed to go to the store.

The words “that she needed to go to the store is an indirect quotation as it is words that someone else used to describe what another speaker said.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Luke 5:14 has an example of an indirect quote and a direct quote in the same verse:

  * //He instructed him to tell no one//, is an indirect quote.
  * //He told him, "Go on your way, and show yourself to the priest."//is a direct quote.
Luke 17:20 is another example where there is an indirect quote and a direct quote in the same verse:

  * //Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, //  is an indirect quote.
  * //Jesus answered them and said, "The kingdom of God is not something that can be observed."//is a direct quote.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Some languages have more than one kind of **NON-DIRECT ** quotations. If that is true of your language, consider the best non-direct quotation you should use.

Remember that **DIRECT** quotes in the source text should be direct quotes in the translated text. Perhaps your language organizes the sentence differently, you should then organize the sentence to keep the direct quote.
