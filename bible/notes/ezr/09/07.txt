\v 7 From the days of our ancestors until now we have been in great guilt. In our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests were given into the hand of kings of this world, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder and ashamed faces, as we are today.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the days of our ancestors** - "the time when our ancestors were alive"
  * **in great guilt ... In our iniquities** - The abstract nouns "guilt" and "iniquity" can be translated as an adjective and a verb, respectively. AT: "very guilty ... Because of the evil deeds we did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **we ... were given into the hand of kings** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "you gave us ... into the hand of kings" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **into the hand of kings of this world** - The writer speaks of God allowing the kings to do whatever they wanted to do to the Jews as if God had put small objects into the hands of the kings of this world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder and ashamed faces** - The sword is a metonym for people killing other people. The abstract nouns "captivity" and "plunder" can be stated as verb phrases. And, "faces" is a synecdoche representing the whole person. AT: "to our enemies to kill us, to capture us, to steal from us, and to cause us shame" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
