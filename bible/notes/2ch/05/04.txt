===== translationNotes: =====

  * **furnishing** - This refers to all of the bowls and tools that were used in the house of God. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:04:19|4:19]]
  * **all the assembly of Israel** - Here "all" is a generalization meaning very many Israelites. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted** - This is an exaggeration that emphasizes the great number of animals that were sacrificed. This can be stated in active form. AT: "sacrificing more sheep and oxen than anyone could count" or "sacrificing very many sheep and oxen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
