=== What is Book of Nahum about? ===

Jonah and Nahum are two different chapters about the city of Nineveh. While Jonah was about its repentance, Nahum was about its destruction. The chief reasons for Yahweh’s destruction of Nineveh was their ruthless military power and their greed. The people of Nineveh were immoral and ruthless people. The prophecy ends with a celebration by the prophet Nahum and the enemies of Assyria when Nineveh was destroyed. Although the book is a prophecy against Assyria, it is intended to give hope to Judah.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 
Translators may decided to translate this traditional title "The book of Nahum" in a way that is more clear to the readers.They may decide to call it, "The sayings of Nahum." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]).

=== Who wrote Nahum? ===

It is likely that Nahum wrote this book. He was a [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophet]] from Elkosh, an unknown city which was probably in Judah. The book was written more than 100 years after the book of Jonah but before the fall of Nineveh, about 612 BC. The prophet also mentions the sack of Thebes, which occurred about 663 BC, so this is the time-frame in which Nahum was written.
