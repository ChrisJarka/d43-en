====== English Parts of Speech ======

**(not an exhaustive list but covers the basics)**

The **VERB** is either an action or a state-of-being word such as is, are, was. The portion of the sentence which contains the verb is called the predicate. More detailed information can be found on [[:en:ta:translate:verbs|Verbs]].

**NOUNS** are words that represent a person, place, thing or idea. Proper Nouns are capitalized and refer to a specific entity (e.g. Peter, Calvary Baptist); common nouns are generic (e.g. disciples, church). Nouns have various roles in a sentence, including: subject, appositive (which renames a subject), nominatives, and objects. Also see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns|Abstract Nouns]] or [[:en:ta:translate:adjectivalnoun|Adjectival Nouns]]

**PRONOUNS** take the place of nouns and include such words as he, she, it, they and we. More detailed pages on pronouns can be found on [[:en:ta:translate:singularpronoun|Singular Pronouns]] and [[:en:ta:translate:pluralpronouns|Plural Pronouns]].

**CONJUNCTIONS ** are very common words in English and join things (i.e. words, sentences). Examples of conjunctions include: and, or, but, for, yet and nor. Correlative conjunctions contrast things and must be used in pairs: both/and; either/or; neither/nor; not only/but also.

**PREPOSITIONS ** are words that begin phrases which connect a noun or verb with more detail. For example, "The boat was //off the shore//." Off is a preposition (in an adverb phrase) that gives location information. Another example would be "The crowd //around Jesus// grew in numbers." Around is a preposition (in an adjective phrase) helping us understand which crowd. Preposition examples include: aboard, above, among, before, behind, beyond, except, inside, through, toward, underneath, within.

**ARTICLES** are the term used to describe the words: a, an, the. "The" is a definite article which means a specific one (e.g. the dog) instead of a generic description such as "a dog." 'A' is used preceding words that start with a consonant letter (e.g. a book); 'An' is used preceding words beginning with a vowel (e.g. an egg). Articles are actually part of a larger group of words called adjectives.

**ADJECTIVES** are a group of words that describe nouns and convey such things as quantity, size and color; they help us identity 'which one' or 'what kind.' Some times people use adjectives to tell which one, and sometimes people use them to tell something about them. For example - My eldest sister (“Eldest” tells which one.) My elderly father (“Elderly” tells something about my father). Also see: [[:en:ta:translate:adjectivalnoun|Adjectival Noun]]

**ADVERBS** are a group of words that describe verbs (or adjectives) and tell such things as how, when, why, to what extent or where. The majority of adverbs end in 'ly.',

**GERUNDS** are verbs changed into nouns by adding 'ing' to the end of the verb. For example: Reading delivers treasures.

**INFINITIVES** are words with 'to' placed in front of a verb. For example, 'To learn the details of English is challenging.'
