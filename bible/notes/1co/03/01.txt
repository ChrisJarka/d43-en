====== 1 Corinthians 03:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, \add when I was with you previously\add*, I was not able to teach you as \add I would teach people who are controlled by the Holy\add* Spirit \f + \ft Or:\add whom the Holy\add* Spirit\add controls\add* \f*. Instead, \add I had to teach you as I would teach\add* people whom their self-directed nature controls. \add I taught very simple concepts to you who had recently believed\add* in Christ, \add as a parent would speak very simple words\add* to a baby.
\v 2 I did not \add teach\add* you \add things that were difficult for you to understand, just like a woman does not\add* give \add her baby\add* solid food \add that the baby cannot chew and digest\add*. \add And just like a woman\add* \add gives her baby milk\f + \ft Or: breast-feeds her baby\add* \f*\add , I taught you simple spiritual concepts\add*, because at that time you were not able to understand difficult things. And you are still not able to understand difficult concepts,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 And Christian brothers and sisters, I wanted to address you not only as Christians but also as spiritual people who are maturing, but I cannot. You are so controlled by your sinful natures, your flesh, that I must speak to you, not as to mature Christians, but as I would speak to babies, babies who are controlled by their sin.
\v 2 I fed you spiritual milk because you were babies. I could not feed you meatier fare because you couldn't take what I would give to you. Even now, it is clear, you are not ready.

\v 1 And brothers and sisters, I could not speak to you as spiritual people, but instead as to fleshly people, as babes in Christ.
\v 2 I fed you milk, and not meat, for you were not ready for meat. And even now you are not ready.
