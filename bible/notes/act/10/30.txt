\v 30 Cornelius replied, "About this time four days ago I was praying \add to God\add* in my house, \add as I regularly do\add* at three o'clock in the afternoon. Suddenly a man whose clothes \add shone\add* brightly stood in front of me,
\v 31 and said, 'Cornelius, when you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* have prayed, you have been heard by God \f + \ft Or:God has heard \add when\add* you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* have prayed \add to him\add* \f*. He has also noticed that you have \add often\add* given money to \add help\add* poor people, \add and he is pleased with that\add*.
\v 32 So now, send \add messengers to go\add* to Joppa city\add , in order\add* to ask Simon whose other name is Peter to come \add here\add*.

\v 30 Cornelius said, "Four days ago, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house until this very hour; and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing.
\v 31 He said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard by God, and your gifts to the poor have reminded God about you.
\v 32 So send someone to Joppa, and call to you a man named Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He is staying in the house of a tanner named Simon, by the seaside.'
\v 33 So at once I sent for you. You are kind to have come. Now then, we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear everything that you have been instructed by the Lord to say."
