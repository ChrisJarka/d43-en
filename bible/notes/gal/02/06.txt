<usfm>
\v 6 The \add leaders in Jerusalem\add*, whom your new teachers respect, did not add anything to what I preach. \add And I would add that\add* what status those leaders had did not influence me, because God does not favor certain\f + \ft Or: important \f* persons \f + \ft idiom \f* more than others.
\v 7 Instead of those leaders adding to the message that I tell people, they understood that I had been given the good message \f + \ft Or:God had given the good message to me \f* so that I might proclaim it to the non-Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*, just like \add God\add* had given the good message to Peter so that he might tell it to those who are Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 8 That is, just like \add God\add* had empowered\f + \ft Or: authorized \f* Peter in order that he might be an apostle \add to bring God's message\add* to the Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*, he also had empowered\f + \ft Or: authorized \f* me in order that I might be an apostle to \add bring his message to\add* the non-Jews.

\v 6 But those who seemed to be leaders  contributed nothing to me. Whatever they were does not matter to me. God does not accept manâ€™s favorites..
\v 7 Instead, they saw that I had been entrusted to proclaim the gospel to the uncircumcised Gentiles, just as Peter was to proclaim the gospel to the circumcised Jews,
\v 8 for God who worked in Peter as the apostle to the circumcised Jews also worked in me to the Gentiles.
