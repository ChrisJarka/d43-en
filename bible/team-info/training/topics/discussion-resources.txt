====== Quoting Resources in Discussions ======


We definitely want you to use your various resources to help you figure out what we need to do and say in the part of the project where you are working. And it is not only OK, but desired that you talk about them in the Discussion section of the pages as needed or as helpful.


There is, however, a subtle but important cautionâ€“you can discuss things you read in copyrighted sources, and even refer to the facts that you learned from them or where you learned them. But do not copy any text verbatim from those resources into the Discussion.


The Discussion section will not be published with the apps. However, anything that is on the Internet falls under a higher standard of scrutiny for copyright violation. It is too easy for it to be passed on or copied and lead to a violation down the road. Therefore, we have chosen to be very careful not to approach the line.
