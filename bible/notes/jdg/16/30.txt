\v 30 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the
lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than they that he killed in his
life.
\v 31 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between
Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
