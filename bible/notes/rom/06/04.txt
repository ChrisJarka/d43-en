We \add were baptized\add* to \add signify that we would\add* continually conduct our lives in a new way, just like Christ was caused to live again in a new way by the great \add power\add* of \add God his\add* Father.
\v 5 Because of our close relationship with Christ, we have \add separated ourselves from the former way in which we conducted our lives\add*, just like he \add was separated from his physical life when he\add* died \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

\v 4 We were buried therefore with him by placement into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so even we might walk in newness of life.
\v 5 For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, instead of death we will also be partakers of his resurrection.
