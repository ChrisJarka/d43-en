\v 19 God said, "Truly Sarah your wife is about to bear you a son, and you must name him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant with his descendants after him.
\v 20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I hereby bless him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him abundantly. He will be the father of twelve leaders of tribes, and I will make him become a great nation.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Truly Sarah...will bear**  - This is intended to correct Abraham's wrong belief that Sarah could not bear a child and his suggestion that God make his covenant with Ishmael.
  * **you must name him**- The word "you" refers to Abraham. 
  * **As for Ishmael** - The words "As for" show that God is switching from talking about the baby that would be born to talking about Ishmael."
  * **leaders of tribes**  - "chiefs" or "rulers"
  * **Behold**  - The word "behold" here draws attention to the action that comes next.
  * **I will make him fruitful** - This is figurative language for "I will cause him to have many children."
  * **and will multiply him abundantly** - "and I will cause him to have many descendants."
  * **But my covenant…**  - God put "my covenant" at the beginning of the sentence to show that this is what would distinguish the son that Sarah would bear from Ishmael. God would bless Ishmael, but his covenant would be with Isaac, not with Ishmael. If your language uses word order to draw attention to phrases, you should do that here.
