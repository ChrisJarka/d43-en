\v 10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication;
and they shall look to me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall
be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born.
\v 11 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
