\v 2 Many nations will go and say,
\q"Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
\qAnd to the house of the God of Jacob.
\qHe will teach us of his ways,
\qAnd we will walk in his paths."
\qFor out of Zion the law will go forth,
\qAnd the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.
\q
\v 3 He will judge between many peoples,
\qAnd will decide concerning numerous nations far away.
\qThey will beat their swords into plowshares
\qAnd their spears into pruning knifes.
\qNation will not lift up sword against nation,
\qNeither will they learn war any more.
