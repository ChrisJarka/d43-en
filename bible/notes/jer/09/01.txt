===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 1 I wish that my head was like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a spring of water, \q2 and that my eyes were like a fountain of tears. \q1 Then I would cry night and day for all of my people who have been killed \add by their enemies\add*. \q1 \v 2 I wish that I could leave my people and forget them, \q2 and go and live in a shack\f + \ft Or: shelter \f* in the desert, \q1 because they have not remained faithful \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add to Yahweh\add*; \q2 they are a mob of people who deceive others. \b

\p \v 3 \add Yahweh replied to me\add*, \q1 "They use their tongues \add to tell\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* lies \q2 like people shoot \add arrows\add* with bows. \q1 It is because they tell lies that they have become more powerful in this land, \q2 and they do not know me. \q1 </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 1 "I wish that my head could produce as many tears as water from a spring, and that my eyes were like a fountain of tears, \q since I cry night and day for all of my people who have been killed by their enemies. \q \v 2 I wish that I could leave my people and forget them, and go and live in a shack in the desert, \q because they have not remained faithful to Yahweh; they are a mob of people who deceive others. \q \v 3 They use their tongues to tell lies like people shoot arrows with bows. \q They are not powerful because they are faithful, but go about doing wicked things. "They do not know me," Yahweh has said.

\q </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \c 9 \q \v 1 If only my head could produce water, and my eyes be a fountain of tears! \q For I wish to weep day and night for those among the daughter of my people who have been killed. \q \v 2 If only someone would give me a place for travelers in the wilderness to stay, where I could go to abandon my people. \q If only I could leave them, since all of them are adulterers, a band of traitors! \q \v 3 For they say false things with their tongues, which are their deceitful bows, but they are not great in faithfulness on the earth. \q They go out from wicked act to another. They do not know me—this is Yahweh’s declaration. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **If only my head could produce water, and my eyes be a fountain of tears**  - Both of these phrases have similar meanings. Jeremiah means that he wishes he could cry even more tears than he already has. This emphasizes that he is extremely sad because of the people of Israel. (See: Parallelism and Metaphor)
  * **day and night**  - AT: "all the time" (See: Merism)
  * **the daughter of my people**  - See how you translated this in 4:11.
  * **who have been killed **- AT: "whom the enemy has killed" (See: Active Passive)
  * **If only someone would give me a place for travelers in the wilderness to stay**  - "If only someone would give me a shelter in the wilderness where travelers stay"
  * **abandon my people**  - AT: "escape my people"
  * **a band of traitors**  - AT: "a group of people who betray others"
