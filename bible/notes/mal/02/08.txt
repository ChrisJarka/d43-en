<usfm>
\v 8 But, you priests have stopped doing what I wanted you to do. What you have taught people has caused many of them to sin. You have rejected the agreement that I made with the descendants of Levi \add long ago\add*.
\v 9 Therefore I have caused all the people to despise you, and I have caused you to be humiliated, because you have not obeyed me. When you teach people my commands, you do not treat all people equally."

\v 8 But you have turned aside out of the way. You have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,
says Yahweh of armies.
\v 9 In turn have I also made you contemptible and vile before all the people, because you have not kept my ways, but
have shown partiality in your instruction.
