\v 3 The angel of Yahweh appeared to this woman and said to her, “See now, you have been barren, and have had no children, but you will conceive and bear a son.
\v 4 Now therefore be careful, I beg you, and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat no unclean thing.
\v 5 For, see, you have, in fact, conceived; you will bear a son; no razor must come on his head, for the child will be a Nazirite
for God from your womb. He will begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”
