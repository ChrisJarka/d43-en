====== biblical time: year ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the term "year" usually refers to a period of time that lasts about 354 days, according to the 29-day month of a lunar calendar system.

  * In the modern-day solar calendar, however, a year lasts 365 days, based on the amount of time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun.
  * To adjust for the difference between the length of a year in the two calendar systems, an extra month is added to certain years in the lunar calendar.
