====== Verbs ======


===== Description =====

Verbs either link the subject to a descriptive portion of the sentence or express an action or a state-of-being (e.g. am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been). Many languages use more verbs than English does. The portion of the sentence which contains the verb is called the predicate.

=== Luke 8:10 ===

"Jesus said to them, "You have been given the privilege of understanding the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but the rest of the people will only be taught with parables, so that 'seeing they will not really see, and hearing they will not really understand.'"

  * **seeing they will not really see**  -  **(2)** "though they see, they will not perceive." **(3)** In some languages, the verbs "see" and "seeing" will require an object. **(4)** Alternate translation: "though they see things, they will not understand them" or "though they see things happen, they will not understand what they mean." **(5)** (See: Verbs)

=== Acts 1:5 ===

"You heard from me that John indeed baptized with water but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit in a few days."

  * **John baptized with water**  -  **(3)** Some languages may require an object for "baptize." **(4)** Alternate translation: "John baptized people with water" or "John baptized them with water." **(5)** (See: Verbs)
