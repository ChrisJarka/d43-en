\v 11 As he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly marvelling.
\v 12 When Peter saw this, he answered the people, "You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you  fix your eyes on us, as if we had made him to walk by our own power or godliness ?

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **as**  - "while" or "at the time"
  * **the porch**  - a row of pillars covered by a roof, and open on one side. "Veranda" might be a good translation. Solomon's Porch was very large.
  * **greatly marveling **  - "full of surprise", or "astonished", or "full of awe"
  * **When Peter saw this**  - "When Peter saw the crowd growing", or "When Peter saw the people" (UDB)
  * **You men of Israel**  - "Fellow Israelites" (UDB). The word for “men” here means specifically males, but the women would have understood that they were being addressed as well. If the word for “men” in your language would be understood this way, good. If not, a more general term for “people” may be used.
