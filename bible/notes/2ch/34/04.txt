\v 4 While he directed them, his workers tore down the altars where people worshiped Baal. They smashed the altars that were near those altars, where people burned incense. They smashed the poles \add to honor the goddess\add* Asherah and the idols and statues. They smashed them to bits and scattered the bits over the graves of those who had offered sacrifices to them.
\v 5 They burned the bones of the priests \add who had offered sacrifices\add*; they burned them on their own altars. In that way Josiah caused Jerusalem and other places in Judah to be acceptable places to worship Yahweh again.

\v 4 While he directed them, his workers tore down the altars where people worshiped Baal. They smashed the altars that were near those altars, where people burned incense. They smashed the poles to honor the goddess Asherah and the idols carved from wood or stone and metal statues. They smashed them to bits and scattered the bits over the graves of those who had offered sacrifices to them.
\v 5 They burned the bones of the priests who had offered sacrifices; they burned them on their own altars. In that way Josiah caused Jerusalem and other places in Judah to be acceptable places to worship Yahweh again.

\v 4 The people broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; he cut apart the incense altars that were above them. He broke the Asherah poles and the carved figures, and the cast metal figures in pieces until they were dust. He scattered the dust on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
\v 5 He burned the bones of their priests on their altars. In this way, he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in his presence** - "in Josiah's presence" 
  * **he cut apart ... He broke ... He scattered ... He burned** - Josiah would have commanded his workers to do these things. AT: "he had them cut apart ... He commanded them to break ... He had them scatter ... He commanded had them burn" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **He burned the bones of their priests on their altars** - This means that the bones of the priests who offered sacrifices on the altars to the false gods were burned on the altars that the priests had previously made sacrifices on. 
  * **dust** - very small pieces that could be carried away by the wind
  * **he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem** - This speaks of Josiah causing Judah and Jerusalem to be acceptable to Yahweh as if he made them physically clean. AT: "he caused Judah and Jerusalem to be acceptable again to Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
