\v 12 On that night I will go through all the land of Egypt, and I will kill all the oldest males in Egypt, both humans and animals. By doing this, I will punish all the gods in Egypt. It is I, Yahweh God, who am speaking to you!
\v 13 The blood that you smear on the doorways will be a mark to show me the houses in which you Israelites live. When I see the blood, I will pass over those houses, and I will not harm the people who live there when I come to punish the Egyptians.
\p
\v 14 Each year, you must celebrate this festival on this day to remember what I, Yahweh, have done for you. In all the generations to come, each year you must celebrate this festival. It must continue forever.

\v 12 For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night and attack all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments. I am Yahweh.
\v 13 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are. When I see the blood, I will pass over you, and this  plague will not be on you to destroy you when I attack the land of Egypt.
\v 14 This day will become a memorial day for you, and you will observe it as a festival to Yahweh. Throughout your generations you will observe it as an ordinance forever.
