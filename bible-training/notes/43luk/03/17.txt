\v 17 He \add is like a man\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add who wants to\add* clear away the grain on the ground where it has been threshed \f + \ft Or:they have threshed it \f*. That man \add uses\add* a huge fork \add to throw the grain into the air\add* to separate the wheat from the chaff \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and then he cleans up the threshing area. \add Similarly, God\add* will \add separate righteous people from the evil people, like a man who\add* gathers the wheat into his storage area, and then he will burn \add those who are like\add* chaff with a fire that will never be put out\f + \ft Or: that will burn forever \f*."

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (John continues teaching about the Messiah.)
    * **winnowing fork**  - a tool used to toss freshly picked wheat up in the air to separate the grain (seed) from the seed casings that aren't wanted. The heavier seed would fall back down and the unwanted parts would be taken away by the wind.
    * **threshing floor**  - a place where the grain (seed) is separated from the chaff (unwanted casing of the seed).
    * **storehouse** - This is where the grain would be kept safe in order to use later. It could also be translated as, "barn" or, "granary."
    * **burn up the chaff**  - When the grain (seed) is separated from the chaff (unwanted casings), then the grain is stored away for later used. The chaff isn't useful for anything, and so it was burned and destroyed.
    * **wheat**- a grain used to make bread
    * **text**  - note
