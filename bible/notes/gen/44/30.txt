\v 30 Now, therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his life is bound up in the boy’s life,
\v 31 it will come about, when he sees that the boy is not with us that he will die. And your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
\v 32 For your servant became a guarantee for the boy to my father and said, 'If I do not bring him to you, then I will bear the guilt to my father for ever.'
