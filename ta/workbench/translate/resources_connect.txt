====== Connecting Statement and General Information in the Notes ======

//This page answers the question: What are Connecting Statements and General Information?//

Depend: inclusive we ; pronouns

==== Description ====

Sometimes at the top of the list of notes, there are notes that start with **Connecting Statement** or **General Information**. 

A connecting statement tells how the scripture in a chunk is related to scripture in earlier chunks.  The following are some of the kinds of information in the connecting statements.

  * whether this chunk is at the beginning, middle or end of a passage
  * who is speaking
  * who the speaker is speaking to

A general information note tells about issues in the chunk that cover more than one phrase.  The following are some of the kinds of information that appear in a general information statement.
 
  * who pronouns refer to
  * important background or implied information that is needed to understand the text in the chunk
  * Logical arguments and conclusions

These notes are to help you understand the passage better and be aware of issues that you might need to address in translation. 

==== Examples ====

=== Whether this chunk is at the beginning, continuation, or end of a passage === 

> 26Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip and said, “Arise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This road is in a desert.) 27He arose and went. Behold, there was a man from Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship. 28He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah. (Acts 8:26-28 ULB)

  * **General Information:** - This is the beginning of the part of the story about Philip and the man from Ethiopia. Verse 27 gives background information about the man from Ethiopia. (See: Background Information)

This note alerts you to the beginning of a new part of a story and to some background information so you can be aware of them and use your language's ways of showing these things.


=== Who is speaking === 

> <sup>17</sup>For he was one of us and received his share of the benefits of this ministry." <sup>18</sup>(Now this man bought a field with the earnings of his evil act. Then he fell head first, and his body burst wide open, and all his bowels poured out. <sup>19</sup>It became known to all those living in Jerusalem that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.) (Acts 1:17-19 ULB)

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Peter continues his speech to the believers that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:01:15|1:16]]. 

This note tells you that it is still Peter speaking in verse 17 so you can mark that clearly in  your language.

=== Who the speaker is speaking to === 

> 1Jesus said to his disciples, “It is certain there will be things that can cause us to sin, but woe to that person through whom they come! 2It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble. (Luke 17:1-2 ULB)

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues teaching, but he directs his attention back to his disciples. This is still the same part of the story and the same day that begin in 15:3.

=== Who pronouns refer to ===

>20And Isaiah is very bold and says,
>"I was found by those who did not seek me.  
>I appeared to those who did not ask for me."
>21But to Israel he says, "All the day long I reached out my hands >to a disobedient and resistant people." (Romans 10:20-21 ULB)

  * **General Information:** - Here the words “I,” “me,” and “my” refer to God.

This note lets you know how the pronouns refer to. You may need to add something so that readers will know that Isaiah is not speaking for himself, but is quoting what God said.

23You should no longer drink water, but rather you should take a little wine for the stomach and your frequent sicknesses. 24The sins of some people are openly known, and they go before them into judgment. But some follow later. 25Likewise, some good works are openly known, but even the others cannot be hidden. (1 Timothy 5:23-25 ULB)

  * **General Information:** - Verse 23 seems to be a personal note inserted here to Timothy. Then in verse 24, Paul continues what he was saying in verse 22.

This note lets you know that Paul's instruction to Timothy in verse 23 is not related to what he is saying in 24 and 25 about people's sins and good works. 

=== Important background or implied information ===

> 1But Saul, still speaking threats even of murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest 2and asked him for letters for the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. (Acts 9:1-2 ULB)

  * **General Information:** - The story shifts back to Saul. These verses give background information telling us what Saul has been doing since the stoning of Stephen. (See: Background Information)

> 6Jesus told this parable, “Someone had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and looked for fruit on it but found none. 7The man said to the gardener, 'Look, for three years I came and tried to find fruit on this fig tree and found none. Cut it down. Why let it waste the ground?' (Luke 13:6-7 ULB)

  * **General Information:** - Jesus begins to tell a parable to explain his last statement, “But if you do not repent, all of you will also perish.” (See: Parables)

> 7Now Herod, the tetrarch, heard about all that was happening and he was very disturbed, because it was said by some that John the Baptist had risen from the dead, 8and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the ancient prophets had risen to life again. 9Herod said, "I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?" And Herod tried to find a way to see Jesus.  (Luke 9:7-9 ULB)

  * **General Information:** - These verses are not part of the main storyline; they give information about Herod.

=== Logical arguments and conclusions === 

><sup>25</sup>For David says about him,
>'I saw the Lord always before my face,
>for he is beside my right hand so that I should not be moved.
><sup>26</sup>Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced.
>Also, my flesh will live in confidence. (Acts 2:25-26 ULB)\\

  * **General Information:** - Here Peter recalls a passage spoken by David that relates to Jesus' having been crucified and risen from the grave.

The general information note above explains why Peter tells what David had said.
