===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **ant** - An ant is a small insect that lives underground or in a self-build hill. They usually live in groups of thousands, and they can lift things that are much bigger than they are.
    * **consider her ways** - AT: "think about how the ant behaves" (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **commander, officer, or ruler** - These three words basically mean the same thing and are used to emphasized that no one has formal authority over the individual ant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
    * **summer** - That is the time of the year when there is enough food, but it is also the time when you have to store food so you can eat during the other half of the year.
