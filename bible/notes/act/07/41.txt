\v 41 So, they made an image \add out of gold that looked like\add* a calf. Then they sacrificed \add animals and offered other things\add* to \add honor\add* that idol, and they sang and danced to honor the idol that they themselves had made.
\v 42 So God rejected them. He abandoned them to worship the sun, moon and stars in the sky. This agrees with the words that one of the prophets wrote that God said,
\q You Israelite \add people\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, when you \add repeatedly\add* killed animals and offered them as sacrifices during those forty years \add that you were\add* in the desert, you \add most certainly\add* were not offering them to me!\f + \ft Or: what makes you think that you were offering them to me? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 41 So they made an image that looked like a calf. Then they offered sacrifices to honor that idol, and they sang and danced because of what they themselves had made.
\v 42 So God stopped correcting them. He abandoned them to worship the sun, moon and stars in the sky. This agrees with the words that one of the prophets wrote: 
\q God said, 'You Israelite people, when you repeatedly killed animals and offered them as sacrifices during those forty years that you were in the wilderness, were you offering them to me?

\v 41 So they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced because of the work of their hands.

\q 'Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices
\q For forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
