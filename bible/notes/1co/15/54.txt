===== translationNotes: =====

  * **when this perishable body has put on what is imperishable** - Here the body is spoken of as if it were a person, and becoming imperishable is spoken of as if being imperishable was clothing that a body would wear. AT: "when this perishable body has become imperishable" or "when this body that can rot can no longer rot" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **when this mortal body has put on immortality** - Here the body is spoken of as if it were a person, and becoming immortal is spoken of as if being immortal was clothing that a body would wear. AT: "when this mortal body has become immortal" or "when this body that can die can no longer die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?** - Paul speaks as if death were a person, and he uses this question to mock the power of death, which Christ has defeated. AT: "Death has no victory. Death has no sting." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **your ... your** - These are singular. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
