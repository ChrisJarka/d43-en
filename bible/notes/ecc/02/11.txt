====== Ecclesiastes 02:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 But then I thought about all the hard work that I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* had done \add to get all those things\add*,
\q2 and none of it seems to bring any lasting benefit \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q1 It was all like chasing the wind.

\q1
\v 12 Then I started to think about being wise, and also about being foolish \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q2 \add I said to myself, "I certainly do not think that\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the next king will be able to do anything better than I can."

\v 11 But then I thought about all the hard work that I had done to obtain all those things.
\q2 I saw that none of my work brought me any lasting benefit.
\q1 It was all like trying to control the wind.

\q1
\v 12 Then I started to think about being wise, and also about being foolish.
\q2 I said to myself, "I certainly do not think that anybody will be able to do anything better than I can."

\q1
\v 11 Then I looked on all the deeds that my hands had accomplished,
\q2 and on the work that I had done,
\q1 but again, everything was vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.
\q2 There was no profit under the sun in it.
\q1
\v 12 Then I turned to consider wisdom,
\q2 and also madness and folly.
\q1 For what can the next king do who comes after the king,
\q2 which has not already been done?

===== translationNotes: ====

  * **all the deeds that my hands had accomplished** - Here the author refers to himself by his "hands." AT: "all that I had accomplished" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **vapor** - "mist" or "breath." This speaks of everything as if it were a vapor to emphasize that it does not last. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "temporary" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and an attempt to shepherd the wind** - The author speaks of everything that people do as being useless as if they were trying to control the wind. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12|1:14]]. AT: "and are as useless as trying to control the wind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **under the sun** - This refers to things that are done on earth. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:01|1:3]]. AT: "on the earth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **madness and folly** - The words "madness" and "folly" share similar meanings and refer to foolish thinking and behavior, respectively. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ecc:01:16|1:17]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **For what can the next king do ... which has not already been done?** - The writer uses this question to emphasize his point that the next king will not be able to do anything more valuable that what he had already done. AT: "For the next king can do nothing ... which has not already been done." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the next king ... who comes after the king** - "the king ... who succeeds the current king." This was probably written by the current king, so "after the king" could also be translated as "after me" (UDB).
