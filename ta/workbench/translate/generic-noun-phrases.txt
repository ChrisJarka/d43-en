Generic noun phrases refer to people or things in general rather than to specific individuals or things. 
  * **The __one who does what is right__ is kept away from trouble and it comes upon __the wicked__ instead.** (Proverbs 11:8) -  The underlined phrases do not refer to any specific people but to anyone who does what is right or anyone who is wicked.
