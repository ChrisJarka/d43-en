\v 42 And it is the same way \add with our bodies. The bodies that we will have when God causes us\add* to live again after we die \add will not be the same as the bodies that we have now\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add The bodies that we have now\add* will die and decay. \add The new bodies that we will have\add* will never die.
\v 43 We despise \add the bodies that we have now\add*, before we die. But our \add new bodies\add* will be glorious. The \add bodies that we have before we die\add* are weak. But our new bodies will be strong.
\v 44 The bodies that we have before we die are natural bodies. But \add our new bodies\add* will be ones that \add God's\add* Spirit \add controls\f + \ft Or: gives us\add* \f*. Just like there are natural bodies, there are bodies that \add God's\add* Spirit \add completely\add* controls \f + \ft Or: makes alive \f*.

\v 42 So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, and what is raised is imperishable.
\v 43 What is sown in dishonor is raised up in glory. What is sown in weakness is raised in power.
\v 44 What is sown a natural body is raised a spiritual body. So, there is both a natural body and there is a spiritual body, differing in kind.
