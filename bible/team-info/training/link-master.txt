====== Key Terms: Link and Page Master ======
**note:** This page and job description has been revised to current procedures (8Jan15).


===== Procedures =====

The Key Term Link and Page Master (LPM) will handle the hyperlink and page creation as necessary.
  * Creation of pages will normally be tagged as "create" following the template specified on this page. Example:
<code>
{{tag>create BBBNN}}
**  OR  **
{{tag>draft}}
where BBB = lowercase 3-letter Bible book designator\\
and NN = Chapter number
</code>
  * Each week "create" tagged key term pages will be promoted to "draft" as those kt pages are to support the Notes Teams efforts. Example:
<code>
{{tag>review}}
</code>
  * It is up to the KT team leader to promote pages through the process to "publish"
  * At "publish" stage, a check will be made to remove "ktlink" tag and create all x-ref hyperlinks. For Example:
<code>
  * [[en:bible:notes:key-terms:URLterm]]
</code>

==== Pagename naming conventions ====


The display name of the KT will default to the Key Term Header (title).

The link will use the URL name of the term. 
   See https://www.door43.org/en/bible/admin-reports/00-key-term-and-tag-names

The key term pagename naming convention is:
  * for a single word, the url-name is lower case.
  * for a multi-word phrase, the url-name is the words without spaces, hyphens, or other breaks (ex: kingdomofJudah).

==== Create KT Pages as Needed ====

When KT's on the Notes page are not found in the [[https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/key-terms/01-kt-list|https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/key-terms/01-kt-list]], new pages must be created. The URL name for the new KT page should in the following format:

<code>
https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/key-terms/urlname
</code>

For one-word KT's, the word will become the URL name. If the term is a multi-word phrase, the words will be run together without spaces, hyphens, or other breaks, as with existing terms.

There are two kinds of KT pagesâ€“one for terms that require definition, and the other for proper names that requires facts.

The draft code for a "term" KT page is:

<code>
====== term ======

===== Definition: =====

    * bullet

The draft code for a "Name" KT page is:

<code>
====== Name ======
