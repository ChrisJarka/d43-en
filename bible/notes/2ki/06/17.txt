\v 17 Then he prayed, "Yahweh, I request that you open my servant's eyes in order that he can see \add what is out there\add*!" So Yahweh enabled the servant to look out and see that surrounding the hill on which the town \add was built\add* was a huge number of horses and chariots made of fire!
\p
\v 18 When the army of Syria prepared to attack Elisha, he prayed again, saying, "Yahweh, cause all these soldiers to become blind!" Yahweh answered his prayer and caused them to be unable to see clearly.
\p
\v 19 Then Elisha went to them and said, "You are not on the right road; this is not the city that you are searching for. I will take you to the man whom you are searching for." But he led them to Samaria, \add the capital of Israel\add*!

\v 17 And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the
young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
\v 18 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to Jehovah, and said, Strike this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And
he struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
\v 19 And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom
you seek. And he led them to Samaria.
