\v 16 Under the sun he is green,
\q and his shoots go out over his entire garden.

\v 17 His roots are wrapped about the heaps of stone;
\q they look for good places among the rocks.

\v 18 But if this person is destroyed out of his place,
\q then that place will deny him and say, ‘I never saw you.’
