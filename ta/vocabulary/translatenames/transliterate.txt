===== Transliterate =====


To transliterate a word is basically to write it using the script and spelling system of another language. The words in the Bible that you will transliterate most are the proper names of people and places. You may also transliterate the common names of things that your language does not already have a word for. For example, if your language does not have a word for camel, then you might transliterate the word camel into your language.


There are several things to be aware of when transliterating words from one language into another.


    * <font 13px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff>Different languages use different scripts, such as the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Cyrillic,</font> Devenagari<font 13px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff>, and Korean scripts. These scripts use different shapes to represent the letters in their alphabets.</font> 
    * <font 13px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff>Languages that use the same script might pronounce the letters in that script differently. For example, w</font> <font 13px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff>hen speaking German, people pronounce the letter "j" the same way that people pronounce the letter "y" when speaking English.</font> 
    * Languages do not all have the same sounds or combinations of sounds. For example, many languages do not have the soft "th" sound in the English word "think."


There are several senses of the word transliterate.


    * <font 13px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff>One sense of "transliterate" is simply to write a word of one language by substituting each letter shape with the corresponding letter shape of the script of your language.</font> 
    * Another sense of "transliterate" is to modify the spelling to fit the spelling conventions of your language. For example if Greek uses "gg" to represent the "ng" sound you might change the spelling to "ng".
    * Another sense of "transliterate" is to adjust the spelling to fit the sound system of your language. For example a language that never ends a word with "d" might spell the name "David" as "Davit."
