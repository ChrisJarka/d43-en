\v 17 So Yahweh, now show that you are very powerful. You said,
\v 18 'I do not quickly become angry; instead, I love people greatly, and I forgive people for having sinned and having disobeyed my laws. But I will always punish \f + \ft litotes \f* people who are guilty of doing what is wrong. When parents sin, I will punish them, but I will also punish their children and their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren and their great-great-grandchildren.'
\v 19 So, because you love people like that, forgive these people for the sins that they have committed, just like you have continued to forgive them ever since they left Egypt."

\v 17 Now, I pray to you, let the power of Yahweh be great. Just as you have explained, say,
\v 18 'Yahweh is slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness. He forgives iniquity and transgression. He will by no means clear the guilty when he visits the iniquity of the fathers upon their descendants, to the third and to the fourth generation.'
\v 19 Pardon, I ask you, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your covenant loyalty, just as you have forgiven this people from Egypt even until now."
