\v 21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
\v 22 But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, I will not go
up until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.
\v 23 And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems you good; wait until you have weaned him; only Jehovah
establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.
