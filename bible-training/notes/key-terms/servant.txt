===== Definition: =====


A servant is a person who works for another person, either by choice or by force.


    * Some servants are an important part of their master's household and are treated almost like members of the family. In the Old Testament a person could choose to become a lifetime servant to his or her master.
    * A slave is a kind of servant who is the property of the person he works for. Just as people buy clothing and animals, in some parts of the world, people buy people. The person who buys a slave is called his "owner" or "master." Some masters treat their slaves very cruelly while other masters treat their slaves very well.
    * In biblical times, some people willingly put themselves into a form of slavery for the purpose of paying back debts.
    * People who follow God are often called His "servants."
