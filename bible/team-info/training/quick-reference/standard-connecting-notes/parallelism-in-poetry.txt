====== Parallelism in Poetry ======

===== Description =====

When working with poetic and prophetic material, we would not want to write a note that explains every use of parallelism. Instead we can have a note at the beginning of a passage that has a lot of parallelism, and at the beginning of a chapter where the parallelism continues from a previous chapter.

When writing the notes, replace "[The author]" with the name of the author or speaker, and replace [c:v] with the chapter and verse where it began. \\


===== Standard Notes =====

[The author] uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: Parallelism)

[The author] continues poetry that began in [c:v]. (See: Parallelism)
