===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.

 === Matthew 23:24 === 
You blind guides, you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!

  * **but swallow a camel** - (3) This is a an exaggeration. A camel cannot fall into a person's drink, and a person cannot swallow a camel. Its purpose is to show that the religious leaders were doing something extremely foolish. (See: Hyperbole)

=== Luke 14:26 === 

If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters--yes, and his own life also--he cannot be my disciple.

  * **(1) does not hate his own father** - (3) This is an exaggeration to show how important it is to love Jesus much more than anyone else. **(4)** If it would be misunderstood, it can be translated as "does not love me much more than he loves his father" **(5)** (See: Hyperbole).


=== 2 Thessalonians 1:11 ===

For this we also pray continually for you, that our God will consider you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness

  * **(1) we also pray continually for you**  - **(3)**  This is an exaggeration. It means that when Paul and his friends prayed, they also prayed for the Thessalonians. Paul wanted the Thessalonians to know how much he cared about them. **(4)**  Alternate translation: "we also pray frequently for you." **(5)**  (See: Hyperbole)
=== Acts 7:22 ===

"Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works."

  * **(1) all the learning of the Egyptians**  - **(3)**  This is an exaggeration for Moses learning many things. **(4)**  Alternate translation: "many things that the Egyptians knew." **(5)**  (See: Hyperbole)

=== Titus 1:12 ===

One of them, a wise man of theirs, said, "Cretans are unceasing liars, bad and dangerous animals, lazy bellies."

  * **(1) Cretans are unceasing liars**  - **(3)**  This is an exaggeration. Paul wanted Titus to know how important it was that he stop people from lying. **(4)**  Alternate translation: "Cretans often lie" or "Cretans regularly lie." **(5)**  (See: Hyperbole)
