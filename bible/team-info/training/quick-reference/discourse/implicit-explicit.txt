 ====== Implicit and Explicit Information ======

===== Description =====

There are two different forms of communication found in both written and spoken messages. One is called **//explicit//** and the other //**implicit**//. The speaker, or writer, has a particular audience in mind as he gives the message. This affects the form of his message and his decision on what information to include or leave out.
   * A message with all information included is **explicit**,
  * A message that leaves out information but is still understood is **implicit**.
