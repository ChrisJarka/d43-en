===== Issues that Come Up When Reviewing Notes ====

  * A note might be a Bible study commentary rather than a translation issue.
  * A note might have complicated language that would be hard for some of our audience.
  * A note might not be worded structured and formatted according to [[en:bible:team-info:processes:create-note]]
  * A note might be written as if it is the first time the phrase has occurred when we could explain it a little and say ‚ÄùSee how you translated this in 8:19."
  * There may be other issues that need translation notes.
  * Team members may have differing views about how to handle something.
  * Team members may request changes to the UDB or ULB. I discuss these with the editor for those texts.
  * There is a need to revise notes to fit with the revisions to the UDB or ULB.

  * Add the links to the Translation Academy pages that are referred to in the notes.
