\v 47 The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is of heaven.
\v 48 Just as the one is made of dust, so also are the others made of dust. And just as the one is heavenly,  so also are those that are heavenly.
\v 49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
