\v 11 Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil
abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
\v 12 He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remains and is
besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath upon them.
