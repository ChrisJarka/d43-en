\q
\v 10 For I have heard many frightening rumors from all around! ‘Report! So we must report it!’ 
\q Every man at peace with me, who guard me when I stumble; perhaps will be persuaded 
\q So we will prevail against him and have vengeance on him.
\q
\v 11 But Yahweh is with me like a powerful warrior, therefore the one pursuing me will stagger; 
\q And they will not be prevail! They will be greatly ashamed for they will not prosper: 
\q A perpetual reproach that will not be forgotten!
