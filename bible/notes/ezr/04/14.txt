\v 14 Surely because we have eaten the salt of the palace, it is not fitting for us to see the dishonor of the king. Because of this we are sending out to inform the king
\v 15 so he may search in the letter of the record of your father, and discover in the letter of record and know that this is a rebellious city that will harm kings and provinces. They will go 
across the interior like the old days of this city until this city was made into a wasteland.
\v 16 We are informing the king that if this city is built and the wall built, then there will be no possession beyond the river.‚Äù
