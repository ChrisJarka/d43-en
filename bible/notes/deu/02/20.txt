\v 20 That region is also called the land of the Repha giants, who formerly lived there. The Ammon people-group call them the Zamzum group.
\v 21 They were a large and powerful group, who were as tall as the descendants of Anak. But Yahweh got rid of them, and the Ammon people-group expelled them and took their land away from them and started to live there.
\v 22 Yahweh had done the same thing for the descendants of Esau who live in the hilly area of Edom. He got rid of the Hor people-group, with the result that the Edom people-group took their land from them and started to live there. They still live there.

\v 20 (That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim lived therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
\v 21 a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Jehovah destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their stead;
\v 22 as he did for the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their stead even to this day.
