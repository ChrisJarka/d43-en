\v 12 While I was with them, I kept them in your name which you have given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them
perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
\v 13 But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
\v 14 I have given them your word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
