\v 14 Tomorrow morning you must present yourselves before Yahweh, tribe by tribe. Then Yahweh will indicate to which tribe \add the man who took those things belongs\add*. Then Yahweh will indicate to which clan from that tribe \add the guilty man belongs\add*. Then Yahweh will indicate to which family he belongs. And then he will indicate which person \add in that family took them\add*.
\v 15 Then the one who has taken some of the things that should have been destroyed will be destroyed in a fire. And everything he owns will be destroyed with him, because he has disobeyed the command that Yahweh gave us and has done something that is disgraceful to us Israelite people.'~"

\v 14 In the morning, you will present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that Yahweh identifies will present themselves family by family. The family that Yahweh identifies will present themselves household by household. The household that Yahweh identifies will present themselves man by man.
\v 15 It will be that the man identified with the devoted things will be burned with fire. He and all that he has will be burned because he has broken the covenant of Yahweh and because he has done an outrageous thing in Israel."
