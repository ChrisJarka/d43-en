\v 16 Then I spoke to the priests and the other people, and I said, "This is what Yahweh says: 'Do not believe your prophets who tell you that all the gold items \add that were taken\add* from my temple \add by soldiers from Babylon\add* will soon be returned from Babylon, because what they are prophesying is a lie.
\v 17 Do not pay attention to what they say. Surrender to the king of Babylon. If you do that, you will remain alive. \add If you do not do that\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, this entire city will be destroyed.
\v 18 If they are really prophets who speak messages from me, tell them to plead to me, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, that \add the soldiers from Babylon\add* will not be allowed to take away to Babylon the valuable items that still remain in the temple and in the king's palace and in \add the other palaces in\add* Jerusalem.

\v 16 I proclaimed this to the priests and all the people and said, "Yahweh says this: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you and say, 'Look! The objects belonging to Yahweh's house are being returned from Babylon now!' They are prophesying lies to you.
\v 17 Do not listen to them. You should serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a ruin?
\v 18 If they are prophets, and if the word of Yahweh has truly come to them, let them beg Yahweh of hosts not to send to Babylon the objects that remain in his house, the house of the king of Judah, and Jerusalem.

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah continues to speak the words of Yahweh.

  * **The objects belonging to Yahweh's house are being returned from Babylon now!** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "People are bringing back all the gold items that they took from Yahweh's temple!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

  * **If they are prophets, and if the word of Yahweh has truly come to them, let them beg** - This is a hypothetical situation that Jeremiah knows is not true. AT: "If they were prophets, and if the word of Yahweh had truly come to them, they would beg" or "Because they are not prophets and the word of Yahweh has not truly come to them, they will not beg" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **if the word of Yahweh has truly come to them** - The phrase "word of Yahweh" refers to messages from God. AT: "if Yahweh has truly given them messages" or "If Yahweh truly spoke messages to them"
