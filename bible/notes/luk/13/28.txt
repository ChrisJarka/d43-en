\v 28 There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast out.
\v 29 And they shall come from the east and west, and from the north and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.
\v 30 And behold, there are those last who shall be first, and there are those first who shall be last.
