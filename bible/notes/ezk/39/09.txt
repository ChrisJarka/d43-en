====== Ezekiel 39:9-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 At that time, those Israelites who live in the towns will go out and gather the weapons \add from the dead soldiers\add*, and use them to make fires to cook their food. They will burn the small and large shields, the bows and arrows, the war clubs, and spears. There will be enough weapons to use as firewood for seven years.
\v 10 They will not need to gather firewood in the fields or cut wood from trees in the forests, because those weapons will be all the firewood \add that they will need\add*. And they will take valuable things from those who took valuable things from them, and steal things from people who stole things from them. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare will happen.

\v 9 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the
shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven
years;
\v 10 so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of
the weapons; and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and rob those that robbed them, says the Lord Jehovah.
