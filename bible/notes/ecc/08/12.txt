\v 12 But even if sinful people commit a hundred crimes, and even if they live for a long time, I know that things will go better for those who honor and revere God.
\v 13 I also know that things will not go well go for those who are evil, because they do not honor God. Shadows do not last a long time. Similarly, evil people will not live a long time.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Even though a sinner does evil a hundred times and still lives a long time, yet I know that it will be better for those who respect God, for those who stand before him and show him respect.
\v 13 But it will not go well for a wicked man; his life will not be prolonged. His days are like a fleeting shadow because he does not honor God.
