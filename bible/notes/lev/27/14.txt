\v 14 \add Similarly\add*, if someone dedicates his house to be a sacred gift to belong to me, the priest will decide how much it is worth, which will depend on whether the house is in good condition. Whatever the priest says that it is worth, that will be its value \add and that is the price that the priest must pay for it\add*.
\v 15 If the man who dedicated his house to me later wants to buy it back, he must pay that price plus an added one-fifth, and then the house will belong to him again.

\v 14 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to Jehovah, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
\v 15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be his.
