\c 19
\p
\v 1 Moreover, take you up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
\v 2 and say, What was your mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her
whelps.
\v 3 And she brought up one of her whelps: he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.
\v 4 The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
