\p 
\v 1 Then Jesus left the Jordan River,  and the Holy Spirit was completely controlling him. 
\v 2 For forty days the Spirit led him around in the wilderness and the devil kept tempting him. During that timeJesus did not eat anything, so when the forty days were over, he was very hungry. 

\s5
\v 3 One day the devil said to Jesus, " If you really are the Son of God, prove it by commanding these stones to become bread for you to eat!" 
\v 4 Jesus replied, " No, I will not do that, because it is written in the Scriptures, “People don’t only need food to nourish their physical bodies, but they also need God’s teachings to nourish their spirits.” 

\s5
\v 5 Then the devil took Jesus up to the  top of a high mountain and showed him in an instant all the nations in the world. 
\v 6 Then he said to Jesus, "I will give you the authority to rule all  these nations and you will possess all their splendor and wealth.  I can do this because God has permitted me to control these nations , and so I can do whatever I want with them.! 
\v 7 So if you worship me, I will let you rule them all!"

\s5
\v 8 But Jesus replied, " No, I will not worship you, because it is written in the Scriptures, 'You must only worship the Lord, your God. He is the only one you may serve!'"

\s5
\p 
\v 9 Then the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem. He set him on the highest part of the Temple and said to him, " If you really are the Son of God, prove it by jumping down from here. 
\v 10 You will not be hurt, because it is written in the Scriptures, 'God will command his angels to protect you.’ 
\v 11 and it also says, ‘They will lift you up in their hands when you are falling, so that you will not get hurt. You will not even strike your foot on a stone.'”

\s5
\v 12 But Jesus replied, "No, I will not do that, because it is written in the Scriptures: 'Do not try to test the Lord your God'." 
\p 
\v 13 Then, after the devil had finished trying to tempt Jesus in many ways, he left him until some later time. 

\s5
\p 
\v 14 After this, Jesus left the wilderness9 and returned to the region of Galilee  and the Holy Spirit was empowering him. Throughout that region, people heard about Jesus and told others about him. 
\v 15 He taught people in their synagogues and they all spoke highly of him because of his teaching . 
 
\s5
\p 
\v 16 Then Jesus went to Nazareth, the town where he grew up. On the Sabbath he went to the synagogue, as he usually did. He stood up  to read aloud something from the Scriptures. 
\v 17 A synagogue attendant handed him a scroll containing the words that the prophet Isaiah had written long ago.  Jesus unrolled the scroll and found the place where these words were written:

\s5
\v 18 “The Spirit of the Lord is in me.
He has appointed me to declare God's good news to lowly people.
He has sent me here to proclaim that God will free people who are captives (to sin) and  will cause those who are blind to be able to see again. 
He will free people who have been oppressed.
\v 19 He sent me here to declare that now is the time when the Lord will act favorably toward people.

\s5
\p 
\v 20 Then he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. Everyone in the synagogue was looking intently at him. 
\v 21 He said to them, "Today this Scripture passage was fulfilled as you heard it. " 
\v 22 Everyone there heard what he said and spoke well of him, and they were amazed at how well he spoke. But some of them said, "This man is only Joseph's son, isn’t he? "

\s5
\v 23 He said to them, "Surely some of you will quote to me the proverb that says, 'Doctor, heal yourself!' , You will say, 'People told us that you did miracles in Capernaum town, but we do not know if those reports are true. Prove it to us by doing miracles here in your own hometown, too!'" 
\v 24 Then he said, "It is certainly true that people do not accept the message of a prophet when he speaks in his hometown .

\s5
\v 25 But think about this: There were many widows in Israel during the time when the prophet Elijah lived, when there was a great famine throughout the country  because there had been no rain for three and half years. 
\v 26 But God did not send Elijah to help any of those Jewish widows. God sent him to Zarepath town near Sidon city, to help a non-Jewish widow.
\v 27 There were also many Jewish lepers in Israel during the time when the prophet Elisha lived. But Elisha did not heal any of them. He healed only Naaman, a non-Jewish man from Syria." 

\s5
\v 28 When all the people in the synagogue heard him say that, they were very angry. 
\v 29 So they all got up and shoved him out of the town. They took him to the top of the hill outside their town in order to throw him off the cliff and kill him. 
\v 30 But he simply walked through their midst and went away.

\s5
\p 
\v 31 One day he went with his disciples down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee district. On the next Sabbath, he taught the people in the synagogue . 
\v 32 They were continually amazed at what he was teaching, because he spoke with authority. 

\s5
\v 33 That day, there was a man in the synagogue who was controlled by an evil spirit. The man shouted very loudly, 
\v 34 "Hey! Jesus, from Nazareth! We evil spirits have nothing to do with you,! Have you come to destroy us?  I know who you are. You are the Holy One from God!" 

\s5
\v 35 Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, saying, "Be quiet! And come out ofhim!" The demon threw the man down on the ground in the midst of the people and came out of him without harming him. 
\v 36 All the people in the synagogue were very amazed. They said to each other, "He speaks with such power and authority! Even evil spirits obey him and come out of people when he commands them to!" 
\v 37 And in every place throughout the surrounding regions, people kept talking about what Jesus had done.

\s5
\p 
\v 38 After Jesus had healed the man in the synagogue, he and his disciples left there and went to Simon’s house. Simon's mother-in-law was sick and had a high fever. Some people who were there asked Jesus to heal her. 
\v 39 So he bent over her and rebuked the fever. Immediately she became well! She got up and served them some food.

\s5
\p 
\v 40 When the sun was setting that day, many people brought to Jesus their friends or relatives who were sick  with various diseases . He put his hands on them and healed all of them. 
\v 41 He also was  forcing evil spirits to come out of many people. As the evil spirits  left those people, they shouted to Jesus, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked those evil spirits and would not allow them to tell people about him, because they knew that he was the Messiah, and he did not want everyone to know that yet.

\s5
\p 
\v 42 Early the next morning Jesus left that house and went to an uninhabited place to pray. Crowds of  people were searching for him, and when they found him they kept urging him not to leave them. 
\v 43 But he said to them, "I must tell people in other towns also the good message about how God wants to rule their lives, because that is what I was sent  to do." 
\v 44 So he kept preaching in the synagogues in various towns in the province of Judea.
