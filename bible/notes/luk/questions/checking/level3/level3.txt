====== Level 3 Checking (Recognized Organization) ======

Level 3 checking will be done by a recognized group or organization in order to verify that they approve of the distribution and use of the translation among the people affiliated with them. This approval is not required for distribution of the translation, but rather serves to validate it.

The topics to be covered in this check include:

  * Do the translators have sufficient understanding of the target language and culture and the source language to be able to translate the book?
  * Does the audience find the translation to be clear, accurate, and natural?
  * Was the book translated with the faithful use of the notes?
  * Is the book translated in a style and level that is appropriate for the audience?
  * Does the translation handle difficult passages well? 
  * Are there any doctrinal errors in the translation?

Each of these topics will be described in more detail.
