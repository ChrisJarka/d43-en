\v 7 We know for certain that it is the more \add important people\add* who \add ask God to\add* bless the less important people. \add And Melchizedek blessed Abraham. So we conclude that Melchizedek was greater than Abraham\add*.
\v 8 In the case of \add the priests who are descendants of Levi\add*, men who some day will die receive tithes. But in the case of \add Melchizedek it is as if God\add* testifies that he was still living, \add since there is no record in Scriptures about his death\add*.
\v 9 And it was as though Levi himself, and \add all the priests descended from him\add*—who received tithes \add from the people\add*—paid tithes \add to Melchizedek\add*. And when Abraham paid tithes, it \add was as though Levi and all the priests descended from him acknowledged that the work Melchizedek did as a priest was greater than the work Levi did\add*,
\v 10 since \add the sperm from which all those priests were eventually born\add* was still in Abraham's body \f + \ft euphemism \f* when Melchizedek met Abraham.

\v 7 Everyone knows that the more important people bless the less important people, and Melchizedek blessed Abraham. So Melchizedek was greater than Abraham.
\v 8 In the case of the priests who are descendants of Levi, men who some day will die received tithes. But in the case of Melchizedek it is as if God testifies that he keeps living, since there is no record about his death.
\v 9 And it was as though Levi himself, and all the priests descended from him—who received tithes from the people—paid tithes to Melchizedek because their ancestor Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek. When Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek it was as though Levi and all the priests descended from Levi acknowledged that Melchizedek was greater Levi,
\v 10 since the sperm (or life?) from which Levi and his priestly descendents were eventually born was still in Abraham's body when Melchizedek met Abraham.

\v 7 There is no denial that the lesser person is blessed by the greater person.
\v 8 And in this case men who must die receive tithes, but in the other  case the one who receives tithes is described as living on.
\v 9 And, in a manner of speaking, Levi who received tithes also paid tithes through Abraham 
\v 10 because Levi was in the body of his ancestor Abraham when Melchizedek met Abraham.
