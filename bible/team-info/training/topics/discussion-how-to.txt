<font 14px line-height: normal;/Helvetica;;rgb(0, 0, 0) font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;;;inherit>1) Create a new discussion  when you want to discuss a topic or issue that has not been brought up yet in the Discussion section.  You do this by writing in the edit pane at the bottom of the discussion section. When you have finished, click on the <Save> button at the bottom. This will put your Discussion at the top of the Discussion section.</font> \\

<font 14px line-height: normal;/Helvetica;;rgb(0, 0, 0) font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;;;inherit>2) When you want to comment on what someone else has written in the Discussion section, click on the <Reply> button below their discussion. An edit box will come up for you to write it. When you are done writing in it, click on the <Save> button. This will put your comment below the one you are replying to. It will be indented. If other people have already replied to that person,  your comment will come below theirs.</font> \\

Other people will only see <Reply>.</font> <font 14px line-height: normal;/Helvetica;;rgb(0, 0, 0) font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;;;inherit>Only you can edit or delete your message. Other people can only reply to your message. The <Hide> button doesn’t seem to have any use. It seems to be like <Delete>.</font> \\

<font 14px line-height: normal;/Helvetica;;rgb(0, 0, 0) font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;;;inherit>If you want to edit or delete your message, only do so if no one has replied to your message. If others have replied to your message you can reply to your own message by clicking on the <Reply> button in your message or by clicking the  <Reply> button in someone else’s reply.</font>
