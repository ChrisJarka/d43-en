===== TRANSLATION NOTES:=====

  * **You have multiplied the nation, you have increased their joy** - "You" refers to Yahweh, "nation" refers to the Israel, and "their" refers to the people of Israel. Alternate translation: "Lord, you have greatly increased the people of Israel and their joy."  Notice that the ULB uses "they" and "their," but the UDB uses "us" and "we" because Isaiah sees himself as belonging to the people of Israel. See ([[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:inclusive]]). Notice also that the ULB uses past tense, but the UDB uses future tense.  Often in prophecy, things that will happen in the future are described as happening in the past.  This emphasizes that these things will certainly happen. 
  * **they rejoice before you like the joy at harvest time, as men rejoice when they divide the plunder** -  Alternate translation: "They rejoice like people at harvest time or like soldiers dividing things captured in battle." (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:simile]])
