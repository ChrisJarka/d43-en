<usfm>
\v 2 And many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of
Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of
Jehovah from Jerusalem;
\v 3 and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their
swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they
learn war any more.
