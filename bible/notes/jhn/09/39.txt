\v 39 Jesus said, "I have come into this world to judge \add the people in the world\add*. The result will be that \add those who realize that they do not know God's truth will perceive it. That is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add enabling\add* those who are blind to see. But the result will also be that people who \add falsely think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* that \add they understand God's truth will never understand it. That is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add people\add* who are blind remaining blind permanently."
\v 40 Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard him say that, and said to him, "You are not suggesting that we are \add like\add* blind people, are you?"
\v 41 Jesus said to them, "If you \add realized that you did not yet know God's truth, but you wanted to, then you would be like\add* blind people \add who wanted to see. God would be able to\add* forgive your sins. But you are now \add falsely\add* claiming that you \add know God's truth, so you are like people who are blind who claim that they\add* can see. \add Because of that, God is not able to\add* forgive your sins."

\v 40 Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard him say this; they said to him, "Are we also blind?"
\v 41 Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no guilt. But because you now defend yourself and say, 'We see,' your guilt is staying with you.
