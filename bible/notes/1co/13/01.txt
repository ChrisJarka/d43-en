\c 13
\p
\v 1 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.
\v 2 And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
\v 3 And if I give all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profist me nothing.
