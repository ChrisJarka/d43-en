\q2 I will cry about all its people that they might receive help to survive.
\q2 I will moan for the men of Kir Hareseth city, the old capital of Moab.
\q1
\v 32 You people of Sibmah city, you have many vineyards, and I will be sad when they are destroyed.
\q2 It is as though the branches of your vines extend across the Dead Sea to Jazer city, but the enemies of Moab will take your grapes and wine from you!

<usfm>
\v 30 I myself know his outbursts and they are not reliable.—this is Yahweh’s declaration—His boasting does not make it so.
\q 
\v 31 Therefore I will howl with lament for Moab, and I will cry for help for all of Moab
\q He moans for the men of Kir Heresh.
\q
\v 32 I will weep for you more than the weeping for Jazer, vine of Sibmah! Your twigs crossed from the sea 
\q to the sea of Jazer. They touched your summer fruit, but the destroyer has fallen upon your vintage
