\p As in all the churches of the saints,
\v 34 the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but they should be in submission, as also the Law says.
\v 35 And if there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
\v 36 Did the word of God come from you, or are you the only ones it has reached?
