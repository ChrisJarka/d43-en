Some images from the body involving body parts and human qualities are listed below in alphabetical order. The word in all capital letters represents the image. The word does not necessarily appear in every verse that has the image, but the idea that the word represents does.

Below each example from the Bible is an alternate translation that either gives the meaning without the image or shows how the image gives the meaning. 

=== The idea of BODY represents a group of people ===
  * **Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.** (1 Corinthians 12:27 ULB)

    * "Christ joins the whole community of believers together—it is held together by every member so that the whole community grows and builds itself up in love."
