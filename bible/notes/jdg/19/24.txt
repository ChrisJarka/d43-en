\v 24 See, here are my daughter, who is a virgin, and here is his concubine; I will bring out now, and you can humiliate them and do to them whatever seems good to you; but do not do any such wicked thing to this man.”
\v 25 But the men would not listen to him; so the Levite seized his concubine and brought her out to them. They raped her and abused her all night long until morning. When the day began to dawn, they let her go.
\v 26 Then at dawn the woman came and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her master was; she lay there until it was light.
