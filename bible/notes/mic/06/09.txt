<usfm>
\q
\v 9 The voice of Yahweh is making a proclamation to the cityâ€”
\q even now wisdom acknowledges your name:
\q "Pay attention to the rod,
\q and to the one who has put it in place.
\f + \ft Instead of the Hebrew text's reading of \fqa Pay attention to the rod and to the one who has put it into place \fqa* , some modern versions have \fqa Listen, tribe, and those assembled together in the city \fqa* . \f*
\q
\v 10 There is wealth in the houses of the wicked that is dishonest,
\q and false measures that are abominable.

  * **even now wisdom acknowledges your name** - Wisdom is spoken of as a person and is a metonym for the wise person. The word "name" here is a metonym for the person himself, what people think of him, and his authority. AT: "and the wise person will fear you" or "and the wise person will acknowledge that you are good and will obey you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])

  * **There is wealth in the houses of the wicked that is dishonest** - Dishonest wealth is a metonym for wealth that people have gained by acting dishonestly. The words "the wicked" refer to wicked people. Houses are a synecdoche for everything a person possesses.
