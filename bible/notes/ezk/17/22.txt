\v 22 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: So I myself will take away the highest point of the cedar, and place it away from its tender branches. I will break it off and I myself will plant it on a high and exalted mountain!
\v 23 I will plant it on the mountain peak of Israel so it will bear up branches and produce fruit, and it will become a majestic cedar until every winged bird will dwell under, they will nest it in the shade of its branches.
