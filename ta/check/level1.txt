===== Checking Level 1 â€“ Internal Check =====

==== Definition of Checking Level 1 ====

<font 14px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Level One checking will be done primarily by the translation team, with some help from others in the language community. The translator or translation team should check their translation before they translate very many stories or chapters of the Bible, so that they can correct mistakes as early as possible in the translation process. Many of the steps in this process will need to be done several times before the translation is finished.</font>

  * For the purposes of the unfoldingWord project, translations of Bible texts are only published once they achieve Level 2. Other biblical content is made available at Level 1.
  * This enables the broadest reach of the content as an active project, with an open invitation (implied or direct) to help improve the translation.
