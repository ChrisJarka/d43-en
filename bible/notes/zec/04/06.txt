\v 6 Then the angel said to me, "This is the message from Yahweh to you, Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah: 'You will do what I want you to do, but it will not be by your own strength or power. It will be done by the power of my Spirit,' says Yahweh, commander of the angel armies."
\v 7 The angel continued to speak to me: "Zerubbabel, you have many difficult matters to handle. They are like high mountains. But it will be as though they became flat land. And you will bring to the new temple the final stone, the highest stone, to complete it. When you set it in place, all the people will shout repeatedly, 'It is beautiful! May God bless it!'"

\v 6 So he said to me, "This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel: Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, says Yahweh of hosts.
\v 7 What are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain, and he will bring out the top stone to shouts of 'Grace! Grace to it!'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - The angel who speaks with Zechariah continues to explain the vision.

  * **Not by might nor by power** - Since there is no verb in this phrase, it may be necessary in your language to supply one. AT: "You will not succeed by might nor by power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Not by might nor by power** - Possible meanings are 1) that the words "might" and "power" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the greatness of Zerubbabel's strength or 2) that the word "might" refers to military strength and the word "power" refers to Zerubbabel's physical ability. AT: "Certainly not by your own strength" or "Not by military strength nor by your own power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **What are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain** - This is a metaphor in which Yahweh speaks of the obstacles that Zerubbabel will face as if they were a large mountain. He asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that these obstacles pose no threat to Zerubbabel's success. The question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You are nothing, great mountain! Zerubbabel will cause you to become a plain" or "Although obstacles may appear as large as mountains, Zerubbabel will overcome them as easily as one walks upon level ground" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **he will bring out the top stone** - The top stone is the last stone placed when building something. This refers to the top stone of the temple. AT: "he will bring out the top stone of the temple" or "he will complete the construction of the temple" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **to shouts of 'Grace! Grace to it!'** - Possible meanings are 1) the word "grace" refers to God's grace and the people are requesting that God bless the completed temple. AT: "while people shout, 'May God bless it! May God bless it!'" or 2) the word "grace" refers to beauty and the people are declaring how beautiful the completed temple is. AT: "while people shout, 'Beautiful! It is beautiful!'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
