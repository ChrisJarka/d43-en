\v 28 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:
\v 29 and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me
to be there: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren.
Therefore he is not come to the kingâ€™s table.
