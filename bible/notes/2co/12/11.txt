====== 2 Corinthians 12:11-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 It has been foolish for me \add to talk about myself like this\add*, but it is you who forced me to do it. Truly \add if the Lord would not help me\add*, I would be worthless, \add as my opponents say that I am\add*. But none of the men whom you \add wrongfully think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* are great apostles are greater in any way than I am. So it would have been right\f + \ft Or: proper \f* for you to say good things about me.
\v 12 \add You should have done that, because\add* when I was with you \add I\add* repeatedly did the things that showed you that \add I am truly\add* an apostle, such as performing many \f + \ft doublet \f* miracles.
\v 13 And I have \add certainly treated\add* you as well as \add I treated\add* the other congregations \add that I helped to start. Or do you think that\add* by not asking you \add to pay me for my work\add*, I was not treating you as well as I treated the other congregations? It is foolish for you to\add think that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add it\add* was wrong for me not \add to ask for pay from you for my work, and therefore I should ask\add* you to forgive me for that!\f + \ft Or: Do you \add think that it\add* was wrong for me not \add to ask for pay from you for my work, and therefore I should ask\add* you to forgive me for that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 11 I am a fool. You forced me to be. For I should have been commended by you: for I was not at all inferior to the super apostles, even though I am nothing.
\v 12 The true signs of an apostle were performed among you with a lot of patience--signs and wonders and mighty works.
\v 13 For how was it that you were inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong.
