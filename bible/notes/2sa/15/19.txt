\v 19 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore go you also with us? return, and abide with the king: for you are
a foreigner, and also an exile; return to your own place.
\v 20 Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return
thou, and take back your brethren; mercy and truth be with thee.
