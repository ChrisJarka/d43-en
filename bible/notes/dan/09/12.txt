\v 12 You warned us and our rulers that you would punish Jerusalem severely by causing a great disaster there, a disaster that would be worse than any disaster that any other city had ever experienced, and you have done what you said that you would do.
\v 13 You punished us just like Moses wrote that you would do. But Yahweh our God, we still have not tried, by turning away from our sinning and by heeding your truth, to persuade you to act mercifully toward us.
\v 14 So, because we did not obey you, you prepared to punish us, and then you did punish us, because you always do what is righteous\f + \ft Or: just \f*\f + \ft Or: fair \f*.

\v 12 And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a
great evil; for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done upon Jerusalem.
\v 13 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet have we not entreated the favor of Jehovah our
God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in your truth.
\v 14 Therefore has Jehovah watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works
which he doeth, and we have not obeyed his voice.
