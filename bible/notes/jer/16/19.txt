\v 19 O Jehovah, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, to you shall the nations come from
the ends of the earth, and shall say, Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies,
even vanity and things wherein there is no profit.
\v 20 Shall a man make to himself gods, which yet are no gods?
\v 21 Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall
know that my name is Jehovah.
