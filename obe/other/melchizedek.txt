====== Melchizedek ======

â€‹

===== Facts: =====

During the time when Abram lived, Melchizedek was the king of Salem, a city that would later be called "Jerusalem". He was also called a "priest of God Most High."

  * Melchizedek's name means, "king of righteousness" and his title "king of Salem" means "king of peace."
  * After Abram's victory over an alliance of powerful kings, Melchizedek blessed Abram and served him bread and wine.
  * Abram gave Melchizedek one-tenth of the plunder from his victory.
  * In the New Testament, Melchizedek is described as someone who had no father or mother. He was a priest and king who will reign forever. He is said to "resemble the Son of God."
  * Also in the New Testament, Jesus is called a priest who serves according to the priestly "order of Melchizedek." This was different from the Jewish priests who were from the order of Levi. Jesus is our "Great High Priest" whose priesthood comes directly from God, not from human descent.
  * These statements may indicate that Melchizedek was a representative or actual appearance of the Son of God before he came to earth as a human being.
