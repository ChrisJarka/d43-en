====== pure, purify, purification ======

===== Definition: =====

To be "pure" means to have no flaw or to have nothing mixed in that is not supposed to be there. To purify something is to cleanse it and remove anything that contaminates or pollutes it.

  * In regard to Old Testament laws, "purify"and "purification" refer mainly to the cleansing from things that make an object or a person ritually unclean, such as disease, body fluids, or childbirth.
  * The Old Testament also had laws telling people how to be purified from sin, usually by the sacrifice of an animal. This was only temporary and the sacrifices had to be repeated over and over again.
  * In the New Testament, to be purified often refers to being cleansed from sin. The only way that people can be completely and permanently purified from sin is through repenting and receiving God's forgiveness, through trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice.
  * The term "purify" could be translated as "cleanse from all contamination" or "get rid of all sin."
