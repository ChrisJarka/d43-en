====== wisdom ======


===== Definition: =====


Wisdom is the knowledge and good judgment that people learn from what they have experienced in life. The Bible speaks about both worldly wisdom and godly wisdom. Godly wisdom is truly wise and righteous.


    * A person gets godly wisdom by listening to God, submitting to his will and humbly obeying him.
    * Wisdom helps a person be safe, successful and helpful to other people.
    * A wise person will show the fruits of the Holy Spirit in his life, such as joy, kindness, love and patience.


The opposite of wisdom is foolishness or rebellion against God.
