\v 10 Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at
your hand.
\v 11 For from the rising of the sun even to it's setting my name
shall be great among the nations; and in every place incense
shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name
shall be great among the nations, says Yahweh of hosts.
\v 12 But you are profaning it when you say  the Lord's table is polluted, and its fruit, its food, is despised.
