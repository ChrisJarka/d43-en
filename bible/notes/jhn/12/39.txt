<usfm>
\v 39 That was the reason why they were unable to believe. \add It was like\add* Isaiah wrote somewhere else that God said:
\q
\v 40 They have \add refused to understand; they acted as though they were\add* blind people!
\q They were insensible in their inner beings!
\q As a result, they have not perceived \add my truth\add*!
\q1 They have not understood it in their inner beings!
\q1 They have not turned \add from their sinful lives\add*,
\q2 and because of that I cannot help them!

\v 39 Therefore they could not give him their trust. For Isaiah wrote: :
\q
\v 40 
\q"The Lord has made them so they cannot see, 
\q1 he has made their hearts hard --
\q even their eyes cannot see, 
\q1 and their hearts cannot understand, 
\q and they have not turned to me in repentance, 
\q1 and because of that I cannot heal them!"

<usfm>
\v 39 For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,
\q
\v 40 He has blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart;
\q Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart,
\q And should turn,
\q And I should heal them.
