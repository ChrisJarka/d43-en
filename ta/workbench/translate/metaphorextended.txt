==== Description ====

An extended metaphor is one that is used in more than a sentence. It might be used in a paragraph or in several lines of poetry. 

 
=== Reasons this is a translation issue  ===
  * People may not realize that the images represent other things.
  * People may not be familiar with the things that are used as images. 

=== Translation Principles  ===
  * Make the meaning of a metaphor as clear to the target audience as it was to the original audience.
  * Do not make the meaning of a metaphor more clear to the target audience than it was to the original audience.
  * When someone uses an extended metaphor, the images are an important part of what he is trying to say.
  * You may need to find some way of translating the images so that people can understand them.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the __clay__. You are our __potter__; and we all are the work of your hand. (Isaiah 64:8 ULB)

The example above has two metaphors. The topics are "we" and "you" and the images are "clay and "potter." Just as a potter takes clay and forms a jar or dish out of it, God makes us into what he wants us to be.

Psalm 23 has the extended metaphor of a shepherd representing God and sheep representing God's people. Shepherds give sheep what they need, take them to safe places, rescue them, guide them, and protect them. These are things that God does for his people.

>Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing.
>He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
>he leads me beside tranquil water.
>He brings back my life;
>he guides me along right paths for his name's sake.
>Even though I walk through a valley of darkest shadow,
>I will not fear harm since you are with me;
>your rod and your staff comfort me. (Psalm 23:1-4



==== Translation Strategies ====
If people would understand the metaphor in the same way that the original readers would have understood it, consider using it. If not, here are some other strategies.

  - If the target audience would think that the images should be understood literally, change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding "like" or "as."
  - If the target audience would not know the **image**, see [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] for ideas on how to translate that image.
  - If the target audience would not use that **image** for that meaning use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times.
