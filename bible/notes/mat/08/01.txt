===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins an account of Jesus miraculously healing several people.

  * **When Jesus had come down from the hill, large crowds followed him.**  - This can be translated as “After Jesus came down from the hill, a large crowd followed him.” The crowd may have included both people who had been with him on the mountain and people who had not been with him.
  * **Behold**  - The word “behold” alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses “There was a man who was…”
  * **a leper**  - “a man who had leprosy” or “a man who had a skin disease” (UDB)
  * **if you are willing**  - This can be translated “if you want to” or “if you desire”. The leper knew that Jesus had the power to heal him, but he did not know if Jesus would want to touch him.
  * **you can make me clean**  - This can be translated “you can heal me.” The man said this because he wanted Jesus to heal him. It can also be translated as a request: “please heal me” (UDB).
  * **immediately**  - “right away”
  * **he was cleansed of his leprosy**  - The result of Jesus saying “Be clean” was that the man was healed. It can be translated as “he was well” or “the leprosy left him” or “the leprosy ended.”
