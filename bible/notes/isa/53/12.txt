This means God will give the highest honor to the servant because of his sacrifice, and the servant will give honor to God's people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **because he poured out his soul to death** - AT: "he willingly died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **and was numbered with the transgressors** - AT: "and allowed people to think he was a sinner" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressions** - The word "intercession" means to do something on behalf of another. AT: "On behalf of all people, he bore their sins."
