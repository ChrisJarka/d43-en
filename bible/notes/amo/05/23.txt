===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Remove from me the noise of your songs**
  * **noise** - unpleasant sounds
  * **let justice flow like water, and righteousness like a constantly flowing stream** - This represents causing there to be much justice and righteous. AT: "let there be so much justice that it is like flowing water, and let there  be so much righteousness that it is like a constantly flowing stream" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **let justice flow like water** - The abstract noun "justice" can be expressed with the word "just." AT: "cause there to be much justice" or "cause the judges to always make just decisions" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and righteousness like a constantly flowing stream** - The words "let" and "flow" are understood from the previous phrase. AT: "and let righteousness flow like a constantly flowing stream" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **righteousness like a constantly flowing stream** - This speaks of justice as if it were a substance that there could be a lot of.
