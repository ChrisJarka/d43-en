\v 16 David looked up and saw the angel whom Yahweh had sent, standing between the sky and the ground. The angel had a sword in his hand that was pointed toward Jerusalem. Then David and the elders \add of the city\add*, who were wearing clothes made of rough sackcloth, prostrated themselves on the ground.

\v 17 David said to God, "I am \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the one who ordered the men who could be in the army to be counted. I am the one who has sinned and done what is very wrong, but these people are \add as innocent as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* sheep. They have certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* done anything \add that is wrong\add*. So Yahweh my God, punish [IDI] me and my family, but do not allow this plague to continue \add to cause\add* your people \add to become sick and die\add*."

\v 16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his
hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
\v 17 And David said to God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done
very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let your hand, I pray thee, OYahweh my God, be against me, and against my
fatherâ€™s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.
