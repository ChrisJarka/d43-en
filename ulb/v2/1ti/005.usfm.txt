\c 5
\p
\v 1 Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brethren:
\v 2 the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.
\v 3 Honor widows that are widows indeed.
\v 4 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to
requite their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
\v 5 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night
and day.
\v 6 But she that gives herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth.
\v 7 These things also command, that they may be without reproach.
\v 8 But if any provideth not for his own, and specially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an
unbeliever.
\v 9 Let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old,
having been the wife of one man,
\v 10 well reported of for good works; if she has brought up children, if she has used hospitality to strangers, if she has
washed the saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.
\v 11 But younger widows refuse: for when they have waxed wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;
\v 12 having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.
\v 13 And withal they learn also to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also
and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
\v 14 I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, give no occasion to the
adversary for reviling:
\v 15 for already some are turned aside after Satan.
\v 16 If any woman that believes has widows, let her relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it may relieve
them that are widows indeed.
\p
\v 17 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.
\v 18 For the scripture saith, You shall not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his
hire.
\v 19 Against an elder receive not an accusation, except at the mouth of
two or three witnesses.
\v 20 Them that sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.
\v 21 I charge you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that you observe these things
without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.
\v 22 Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep yourself pure.
\v 23 Be no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your often infirmities.
\v 24 Some men’s sins are evident, going before to judgment; and some men also they follow after.
\v 25 In like manner also there are good works that are evident; and such as are otherwise cannot be hid.
