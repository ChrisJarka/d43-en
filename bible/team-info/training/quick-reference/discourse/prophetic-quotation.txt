====== Prophetic Quotation ======

===== Description =====

Prophets often quoted what God said. Sometimes it is clear when a prophet was quoting God because the text says "The Lord says." But often there is no clear indication when God's speech ends. Also prophets often quoted God without marking it at all. There were no quotation marks in the original Hebrew text, and so English translations often put the quote marks in different places. Translators may follow the interpretations in the ULB, or UDB, or the interpretations of other translations that they have.


===== Notes for Beginning of Each Chapter =====

Prophets wrote God's messages to people. Sometimes they directly quoted God and sometimes they reported the information that God gave them. Sometimes it is not clear whether or not the prophet was directly quoting God.
