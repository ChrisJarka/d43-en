\v 9 Our Lord Jesus will drive them far from himself forever, far from his brilliant light where he rules with power.
\v 10 The Lord Jesus will do this when he comes back from heaven at the time that God has decided. As a result, all we who are his people will praise him marvel at him. And you will be there, too, because you believed what we solemnly told you.
