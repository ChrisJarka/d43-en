===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Then he said to them** - "Then Jesus said to his disciples." Since this is a continuation of Jesus speaking from the previous verse, some languages may prefer not to say "Then he said to them."
  * **Nation will rise against nation** - Here "nation" is a metonym for the people of the nation, and "rise against" is a metonym for attack. The word "nation" represents nations in general, not one particular nation. AT: "The people of one nation will attack the people of other nations" or "The people of some nations will attack the people of other nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **Nation** - This refers to ethnic groups of people rather than to countries. 
  * **kingdom against kingdom** - The words "will rise" are understood from the previous phrase and mean attack. AT: "kingdom will rise against kingdom" or "the people of some kingdoms will attack the people of other kingdoms" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_genericnoun]])
  * **in various places famines and plagues** - The words "there will be" are understood from the previous phrase. AT: "there will be famines and plagues in many places" or "there will be times of hunger and diseases in different places" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **terrifying events** - "events that terrify people" or "events that cause people to be very afraid"
