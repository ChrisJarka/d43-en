\v 16 He must remove its crop with its contents, and throw it beside the altar on the east side, in the place of the ashes.
\v 17 He must tear it open by its wings, but must not divide it into two parts. Then the priest will burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire. It is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, to be a sweet smell for Yahweh.
