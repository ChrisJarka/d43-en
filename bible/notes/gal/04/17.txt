\v 17 Those who are insisting on obeying Jewish rules are eagerly showing interest in you, but what they are doing is not good. They even want you not to associate with me and other true believers, because they want you to eagerly show interest in them, not in us.
\v 18 But just like it always feels good to have others show that they appreciate you, I would like you always to appreciate me, and not only when I am with you.

<usfm>
\v 17 They passionately seek you, but for no good. They want to separate you from me so you will follow them.
\v 18 It is good to have others passionately seek you, if it is for the right reason, but all the time and not only when I am present with you.
