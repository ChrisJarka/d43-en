\v 12 Do not \add do anything that would\add* allow the people of Egypt to say, 'Their god led them out from our country, but \add he did that\add* only \add because he wanted\add* to kill them in the mountains and get rid of them completely\f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!' Stop being so angry! Change your mind\f + \ft Or: Do not do what you have told me that you will do \f*! Do not do to your people this terrible thing \add that you have just said that you will do\add*!
\v 13 Think about your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You solemnly promised to them, saying, 'I will enable you to have as many descendants as the stars that are in the sky.' You said to them, 'I will give to your descendants all the land that I am promising to give them. It will be their land forever.'~"
\p
\v 14 So Yahweh changed his mind. He did not do to his people the terrible thing that he said he would do.

\v 12 Why should the Egyptians say, 'For evil  he led them out, to kill them in the mountains, and to destroy them from the face of the earth?' Turn from your burning anger and relent of this evil against your people.
\v 13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self and said to them, 'I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of  I will give to your descendants.  They will  inherit it for ever.'"
\v 14 Then Yahweh relented of the evil that he said he would do to his people.
