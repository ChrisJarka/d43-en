\p
\v 14 They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goes to the battle; for my wrath is upon all the
multitude thereof.
\v 15 The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he
that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
\v 16 But those of them that escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning,
every one in his iniquity.
