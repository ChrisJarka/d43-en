\v 6 Sigh therefore, you son of man; with the breaking of your loins and with bitterness shall you sigh before their eyes.
\v 7 And it shall be, when they say to thee, Wherefore sighest you? that you shall say, Because of the tidings, for it
cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as
water: behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, says the Lord Jehovah.
