====== 1 Thessalonians 02 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Christian witness ==
Paul values the witness he provides for the gospel. He defends himself against attacks against his character, so that his witness is not tainted.

== Christian living ==
Under the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]], people were required to offer sacrifices of animals or grain in the temple, now Christians are required to live their lives as a type of sacrifice to God, since physical sacrifices are no longer required.
