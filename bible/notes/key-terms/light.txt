====== light ======

===== Definition: =====

There are several figurative uses of the term "light" in the Bible. It is often used as a metaphor for righteousness, holiness and truth. It is the opposite of darkness, which represents sin and moral corruption.

  * Jesus said, "I am the light of the world" to express that he brings God's true message to the world and rescues people from the darkness of their sin..
  * Christians are commanded to "walk in the light," which means they should be holy, living the way God wants them to and avoiding evil.
  * The apostle John stated that "God is light," and there is no darkness in him.
  * When translating it is important to keep the metaphors of light and darkness. It may be necessary to explain it in the text. For example, "walk as children of light" could be translated as, "live openly righteous lives, like someone who always walks in bright sunlight."
