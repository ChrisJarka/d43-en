\c 27
\p
\v 1 And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandment which I command you this day.
\v 2 And it shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Jehovah your God gives thee, that you
shall set you up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:
\v 3 and you shall write upon them all the words of this law, when you are passed over; that you may go in to the land
which Jehovah your God gives thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Jehovah, the God of your fathers, has promised thee.
\v 4 And it shall be, when you are passed over the Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in
mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.
\v 5 And there shall you build an altar to Jehovah your God, an altar of stones: you shall lift up no iron
tool upon them.
\v 6 You shall build the altar of Jehovah your God of unhewn stones; and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Jehovah
your God:
\v 7 and you shall sacrifice peace-offerings, and shall eat there; and you shall rejoice before Jehovah your God.
\v 8 And you shall write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.
\p
\v 9 And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, Keep silence, and hearken, O Israel: This day you
are become the people of Jehovah your God.
\v 10 You shall therefore obey the voice of Jehovah your God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command you
this day.
\p
\v 11 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,
\v 12 These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you are passed over the Jordan: Simeon, and Levi, and
Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin.
\v 13 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
\v 14 And the Levites shall answer, and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice,
\p
\v 15 Cursed be the man that makes a graven or molten image, an abomination to Jehovah, the work of the hands of the
craftsman, and sets it up in secret. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.
\p
\v 16 Cursed be he that sets light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\p
\v 17 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbor’s landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\p
\v 18 Cursed be he that makes the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\p
\v 19 Cursed be he that wresteth the justice due to the sojourner, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall
say, Amen.
\p
\v 20 Cursed be he that lies with his father’s wife, because he has uncovered his father’s skirt. And all the people shall
say, Amen.
\p
\v 21 Cursed be he that lies with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\p
\v 22 Cursed be he that lies with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people
shall say, Amen.
\p
\v 23 Cursed be he that lies with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\p
\v 24 Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor in secret. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\p
\v 25 Cursed be he that takes a bribe to kill an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\p
\v 26 Cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.
