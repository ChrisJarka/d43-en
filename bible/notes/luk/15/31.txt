===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus continues telling his parable.)
    * **make merry** - That is, "celebrate."
    * **this brother of yours** - The father was reminding the older son that the one who just came home was his brother. 
    * **was dead and is now alive** - This is a metaphor. The son's leaving his family for a long period of time is compared to being dead, and his returning is compared to being alive again. This could also be translated as "it was as your brother was dead and became alive again." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]])
    *  **he was lost and has now been found** - This is a metaphor. The younger brother's being away from his family for a long period of time is compared to being lost, and his return home is compared to being found. This could also be translated as "it was as if he was lost and has been found" or "he was lost and has returned home."(See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]])
