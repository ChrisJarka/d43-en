====== Months ======

===== Explanation: =====

We have an Important Terms page for biblical months. It explains solar and lunar calendars and gives the approximate length of a month. If a verse mentions a month as a measurement of time, all that is needed is a link to the "biblical month" page:

  * **for seven months** - "for 7 months" (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaltimemonth]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])

But if the verse refers to a specific month, then we need to provide information in the translation notes that will help translators relate the biblical months to their own months and seasons. These notes should include:

  - Equivalent months on western calendars
  - Seasonal and agricultural information if it is relevant to the context

===== Standard Notes: =====

Months are identified in different ways in the Bible. Sometimes the name of the month is used (e.g. Abib, Ziv, Sivan), sometimes it is called by its order in the calendar year (e.g. first month, second month, third month), and sometimes a specific day is included (e.g. "the fifteenth day of the first month"). The notes should be adjusted for each situation and include all relevant links to Important term and Academy pages.

  * **the month of Abib** - This is the name of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. It marks the beginning of the spring season when the late rains come and people begin to harvest their crops. Abib is during the last part of March and the first part of April on western calendars. (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaltimemonth]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])

You only need to mention seasonal or agricultural information if it is relevant to the text.

  * **In the eighth month** - This is the eighth month of the Hebrew calendar. It is during the last part of October and the first part of November on western calendars. (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaltimemonth]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])

When the text provides the day of the month, the note may be a little more specific.

  * **in the third month, on the first day of the month** - This is the third month of the Hebrew calendar. The first day is near the middle of May on western calendars. (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaltime]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
