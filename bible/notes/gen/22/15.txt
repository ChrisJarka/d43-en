  * **you have done this thing**  - This could be translated as "you obeyed me" or "you prepared to offer up Isaac as an offering as I told you to."
  * **have not withheld **- "have not kept back."
  * **your son, your only son **- See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:22:01|22:2]].
  * **greatly multiply**  - "surely increase"
  * **possess the gate of their enemies**  - This is a metonym that means "triumph over their enemies." Armies would break through the gate of their enemies' cities and conquer them. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
