===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (The angel continues speaking to Zechariah:)
    * **For** - That is, "Because" or, "In addition to this." Some translations may not have this word.
    * **he will be great in the sight of the Lord** – That is, "he will be very important in the Lord's opinion" or, "the Lord will consider him to be a very important person. An alternate translation is "he will do very important things for the Lord."
    * **strong drink **- This could be translated as, “other fermented drinks” or, “other intoxicating drinks.” This refers to alcoholic beverages that can cause people to become drunk.
    * **He will be filled with the Holy Spirit **- That is, “The Holy Spirit will empower him” or, “The Holy Spirit will guide him.” If you translate it as "The Holy Spirit will control Him" make sure it does not sound like what an evil spirit might do to a person.
    * **even while in his mother's womb **- This could also be translated as, “even before he is born.” The word “even” indicates that this is especially surprising news. People had been filled with the Holy Spirit before, but no one had heard of an unborn baby being filled with the Holy Spirit.
