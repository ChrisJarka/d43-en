\c 28
\p
\v 1 And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, and say to them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor
to me, shall you observe to offer to me in their due season.
\v 3 And you shall say to them, This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to Jehovah: he-lambs a youar old
without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering.
\v 4 The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb shall you offer at even;
\v 5 and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.
\v 6 It is a continual burnt-offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to
Jehovah.
\v 7 And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shall you pour out a
drink-offering of strong drink to Jehovah.
\v 8 And the other lamb shall you offer at even: as the meal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering thereof, you
shall offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Jehovah.
\p
\v 9 And on the sabbath day two he-lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenth parts
of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof:
\v 10 this is the burnt offering of every sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering, and the drink-offering thereof.
\p
\v 11 And in the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven
he-lambs a year old without blemish;
\v 12 and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and
two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram;
\v 13 and a tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering to every lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet
savor, an offering made by fire to Jehovah.
\v 14 And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the
fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
\v 15 And one he-goat for a sin-offering to Jehovah; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the
drink-offering thereof.
\p
\v 16 And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Jehovahâ€™s passover.
\v 17 And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
\v 18 In the first day shall be a holy convocation: you shall do no servile work;
\v 19 but you shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering to Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven
he-lambs a year old; they shall be to you without blemish;
\v 20 and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall you offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts
for the ram;
\v 21 a tenth part shall you offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;
\v 22 and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.
\v 23 You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.
\v 24 After this manner you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to
Jehovah: it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.
\v 25 And on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work.
\p
\v 26 Also in the day of the first-fruits, when you offer a new meal-offering to Jehovah in your
feast of weeks, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work;
\v 27 but you shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savor to Jehovah: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs a youar
old;
\v 28 and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts for the one
ram,
\v 29 a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;
\v 30 one he-goat, to make atonement for you.
\v 31 Besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, you shall offer them (they shall be to you without
blemish), and their drink-offerings.
