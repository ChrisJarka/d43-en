  * **in the name of our Lord Jesus** - an idiomatic expression for coming together to worship Jesus Christ (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Is it** - This is an idiom in which "it" refers to the remaining content of the sentence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **a child born at the wrong time** - This is an idiom by which Paul may mean that he became a Christian much later than the other apostles. Or he perhaps means that, unlike the other apostles, he did not witness Jesus' three-year-long ministry. AT: "someone who missed the experiences of the others." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **until he has put all his enemies under his feet** - This symbolizes the fact that Christ will conquer all his enemies. AT: "until God has made all of Christ's enemies bow down to him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **no one would be shaken** - to be "shaken" is to be frightened or made afraid. "no one would be frightened away from trusting in Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I could no longer stand it** - "I could not longer wait patiently." Here Paul was describing his own emotions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **if you stand firm in the Lord** - To "stand firm" is to   remain faithful to one's belief in the Lord. AT: "if you continue to trust in the Lord" (UDB) (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **mind your own business** - This means to not interfere with other people's concerns. AT: "attend to your own needs." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
