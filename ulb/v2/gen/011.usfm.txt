\v 1 And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
\v 2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they lived there.
\v 3 And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime
had they for mortar.
\v 4 And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top
may reach to heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
\v 5 And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
\v 6 And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now
nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.
\v 7 Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.
\v 8 So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.
\v 9 Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from
thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

\v 10 These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood:
\v 11 and Shem lived after he became the father of Arpachshad five hundred years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
\p
\v 12 And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and became the father of Shelah:
\v 13 and Arpachshad lived after he became the father of Shelah four hundred and three years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
\p
\v 14 And Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber:
\v 15 and Shelah lived after he became the father of Eber four hundred and three years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
\p
\v 16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and became the father of Peleg:
\v 17 and Eber lived after he became the father of Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
\p
\v 18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu:
\v 19 and Peleg lived after he became the father of Reu two hundred and nine years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
\p
\v 20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and became the father of Serug:
\v 21 and Reu lived after he became the father of Serug two hundred and seven years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
\p
\v 22 And Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor:
\v 23 and Serug lived after he became the father of Nahor two hundred years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
\p
\v 24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and became the father of Terah:
\v 25 and Nahor lived after he became the father of Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
\p
\v 26 And Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
\p
\v 27 Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran became the father of Lot.
\v 28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
\v 29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the
daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
\v 30 And Sarai was barren; She had no child.
\v 31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s
wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and lived
there.
\v 32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
