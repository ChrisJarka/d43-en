\v 15 "Beware of people who come to you and say falsely that they are telling you what God has said. They seem to be harmless, but they are extremely harmful. They are like wolves that have covered themselves with sheepskins to make people believe that they are sheep but they actually are
wolves that attack people.
\v 16 So how will you know that they are false? Well, by seeing what plants produce, you know what kind of plants they are. For example, thornbushes cannot
produce grapes, so no one can pick grapes from thornbushes. And thistles cannot produce figs, so no one can pick figs from thistles.
\v 17 Here is another example: All good fruit trees produce good fruit, but all rotten trees produce worthless fruit.

\p
\v 15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheepâ€™s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.
\v 16 By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
\v 17 Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.
