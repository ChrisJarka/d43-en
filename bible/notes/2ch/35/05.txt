===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Stand in the holy place, taking your positions** - "Take your positions in the temple area"
  * **your divisions** - This refers to the work group to which the people had assigned each Levite. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:35:03|35:4]].
  * **the ancestral houses** - This refers to the various clans among the Levites. It seems that Levites were assigned to different work groups on the basis of the kind of work assigned to each clan or ancestral house. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:35:03|35:4]].
  * **consecrate yourselves** - This probably referred to the priests and Levites washing themselves before they did work in the temple.
  * **to do according to the word of Yahweh that was given by the hand of Moses** - Here the word "hand" refers to Moses himself. Yahweh used Moses as the agent to deliver his command. This can be translated in active form. AT: "to obey all of the commands that Yahweh gave to the people through Moses" or "to do everything that Yahweh commanded Moses to tell the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
