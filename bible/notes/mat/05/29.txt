\v 29 If because of what you see \f + \ft metonymy \f* you \add are tempted to\add* sin, \add stop looking at those things! Even if you have to\add* gouge out one of your eyes and throw it away \f + \ft hyperbole \f* \add to avoid sinning, do it!\add* It is good \add that you not sin and\add* as a result \add go to heaven, even though while you are still here on earth\add* you lack one \add or both of\add* your eyes. But it is not good \add that you continue to have two eyes and sin and, as a result, God\add* sends your whole body to hell.
\v 30 If you are \add tempted to\add* use one of your hands to sin \f + \ft metonymy \f*, \add stop using your hand. Even if you have to\add* cut your hand off and throw it away\add to avoid sinning, do it\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f*! It is good \add that you do not sin and as a result you go to heaven, even though while you are still here on earth\add* you lack one \add or both\add* of your \add hands\add*. But it is not good \add that you sin and, as a result, God\add* sends your whole body to hell."

\v 29 If you want to sin because you have looked at certain things, then stop looking at them.  Even if you have to destroy both of your eyes, do it if that would make you able to avoid sinning. It would be better to be blind and stop sinning, than for God to throw you into hell while you can still see.
\v 30 And if you want to use one of your hands to sin, stop using your hand. Even if you have to cut your hand off and throw it away, do it if that would make you able to avoid sinning. It would be better to be blind and stop sinning, than for God to throw you into hell while you still have both your hands."

<usfm>
\v 29 And if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you; for it is better for you that one
of your body parts should perish, than that your whole body should be thrown into hell.
\v 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you; for it is better for you that one
of your body parts should perish, than that your whole body should go into hell.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you** - Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen in their individual lives.
  * **if your right eye causes** - This metonymy is used in connecting the eyes to the functions they are used for. Think of it as if the eye alone is the start of actions or choice to look at bad things. (UDB) (See TAlink: Metonymy)
  * **pluck it out** - "forcefully remove it." This hyperbole is the exaggerated action Jesus suggested to express his strong dislike for looking at bad things. (See TAlink: Hyperbole)
  * **throw it away from you** - "get rid of it totally" or "put it in the trash and proceed without it" This hyperbole is the exaggerated action Jesus suggested to express his strong dislike for eyes used to look at bad things. (See TAlink: Hyperbole)
  * **one of your body parts should perish** - "give up one part of your body to death." The idea is like trading a small part of your body to protect the rest of the body from death.
  * **if your right hand causes** - This metonymy is used in connecting the hand to the actions they are used for. Think of all the other body parts needed to help the hand move referred to as just the hand. (See TAlink: Metonymy)
  * **cut it off** - "severe it totally" This hyperbole is the exaggerated action Jesus suggested to express his strong dislike for hands performing wrong actions. (See TAlink: Hyperbole)
