<usfm>
\v 30 As for you, you human, your fellow Israelites \add here in Babylon\add* are talking about you along the city walls and at the doors of their houses. They are saying to each other, 'Come and listen to the message that has come from Yahweh.'
\v 31 My people come to you as they often have done, and they sit in front of you to listen to what you say. But they do not do what you tell them that they must do. With their mouths they say that they love me, but in their inner beings they are eager to acquire things by doing what is unjust.

\v 30 And as for you, son of man, the children of your people talk of you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and
speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that comes forth from
Jehovah.
\v 31 And they come to you as the people cometh, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but do them
not; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their gain.
