===== Workspace Layout =====

//This answers the question:// //What considerations are there in laying out a project workspace?//

The layout of the workspace for the recording team is an important consideration for a recording project. A workspace that is laid out well helps to bring the team together and make the work flow effective. A poorly configured workspace can cause the team to feel disconnected and make many repetitive tasks take longer.

Because every workspace will be different across the world, we cannot speak specifically to each scenario. What we can do is provide key concepts that we consider when laying out a workspace. These concepts can then be applied by the recording team to their unique recording environment.

==== Organized & Tidy ====

We recommend creating a workspace that is easy to keep organized, clean and tidy. Of course, people must maintain it and care for it. But the layout often sets a tone for how people decide, and are able, to maintain it. Here are some suggestions:

  * Layout the equipment and positions of the team so that cables are not stretched across areas where people must walk or in ways that make a desk messy.
  * In advance, make provision for equipment like headphones, notepads, pens, etc. to have a “home”. This helps prevent items from being lost or damaged.

==== Minimize Distractions ====

Avoid placing the narrator in a position where there are many visual distractions, such as facing a window or a door. They will be too easily distracted by other activities happening nearby.

==== Minimize Acoustical Challenges ====

There are certain locations in a room that will typically be prone to more acoustical challenges than others. Avoiding these locations when positioning the narrator and the microphone's listening direction can help decrease acoustical challenges. Generally, these are locations to avoid:
  * Near to a wall
  * Near a window
  * The exact center of a square or rectangular shaped room.

==== Visual Connectivity ====

Perhaps one element that draws a team together and helps their work flow more than anything else is good visual communication within the team and in interaction with the display of the audio waveform. Unless a circumstance proves otherwise, we tend to discourage traditional layouts where:
  * the recordist has exclusive view of the screen where the audio file and waveform are displayed.
  * The recordist and the narrator are in separate rooms.

Instead, positioning the team in the same room with open visual communication with each other and with the audio data can give the team a better sense of truly working together as a team and making the best use of time and information.

==== Suitable furniture ====

Recording projects require many hours of patient work, so it is important that the team is comfortable and able to work productively. Provisions might include comfortable chairs and a small desk or table. There should also be enough lighting, natural or lamp, for the team to read text without straining their eyes.

//One special note about chairs:// 

Be careful of chairs that swivel, rock or have metal legs and casters. These may contribute unwanted sounds to your recording. Quite naturally, if chairs swivel, rock or have loose metal pieces, someone on the team will be making their chair squeak, creak or clank accidentally.
