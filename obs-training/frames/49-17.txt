Even though you are a **[[:en:obe:kt:christian|Christian]]**, you will still **be [[:en:obe:kt:tempt|tempted]] to [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]]**. But God **is [[:en:obe:kt:faithful|faithful]]** and says that if you **confess your sins**, he  will **[[:en:obe:kt:forgive|forgive]]** you. **He will give you strength to fight against sin**.
