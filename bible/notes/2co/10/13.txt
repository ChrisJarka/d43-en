\v 13 But as for me, I will not boast about \add working among people living in\add* areas outside of the areas \add that God sent\f + \ft Or: assigned \f* me to work in\add*. But \add it is right for\add* me to say that \add I have worked\add* in the areas that God assigned to me. \add And since those areas\add* include the one where you live,
\v 14 \add when I talk about working among you\add*, I am not boasting \add about working in an area where God did not give me the right to work. What those who oppose me say about my not having authority as an apostle to you might be true\add* if I had not already come all the way to your area. \add But that is not true\add*, because I was the one who first brought the message about Christ to you. \add I came to Corinth before they did\add*!

\v 13 But we will not boast more than we should, but will keep within the area that God assigned to us, which includes reaching you.
\v 14 For we did not overextend ourselves when we reached you;  for we came as far as we did to you with the gospel of Christ.
