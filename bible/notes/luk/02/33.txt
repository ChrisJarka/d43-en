    * **is destined for the falling and rising of many people in Israel**  - Spiritually, people would either accept or reject Jesus, bringing them closer to God ("rising") or further from God ("falling"). (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]])
    * **for a sign which is spoken against**  - The birth of the Savior through a virgin birth was a miracle, which would be denied as being possible or effective.
    * **a sword will pierce your own soul**  - This metaphor "You will experience be very, very sad." It could also be translated as "You will grieve deeply" or, "Your sadness will be painful like a sword piercing your heart" or, "Your heart will break." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]])
