\v 5 While I was listening, he said to the other six men, "Follow the man wearing the white robe, and kill people. Do not pity them or act mercifully toward them.
\v 6 Slaughter old men, young men and women, older women and children, but do not harm any of those who have that mark on their forehead. Start at my temple." So they began by killing the elders who were \add worshiping idols\add* in front of the temple.

\v 5 And to the others he said in my hearing, Go you through the city after him, and smite: let not your eyou spare, neither have
you pity;
\v 6 kill utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom
is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house.
