\c 4
\p
\v 1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone
out into the world.
\v 2 Hereby know you the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
\v 3 and every spirit that confesses not Jesus is not of God: and this is the
spirit of the antichrist, whereof you have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already.
\v 4 You are of God, my little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is
in the world.
\v 5 They are of the world: therefore speak they as of the world, and the world hears them.
\v 6 We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he who is not of God hears us not. By this we know the spirit of truth,
and the spirit of error.
\p
\v 7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is begotten of God, and knows God.
\v 8 He that loves not knows not God; for God is love.
\v 9 Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live
through him.
\v 10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son
to be the propitiation for our sins.
\v 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
\v 12 No man has [*]saw God at any time: if we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is perfected in us:
\v 13 hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
\v 14 And we have [*]saw and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son
to be the Saviour of the world.
\v 15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.
\v 16 And we know and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love; and he that remains in love remains in God, and
God remains in him.
\v 17 Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we
in this world.
\v 18 There is no fear in love: but perfect love throws out fear, because fear has punishment; and he that fears is not
made perfect in love.
\v 19 We love, because he first loved us.
\v 20 If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen,
cannot love God whom he has not seen.
\v 21 And this commandment have we from him, that he who loves God love his brother also.
