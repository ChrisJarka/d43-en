===== Description =====
**Proverbs** are short concise statements of wisdom, often using metaphor and parallelism. **Riddles** are short hidden statements of truth that the hearer has to guess its meaning. \\ 
Example of a proverb: **Look at the ant, you lazy person, consider her ways, and be wise.** (Proverbs 6:6)  \\ 
**Reason this is a translation issue:** \\
Each language has its own way of stating proverbs. There are many proverbs in the Bible. They need to be put in the form of your language proverbs for people to recognize them as proverbs.



===== Examples from the Bible =====
**ULB Text.** (Proverbs 22:1) - **A good name is to be chosen over great riches, and favor is better than silver and gold.** This is a proverb as it is a short bit of wisdom. \\
\\
**(1 Corinthians 15:55) Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?"** This is a proverb because in these short words it gives the wisdom that death is no longer final.

===== Translation Strategies =====
If translating the proverb literally would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider translating literally. If not, here are other options: \\ 

  - If certain objects in the proverb are not known to many in your language group, consider replacing them with known objects that function in the same way in your language. 
  - Substitute a proverb in your language that has the same teaching as the proverb in the Bible.
  - Give the same teaching but not in a form of a proverb.
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
\\ 
1. If certain objects in the proverb are not known to many in your language group, consider replacing them with known objects that function in the same way in your language.
    * **Like __snow in summer__ or rain in harvest, so a fool does not deserve honor.** (Proverbs 26:1)
    * As it is not natural for __a cold wind to blow in the hot season__ or for it to rain in the harvest season; so it is not natural to honor a foolish person.
 
2. Substitute a proverb in your language that has the same teaching as the proverb in the Bible.
    * **Do not boast about tomorrow** (Proverbs 27:1)
    * Do not cross your bridges before you come to them.

3. Give the same teaching but not in a form of a proverb.\\ 
  * **A generation that curses their father and does not bless their mother,** (Proverbs 30:11)  
    * "Some people do not respect their parents."
