====== Ellipsis ======


===== Description =====

Ellipsis is where words are left out of the sentence because it is not needed to be understood. The information that is omitted has usually already been stated in a preceding sentence or phrase, or it is part of the context. Ellipsis is somewhat different than implied information because implied information does not involve partial sentences.
