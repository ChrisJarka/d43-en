====== Parables ======

  *

Actually, the tA page for translating parables might be very short. I’m not wording this well yet, but it could teach people __not__  to explain the story or what Jesus was teaching, but simply to translate the story as a story. Their language may have a way of communicating that a narrative is a story (or even a story whose purpose is to teach something) and not an account of a historical event.

There’s another issue. Not all things that are called parables in Greek are stories. Perhaps we could just refer to them as ”situations” (This might even overlap with the idea of hypothetical situations.)

__Lu 4:23__* And he said unto them, Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in thine own country.

__Lu 5:36__* And he spake also a parable unto them: No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment; else he will rend the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old.

__Lu 6:39__* And he spake also a parable unto them, Can the blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit?

The following passage seems to be a combination of a parable and simile. Jesus actually used the words ”compare” and ”like” so it seems to be a simile. But the translation suggestions on the page for Simile would not be appropriate here.

Luke 7:31,32

"To what then should I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like? 32They are like children playing in the marketplace, who sit and call to one another and say, 'We played a flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned, and you did not weep.'
