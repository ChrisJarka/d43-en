**What is 1 Chronicles about?**\\
The purpose of the 1 Chronicles was to retell the genealogy of Adam to Jacob (who is known as Israel), and then trace some of the history of Israel leading up to the death of David.

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\ 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "1 Kings" is named for the events of the book which focus on the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah. It is likely that the books of 1 and 2 Kings were originally one book but were separated because they could not be printed together in one volume. One possible title is "The book about the kings."

**Who wrote 1 Chronicles?**\\
The book of 1 Chronicles likely contains many different historical accounts which were put together. The writers of Chronicles refer to other resources that they used in writing their history but they may have been written or edited by Ezra.

**Why are there multiple books which give the history of the kings of Israel?**\\
Though Chronicles covers much of the same history as the books of Kings, they do not repeat everything. The books of Kings have many omissions from the Chronicles, and there are also some additions in one history that is not found in the other. The purpose of Chronicles is not simply to retell the history of Israel and Judah, repeating the books of Kings, but to reaffirm the relationship between Yahweh and his people, even though the nation of Israel (and Judah) had been effectively destroyed, and was being rebuilt. To that end, Chronicles focuses on David and Solomon and the reformation accomplished by Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah. Those reformations were to serve encouragements for all the people of Israel and their leaders to obey the Law and to honor Yahwehâ€™s covenant with them, as they work on the rebuilding of the nation and the Temple.
