<usfm>
\q
\v 16 Yahweh of hosts says this: "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. 
\q They have deluded you! They are announcing visions from their own minds, not from Yahweh's mouth.
\q
\v 17 They are constantly saying those who dishonor me, ‘Yahweh declares there will be peace for you.’
\q And everyone walking in the stubbornness of his own heart says, ‘Disaster will not come upon you.’
\q
\v 18 Yet who has stood in Yahweh's council meeting? Who sees and hears his word?
\q Who pays attention to his word and listens?
