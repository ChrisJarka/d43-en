I consider them \add as useless as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* rubbish, in order that I may have \add a close relationship with\add* Christ \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\v 9 and in order that I may completely belong to him. It was not as a result of \add my obeying\add* the laws \add he gave Moses\add* that God erased the record of my sins.

\v 8 More than that, I consider all things to be worthless, compared to how great it is to know Christ Jesus my Lord. Because I want to know him better ,
\v 9 and in order that I may completely belong to him. It was not as a result of my obeying the laws he gave Moses that God erased the record of my sins. Instead, it is because I have trusted in Christ that God has declared the guilt for my sins to be ended and he enables me to act righteously. It is God himself who has erased the record of my sins, and he enables me to act righteously, only because I have trusted in Christ.
\v 10 I want to know Christ better and better. Particularly, I want to continually experience his working powerfully in me, just like God worked powerfully when he caused Christ to become alive after he died. I also want to be continually willing to suffer in order that I may obey God, just like Christ suffered in order that he might obey God. I also want to be completely willing to die for Christ, even as he died for me,
\v 11 because I expect that, as a result of God's goodness, he will cause me to live again after I have died.

\v 8 Yes truly, I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. The things I lost are but refuse that I may gain Christ.
\v 9 And be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, even that which is of the law. But I have the righteousness from God which is through faith in Christ.
\v 10 So that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death.
\v 11  So that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead by any means possible.
