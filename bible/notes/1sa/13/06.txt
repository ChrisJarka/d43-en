\v 6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people did hide
themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.
\v 7 Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and
all the people followed him trembling.
