<usfm>
\v 6 As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is perished long ago; neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is done under the sun.
\v 7 Go your way, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.
\v 8 Let your garments be always white; and let not your head lack oil.
