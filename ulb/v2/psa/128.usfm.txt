\c 128
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q
\v 1 Blessed is every one that fears Jehovah,
\q That walks in his ways.
\q
\v 2 For you shall eat the labor of your hands:
\q Happy shall you be, and it shall be well with thee.
\q
\v 3 Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine,
\q In the innermost parts of your house;
\q Your children like olive plants,
\q Round about your table.
\q
\v 4 Behold, thus shall the man be blessed
\q That fears Jehovah.
\q
\v 5 Jehovah bless you out of Zion:
\q And see you the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
\q
\v 6 Yea, see you your childrenâ€™s children.
\q Peace be upon Israel.
