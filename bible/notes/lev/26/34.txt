\v 34 Then will the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate  and you are in your enemiesâ€™ land. During that time will the land rest and enjoy its sabbaths.
\v 35 As long as it lies desolate it will have rest, which is the rest which it did not have in your sabbaths, when you lived upon it.
\v 36 As for those of you who are left in the land of your enemies, I will send  fear into their hearts so that the sound of a leaf blown by the wind will startle them, and they will flee as if fleeing  from the sword. They will fall when no one is pursuing them.
