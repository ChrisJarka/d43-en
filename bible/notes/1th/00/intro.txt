=== What is the Book of 1 Thessalonians about? ===

Paul and Silas had been imprisoned in Philippi (Acts 16:16ff.), and after their release they went to Thessalonica. Paul visited the city of Thessalonica (see Acts 17:1-9) during his Second Missionary Journey (Acts 15:36-18:22). There work was very successful and quickly they had established a new worshiping church. The new church reached some Jewish people who believed that Jesus was the Messiah (see Acts 17:4). There were many devout Greeks, “God-fearers,” (who followed the Jewish faith, except for circumcision), and when they believed in Jesus as the Messiah they became the core of the new church. There were also many influential women in the church (see 1 Thess. 1:9).
 
The Jewish synagogue in Thessalonica stirred up opposition and mob-violence against the Thessalonian church. They attacked Jason's home (Jason was one of the church leaders), where Paul and his friends had been staying. Jason was arrested. This attack caused the church to ask that Paul and his friends to leave the city, for their protection. They went to the neighboring city of Berea. But soon the Jews of Thessalonica came to Berea, forcing Paul to leave there, as well.
 
Paul and his friends left again, and they went first to Athens. From there Paul sent Timothy back to Thessalonica to check on the church there. Paul continued on the Corinth and it was there (in Corinth) that Timothy found Paul. Timothy came to Paul and gave him his report about the Thessalonian church. Timothy's report was the occasion for Paul to write back to the Thessalonians, and that letter is our 1 Thessalonians, and it was written from Corinth.


=== Who wrote the Book of 1 Thessalonians? ===

First Thessalonians is the earliest letter of the Apostle Paul, written about AD 50-51. Thessalonica (modern Thessaloniki) was located on a major trade highway, the Via Engatia, or the Roman Highway, and was a prosperous trading center. The city had a thriving Jewish population with an active Jewish Synagogue (see Acts 17:1).
