\v 13 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? or will
you flee three months before your foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three daysâ€™ pestilence in your land? now advise
thee, and consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
\v 14 And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah; for his mercies are great; and
let me not fall into the hand of man.
