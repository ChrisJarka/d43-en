\v 14 I looked, and behold, there was a white cloud. On the cloud was one sitting like a Son of Man, having on his head a gold crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
\v 15 Another angel came out from the temple, who cried with a great voice to him who sat on the cloud, "Extend your sickle and reap. For the hour to reap has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe."
\v 16 He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.
