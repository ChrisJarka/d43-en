\v 1 Now there were some present at that very season who told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
\v 2 And he answered and said to them, Think you that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they have suffered these things?
\v 3 I tell you, No: but, except you repent, you shall all in like manner perish.
