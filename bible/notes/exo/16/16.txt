\v 16 This is the word that Yahweh has commanded, 'You should gather, every person the amount you need to eat, an omer for each person, according to the total number of people. This is how you will gather it: Gather to enough to eat for every one for those who live within his tent.'"
\v 17 The people of Israel did so. Some gathered more, some gathered less.
\v 18 When they measured it with an omer, he who had gathered much had nothing over, and he who had gathered little had no lack. Each one gathered so that they had enough to meet their need.
