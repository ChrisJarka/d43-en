\v 2 Throughout the empire, the Jews gathered together in their cities to attack those who wanted to get rid of them. No one could fight against the Jews, because all the other people in the areas where the Jews lived were afraid of the Jews, \add so they did not want to help anyone who attacked the Jews\add*.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the kingâ€™s commandment and his
decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them (whereas it was
turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them),
\v 2 the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on
such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples.
