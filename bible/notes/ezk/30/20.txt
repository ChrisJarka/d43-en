===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **broken the arm of Pharaoh**  - "broken the power of Pharaoh" or "broken the control of Pharaoh". (See:Metaphor)
  * **Behold**  - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
  * <font 14px line-height: 19px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>** It is not bound up to receive medicine and to set a bandage to bind it  ** - This phrase is used in reference to the metaphor of the broken arm. Pharaoh's power will not be restored.</font>
  * **so it will be not be strong enough**- The "it" here is the broken arm. Because the wound will not be bandaged, it will not be healed and capable of grasping a sword.
