\v 22 Some people hear God's message,  but they desire to be rich, so they worry only about money and what they can buy with money. As a result, they forget God's message and they do not do the things that God wants them to do. These people are like the soil that had the roots of thorny weeds in it.
\v 23 But some people hear my message and understand it. Some of them do many things that please God, some do even more things that please God, and some do very many things that please God. They are like the good soil where some of the seeds fell."

\v 22 He who was sown among the thorn plants, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness 
of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
\v 23 He who was sown on the good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; this is he who truly produces 
fruit and brings it forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty."
