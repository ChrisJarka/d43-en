===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (This is what Jesus read on the scroll.)
    * **The Spirit of the Lord is upon me**  - That is, "God is with me in a special way." Someone saying this is claiming to speak directly the words of God.
    * **to preach good news to the poor**  - That is, to preach to those who are in extreme poverty, destitute or possibly homeless.
    * **to set free those who are oppressed**  - That is, "to send with release those having been broken."
    * **to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord**  - That is, "to proclaim that the Lord is ready to bless his people."
    * **favorable**  - This word originally meant "right-handed" because a person showed acceptance with the right hand and rejection with the left hand. Your culture and language may do something similar.
