\c 10
\p
\v 1 And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he lived in
Shamir in the hill-country of Ephraim.
\v 2 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
\p
\v 3 And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty and two years.
\v 4 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth-jair to this
day, which are in the land of Gilead.
\v 5 And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
\p
\v 6 And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim, and the
Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the
gods of the Philistines; and they forsook Jehovah, and served him not.
\v 7 And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand
of the children of Ammon.
\v 8 And they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year: eighteen years
oppressed they all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in
Gilead.
\v 9 And the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house
of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
\p
\v 10 And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah, saying, We have sinned against thee, even because we have forsaken our
God, and have served the Baalim.
\v 11 And Jehovah said to the children of Israel, Did not
I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
\v 12 The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out of
their hand.
\v 13 Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will save you no more.
\v 14 Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.
\v 15 And the children of Israel said to Jehovah, We have sinned: do you to us whatever seems good to thee; only
deliver us, we pray thee, this day.
\v 16 And they put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Jehovah; and his soul was grieved for the misery of
Israel.
\p
\v 17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled
themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.
\v 18 And the people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children
of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
