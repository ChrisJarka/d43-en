====== Jeremiah 07:31-32 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 31 They have built altars at Topheth in Hinnom Valley \add outside Jerusalem\add*,
\q2 and they sacrifice their sons and daughters on those altars.
\q1 I never commanded them to do that;
\q2 I never even thought that anyone would do that.
\q1
\v 32 So they should beware!
\q2 There will be a time when that place will no longer be called Topheth or the Hinnom Valley;
\q2 instead, it will be called the Valley of Slaughter.
\q1 There will be a huge number of people who will be buried there,
\q2 with the result that there will be no space to bury more bodies.

<usfm>
\v 31 And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their
daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind.
\v 32 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of
Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place
to bury.
