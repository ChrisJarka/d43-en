\v 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes on him should not perish, but
have eternal life.
\v 17 For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.
\v 18 He that believes on him is not judged: he that believes not has been judged already, because he has not believed on
the name of the only begotten Son of God.
