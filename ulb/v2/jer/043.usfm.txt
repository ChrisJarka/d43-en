\c 43
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Jehovah their
God, wherewith Jehovah their God had sent him to them, even all these words,
\v 2 then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, You
speak falsely: Jehovah our God has not sent you to say, You shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there;
\v 3 but Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put
us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.
\v 4 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of Jehovah, to
dwell in the land of Judah.
\v 5 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from
all the nations whither they had been driven, to sojourn in the land of Judah;
\v 6 the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the
guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;
\v 7 and they came into the land of Egypt; for they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah: and they came to Tahpanhes.
\p
\v 8 Then came the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
\v 9 Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brickwork, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in
Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;
\v 10 and say to them, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king
of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over
them.
\v 11 And he shall come, and shall strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death
shall be given to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.
\v 12 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and he
shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
\v 13 He shall also break the pillars of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall
he burn with fire.
