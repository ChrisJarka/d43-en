\v 17 After seventy years Yahweh will visit Tyre, and she will return to her hire.
She  will prostitute herself with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
\v 18 Her profit and her earnings will be holy to the Lord. They will not be stored up. They will not  be for her merchandise, but instead
will be for them that dwell before Yahwah, so they may eat sufficiently and have durable clothing.
