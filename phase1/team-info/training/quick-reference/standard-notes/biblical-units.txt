====== Biblical units ======

===== Definition: =====

We have Important Term page for the major categories of Biblical units. However, if we link them in the Important Terms section, the general title will appear rather than the title of the individual unit (cubit, denarius, etc.). Therefore, we suggest that the unit be included in a note, followed by the link to the appropriate term page.


===== Standard Notes: =====

=== New Note Style for ATs with metric equivalents ===

The two notes below might be clearer and simpler than notes further down this page that involve metric equivalents. When giving a metric equivalent, it would be good use one that does not conflict with the equivalent in the UDB. But it would be good to omit "about" in the translation suggestion when the measurement is regarding something that God has commanded. (God was not telling people to use "about" a certain amount.)

  * **three tenths of an ephah** - You may convert this to a modern measure. AT: "six and one half liters" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_bvolume]])
