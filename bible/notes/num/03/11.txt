\v 11 And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 12 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that opens the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine:
\v 13 for all the firstborn are mine; on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed to me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast; mine they shall be: I am Jehovah.
