\c 11
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in
their cities.
\p
\v 2 Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent by his disciples
\v 3 and said to him, Are you he that cometh, or look we for another?
\v 4 And Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:
\v 5 the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up,
and the poor have good tidings preached to them.
\v 6 And blessed is he, whoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.
\p
\v 7 And as these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went you out into the wilderness
to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?
\v 8 But what went you out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft
raiment are in kingsâ€™ houses.
\v 9 But wherefore went you out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
\v 10 This is he, of whom it is written,
\q Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
\q Who shall prepare your way before thee.
\m
\v 11 Verily I say to you, Among them that are born of women there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: yet he
that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
\v 12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by
force.
\v 13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
\v 14 And if you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, that is to come.
\v 15 He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
\v 16 But whereto shall I liken this generation? It is like to children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their
fellows
\v 17 and say, We piped to you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not mourn.
\v 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.
\v 19 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans
and sinners! And wisdom is justified by her works.
\p
\v 20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not.
\v 21 Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were
done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 But I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you.
\v 23 And you, Capernaum, shall you be exalted to heaven? you shall go down to Hades: for if the mighty works had been
done in Sodom which were done in thee, it would have remained until this day.
\v 24 But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
\p
\v 25 At that season Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you did hide these
things from the wise and understanding, and did reveal them to babes:
\v 26 yea, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.
\v 27 All things have been delivered to me of my Father: and no one knows the Son, save the Father; neither does any know
the Father, save the Son, and he to whoever the Son willeth to reveal
him.
\v 28 Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
\v 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.
\v 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
