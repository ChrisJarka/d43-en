===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **when they were only few in number, so very few**  - These phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. AT: "when the people is Israel were a very small group of people" 
    * **and were strangers in the land**  - AT: "and were foreigners in the land of Canaan" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
    * **They went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another**  - This refers to the time before the people of Israel arrived in Canaan, when Abraham and his descendants lived in many different lands that did not belong to them.
