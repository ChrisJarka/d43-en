===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 27 None of you can, just by worrying, add years to your life. You cannot add even one minute to your life! So you should not worry about things you need. \p \v 28 You should also not worry about whether you will have enough clothes to wear. Think about the way flowers grow in the fields. They do not work to earn money, and they do not make their own clothes. \v 29 But I tell you that even though King Solomon, who lived long ago, wore very beautiful clothes, his clothes were not as beautiful as one of those flowers. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 27 And which one of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his lifespan? \v 28 And why are you anxious about clothing? Think about the lilies in the fields, how they grow; they do not work, and they do not spin cloth. \v 29 Yet I say to you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in 5:1.

  * Jesus continues talking about the importance of lives of people.
  * **And which one of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his lifespan?**  - This is a rhetorical question explaining that you cannot add length of time to your life.
  * **you**  - The pronoun “you” refers to all people in the crowd that Jesus is talking to.
  * **And why are you anxious about clothing?**  - This rhetorical question is scolding people for being worried about things in their lives for no reason. This can be translated as "you are still concerned about what you will wear." (See: Rhetorical Question)
  * **Think**  - This could be translated "consider."
  * **Think about the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not work, and they do not spin cloth**  This is personification. (see: UDB)
