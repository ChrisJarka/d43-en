\v 15 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that
we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work.
\v 16 And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears,
the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.
