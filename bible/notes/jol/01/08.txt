===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - God continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **the ground is mourning** - Here the land is spoken of as if it were a person. These words could also be seen as a metonym for the people who are mourning or even as hyperbole, that the famine is so bad that even things that are not alive are mourning. AT: "the farmers are mourning" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **the grain has been destroyed** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "the locusts have destroyed all of the grain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
