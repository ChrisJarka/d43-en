====== set apart, chosen ======

===== Definition: =====

Text

  * Set apart or chosen in the context of Galatians 1 means that God decided to enter into a relationship with Paul not because Paul was seeking it but just because God wanted to do it. Individual people are also chosen by God to become His children through Christ. To be set apart to God means the believer becomes dedicated to God and to fulfilling His will because God has entered into a relationship with the individual and shown Himself to the individual.
