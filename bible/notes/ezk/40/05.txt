\v 5 And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the manâ€™s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a
cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
\v 6 Then came he to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of
the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.
\v 7 And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and the
space between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one
reed.
