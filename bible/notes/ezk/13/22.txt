====== Ezekiel 13:22-23 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 You have discouraged righteous people by telling them lies when I did not do things to cause them to be sad. And you have encouraged wicked people to not turn away from their wicked behavior; if they had done that, they would have continued to remain alive.
\v 23 Therefore, you will no longer falsely say that you have seen visions or tell people what will happen in the future in order to please them. I will rescue my people from being deceived by you. And then you will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.'~"

<usfm>
\v 22 Because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad, and strengthened the hands of the
wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive;
\v 23 Therefore you shall no more see false visions, nor divine divinations: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and
you shall know that I am Jehovah.
