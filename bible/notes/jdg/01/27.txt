\v 27 Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and its towns, nor
of Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor
the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns. Instead, the Canaanites were able to continue living in those places.
\v 28 It came about, when Israel was strong, that they would put the Canaanites to hard labor, but they never completely drove them out.
