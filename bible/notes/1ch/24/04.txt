\v 4 There were more leading men among Eleazar's descendants than among Ithamar's descendants, so they divided Eleazar's descendants into sixteen groups. They did this by clan heads and by Ithamar's descendants. These divisions were eight in number, corresponding to their clans.
\v 5 They divided them impartially by lot, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of God, from both  
Eleazar's descendants and Ithamar's descendants.
