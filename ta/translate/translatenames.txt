Sometimes the target language may not have a word for a certain person, place, or thing that is in the source text. Learn how to borrow or copy words from the source text to the target language on [[:en:ta:translate:translatenames:transliterate|this page]].

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Luke 1:3**
“Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I also have decided to write a careful account for you, most honorable Theophilus.”

//Honorable would describe a person.  So honorable points to the fact that Theophilus is the name of a person.//

**Psalms 72:2**
"Jerusalem is where he lives; Mount Zion is his home." 

//Here the words Mount Zion refers to the mountain landform.//

**John 21:1**
“Later, Jesus appeared again to the disciples beside the Sea of Galilee.”  

//The text refers to the Sea of Galilee.  Sea would be your clue that the Sea of Galilee is a body of water.//


===== Translation Suggestions =====

There are many things to keep in mind when translating a name.

  * Proper names sometimes reveal information about the person, place, or thing it refers to.
  * Proper names of people may reveal something about the origin or history of the family.
  * Proper names of people may reveal something about a characteristic of the person.
  * Sometimes proper names of people and proper names of places have more than one name.

There are several ways to handle names when translating the Bible:

  * Copy the proper name from the source language into the target language with no change of the spelling, symbols, or sound.
  * Pronounce the name as it is pronounced in the source language, and using the target language's spelling system. Write the new proper name in a way that people will read it with the source language's pronunciation.
  * Spell the name as it is spelled in the source language, but pronounce the word according to how the target language pronounces those symbols.​
  * Translate the meaning of the name.
  * If a person or place has two names, use the name that occurs in the particular text you are translating.
  * If a person or place has two names, use one name most of the time and the other name only when the text talks about the name or its meaning.
