\v 13 Gideon crept closer and heard one man telling a friend about a dream. He said, "I just had a dream, and in the dream I saw a round loaf of barley bread tumble down into our Midian camp. It struck a tent so hard that the tent turned upside down and collapsed!"
\p
\v 14 His friend said, "Your dream can mean only one thing. It means that God will enable Gideon, the man of Israel, to defeat all of the armies that are here with us men from Midian."

\v 13 When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his companion; the man said, “See, I had a dream; see, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, came to the tent, and struck down it so that it fell; it turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat.”
\v 14 His companion answered and said, “This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash, a man of Israe. God has delivered Midian and all the army into his hand.”
