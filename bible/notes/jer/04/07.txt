<usfm>
\v 7 A lion goes up from his thicket and one who destroys nations sets out. He goes out from his place to bring horror to your land, your ruined cities where there is none inhabiting them!
\v 8 Because of this, wrap yourself in sackcloth; lament and wail! For the anger of the wrath of Yahweh has not turned away from us!
