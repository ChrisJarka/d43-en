===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[en:obe:other:wine]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:strongdrink]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:priest]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:vision]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But even these** - "But even the priests and prophets"
  * **reel...stagger** - These words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the priests and prophets have drank so much wine that it is hard for them to stand or to walk. Either word could be translated as "stumble," "stagger," or "walk unsteadily." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **they are swallowed up by wine** - Here "wine" is described as a person with the ability to swallow. This emphasizes that the wine is destroying the prophets and priests. AT: "They think they are swallowing the wine but it is like the wine is swallowing them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **staggering in vision and reeling in decision** - They do not only stumble when walking, they also stumble when they try to think. Because they are drunk, they are not able to understand the meanings of visions correctly or make good decisions.
