\v 16 And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him
that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength.
\v 17 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in
me, neither was there breath left in me.
