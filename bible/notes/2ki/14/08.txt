\v 9 But King Jehoash replied this to King Amaziah: "Once a thornbush growing in \add the mountains\add* in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar tree, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son in order that he may marry her.' But a wild animal in Lebanon passed by the thornbush and trampled it.
\v 10 \add The meaning of what I am say is that\add* your army has defeated the army of Edom, so now you have become very proud. But you should be content with defeating the people of Edom, and allow your soldiers to stay at home. If you cause trouble \add by fighting against\add* us, you will surely \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* cause a disaster to happen to you and to your people."

\v 8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us look one another in the face."
\v 9 So Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah a parable, "The thistle that was in Lebanon sent a message to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son for a wife,' and there a wild beast that was in Lebanon walked by and trampled down the thistle."
\v 10 You have indeed attacked Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Glory in your victory, but stay at home, for why should
you cause yourself trouble and fall, both you and Judah with you?
