<usfm>
\v 15 \add Aaron must then go outside the Sacred Tent\add*and slaughter the goat to be an offering for the sins of the people. Then he must bring its blood into the Very Holy Place behind the curtain. There he must sprinkle \add some of\add* that blood on the lid of the sacred chest and against the front of the chest, like he did with the bull's blood.
\v 16 By doing that, he will purify the Very Holy Place. And he must sprinkle more of the blood on the Sacred Tent, because the tent is in the midst of the camp of the Israelite people who have become unacceptable to me \add because of their sins\add*.

\v 15 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the atonement lid, and before the atonement lid:
\v 16 and he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of meeting, that lives with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.
