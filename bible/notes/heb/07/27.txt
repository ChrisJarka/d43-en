\v 27 \add The Jewish\add* high priests need to sacrifice \add animals\add* day by day \add as well as year by year\add*. They do this, firstly, \add to atone\add* for their own sins, and then \add to atone for other\add* people \add who have sinned\add*. \add But because Jesus never sinned\add*, he does not need to do that. The only thing \add he needed to do to save people\add* was to sacrifice himself once!
\v 28 \add We need a high priest like\add* him, because \add Moses\add* wrote in the laws \add that God gave him\add* \f + \ft personification \f* that the ones who would be appointed to be priests would be men who tended \add to sin easily\add*. But \add God\add* solemnly \add declared\add* \f + \ft personification \f* after \add he had given\add* his laws \add to Moses\add* that \add he would appoint\add* his Son\f + \ft Or: the man who is also God \f* \add to be a high priest. Now\add* \add his Son\f + \ft Or: the man who is also God\add* \f* has forever become all that God intends him to be.

\v 27 who does not need, like those high priests, to daily offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people.  He did this once for all, when he offered up himself.
\v 28 For the law appoints men with weaknesses as high priests, but the word of the oath, which was after the law, appointed a Son, made perfect forever.
