====== Jeremiah 23 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Prophesying lies ==

The false prophets had encouraged people to continue sinning by saying everything will be alright. 


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Word play ==

In Hebrew the word for "message" can also mean "burden." In translations that are using footnote, you may want to explain the word play in a footnote. In translations that are not using footnotes or which will primarily be distributed in an oral form, you may need a sentence like "What message has the Lord burdened you with now?" or "You (plural) call God's message a heavy burden on you."
