  * **A third ... Another third ... the other third** - "One-third ... Another one-third ... the other one-third" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_ordinal]])
  * **will be guards at the doors** - "will be guards at the temple doors"
  * **the Foundation Gate** - This gate may have also been called the "Middle Gate" or the "Sur Gate." It was apparently an inner gate that was near the king's palace.
  * **All the people** - This is an exaggeration to express that there will be many people in the courtyard. AT: "Many people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
