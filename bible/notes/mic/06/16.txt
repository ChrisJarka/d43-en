===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The statutes of Omri have been kept **  - The Bible says two important things about Omri, First, He is who built the capital city of Isreal called Samaria. Secondly, the Bible says" he walked in the way of Jeraboamâ€¦ and in the sins tha he made Israel to sin."
  * **You walk by their advice **  - "their" refers to the family line of Omri and Ahab. God is speaking of generational sin that Israel has been following. AT: You have followed the family of Omri and his son Ahab.
  * ** So I will make you, city, a ruin, you inhabitants a mockery, and you will bear the scorn of my people ** . - AT: This city shall be a ruin, its inhabitants a mockery, and scorn will cover them both.
