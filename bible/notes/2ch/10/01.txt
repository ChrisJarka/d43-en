===== translationNotes: =====

  * **all Israel was coming** - Here "Israel" ​is a metonym for the men of Israel. The word "all" is a generalization. AT: "the men of Israel were coming"​ (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **It happened that** - This phrase is used here to mark where the action starts. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **Jeroboam ... Nebat** - These are the names of men. See how you translated these names in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:09:29|9:29]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **he had fled from the presence of King Solomon** - "he had fled from king Solomon"
