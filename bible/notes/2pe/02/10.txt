===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 He will punish especially severely those who do what they themselves want to do, things that make them displeasing to God. They boldly do whatever they wish to do; they even insult God's powerful angels.
\v 11 Unlike those people, God's angels insult no one in front of him, not even them!

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 This is especially true for those who continue in the corrupt desires of the flesh and despise authority. They are bold and self-willed. They are not afraid to blaspheme the glorious ones.
\v 11 Angels have greater strength and ability than all men, but they do not bring not insulting judgments against them to the Lord.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **flesh**  -in the Old Testament denotes (1) a particular part of the body of man and animals (Ge 2:21;41:2;Ps 102:5); (2) the whole body (Ps 16:9); (3) all living things that have flesh, and mostly humanity as a whole (Ge 6:12,13); (4) weakness (2Ch 32:8; comp. Isa 31:3;Ps 78:39). It suggests the idea of softness in "heart of flesh" (Eze 11:19). Relationship is denoted in the expression "my flesh and bone" (Jdg 9:2;Isa 58:7).

In the New Testament, it speaks of that which is opposed to the "Spirit" (Ro 6:19;Mt 16:17). Being "in the flesh" describes those who do not belong to God, who cannot please God and whose sinful passions bring death  (Ro 7:5;8:8,9), and to live "according to the flesh" is to live and act sinfully (Ro 8:4,5,7,12).
