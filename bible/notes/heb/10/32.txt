\p
\v 32 But carefully remember the former days, after you were enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings;
\v 33 partly, being exposed to public contempt both by abuses and afflictions; and partly, being joined together with those who were so treated.
\v 34 For you had compassion on those who were in prison, and you joyfully took the spoiling of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an eternal one.
