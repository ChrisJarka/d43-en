\c 6
\d For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 O Jehovah, rebuke me not in your anger,
\q Neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.
\q
\v 2 Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away:
\q O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled.
\q
\v 3 My soul also is sore troubled:
\q And thou, O Jehovah, how long?
\q
\v 4 Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul:
\q Save me for your lovingkindnessâ€™ sake.
\q
\v 5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee:
\q In Sheol who shall give you thanks?
\q
\v 6 I am weary with my groaning;
\q Every night make I my bed to swim;
\q I water my couch with my tears.
\q
\v 7 Mine eye wastes away because of grief;
\q It waxes old because of all mine adversaries.
\q
\v 8 Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity;
\q For Jehovah has heard the voice of my weeping.
\q
\v 9 Jehovah has heard my supplication;
\q Jehovah will receive my prayer.
\q
\v 10 All mine enemies shall be put to shame and sore troubled:
\q They shall turn back, they shall be put to shame suddenly.
