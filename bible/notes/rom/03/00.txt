Since chapter 2 explained that all Jews are condemned because they violated the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]] and that Gentiles could be saved. Chapter three answers the question: then what advantage does the Jew have?

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Universal Condemnation ==

This chapter explains that the whole world is without excuse and has enough knowledge to seek after and believe in the true God, Yahweh. [[:en:obe:kt:sin|Sin]] is a problem for all of mankind and enslaves the unbeliever in their sin. This refutes the common understanding that "all people are basically good."

== "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God" ==
The standard required for entrance into heaven and being capable of being in the presence of God is perfection. Anything less than perfect leads to condemnation.

== The purpose of the law of Moses ==
Obedience to the law cannot [[:en:obe:kt:justify|justify]] a person. The law does not justify a person but is a way that a person displays their faith in God. It is faith which has always justified a person.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
The are frequently used in this chapter. It appears the intent of these [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] is to make the reader feel guilty or to convict them in their  sin and ultimately bring them to faith in Jesus.
