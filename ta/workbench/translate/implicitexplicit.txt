====== Explicit and Implicit Information ======


//This page answers the question: What are explicit information, implicit information, and background knowledge?// 

There are two types of written and spoken communication, explicit and implicit information.

  * **Explicit information** is what the speaker states clearly.
  * **Implicit information** is what the speaker not state clearly because he expects his audience to be able to learn it from what he does say.

The speaker also expects his audience to know some things already and to think about them in order to understand the information he is giving them. This is **background knowledge.**
==== Description ====

When someone speaks or writes, he has something specific that he wants people to know. He normally states this clearly. This is **explicit information**.

The speaker assumes that his audience already knows certain things that they will think about in order to understand his message. Normally he does not tell people these things, although what he says may remind them about those things they know. This is **old knowledge**. 

The speaker does not always state clearly every bit of information that he expects his speaker to understand from what he says. Information that the speaker expects people to learn from what he says even though he does not state it clearly is implicit **information.**

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>Then a scribe came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." Jesus said to him, "Foxes __have holes__, and the birds of the sky __have nests__, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."  (Matthew 8:20 ULB)

Jesus did not say what foxes and birds use holes and nests for, because he expected that the scribe would have known that foxes sleep in holes in the ground and birds sleep in their nests. This is **old knowledge**. Jesus did not say here "I am the Son of Man" but, if the scribe did not already know it, then that fact would be **implicit information** - something that the scribe could learn from what Jesus said. Jesus did not state explicitly that  he travelled a lot and did not have a house that he slept in every night. That is **implicit information** that the scribe could learn from Jesus saying that he had nowhere to lay his head.

> Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But it will be more tolerable for __Tyre and Sidon__ at the day of judgment than for you.  (Matthew 11:21, 22 ULB)

The people of Tyre and Sidon were very wicked, and the day of judgment is a time when God will judge every person. This is implicit information that the people that Jesus was speaking to would have thought about in order to understand what he was saying. And even though the people he was speaking to had seen his mighty deeds, they had not repented. So they would be judged more severely than the people of Tyre and Sidon would be judged. This is implicit information that Jesus wanted them to learn from what he said. 

>Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not wash their hands when they eat__. (Matthew 15:2 ULB)

One of the traditions of the elders was a ceremony in which people would wash their hands in order to be ritually clean before eating. People thought that in order to be righteous, they had to follow all the traditions of the elders. This was implicit information that the Pharisees who were speaking to Jesus expected him to know. They were rebuking him because his disciples did not follow the traditions. This is implicit information that they wanted him to understand from what they said.
