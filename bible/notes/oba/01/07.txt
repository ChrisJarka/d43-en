===== Translation Notes: =====

Obadiah's prophecy has just told Edom in a word picture that others had stolen his treasures.

  * **There is no understanding in him** - Here, "him" refers to those who humble Edom.
  * **understanding** - "reason" or "wisdom"
  * **understanding out of the mountain of Esau? - **  Obadiah is not really expecting an answer here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
  * **mountain of Esau** - The "mountain of Esau" is another way to say the "land of Edom." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **your mighty men will be dismayed, Teman** - "Teman" was a descendant of Esau. This is just another way to refer to the people of Edom.
  * **cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter** -
