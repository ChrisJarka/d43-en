=== What is the Book of 2 Corinthians about? ===

The Corinthian church was fractured into factions and groups (see 1 Corinthians), each defending their own point of view. The church in Corinth was not mature. But these believers were not idolaters (as was common in the city of Corinth), but they did not live their lives by the principles of the gospel of Christ. Some opposed Paul outright. Others were not enthusiastic about Paul, or were indifferent to his message.
 
Paul wrote to them about these issues:  Do not associate with immoral people (1 Cor. 5:9); he addressed the danger of different groups associating with particular leaders, (1 Cor. 1:15-16); the church had received others who also had claimed to be apostles (1 Cor. 11); and, finally, the “severe letter” dealing with the leader of the opposition to his gospel (2:3-9; 7:8-12).
 
Paul’s relationship with the Corinth church extended over several years. They were caught up in their culture and could not keep in focus the all-important place Christ must have in their lives. Paul labored for their “restoration” (13:9) that they might be “built up and not torn down” (13:10) when he came to them.

=== Who wrote the Book of 2 Corinthians? ===

2 Corinthians was written by the Apostle Paul around AD 55-56.  This is the second of two letters we have that Paul wrote to the church in Corinth. Corinthians was probably written when Paul was in Macedonia (2:13). Corinth was a major trading center, and with 200,000 people (and about 500,000 more people who were slaves living in the city). It was a thriving city. In ancient times it was commonly described as “wealthy” or “prosperous.”
