====== 1 Corinthians 02:1-2 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 My fellow believers, when I came to you, I proclaimed to you the message that God had revealed to me. But I did not proclaim it using eloquent words that would make people think highly of me, nor did I argue in a way that unbelievers would think was very wise.
\v 2 I did that because I decided that I would speak only about Jesus Christ. Specifically, I told you  \add what he accomplished for us when\add* he was killed by being nailed \f + \ft Or:\add when they\add* killed him by nailing him \f* to a cross.

\v 1 When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come with eloquent words or with worldly wisdom, when I told you about the witness God gave you about himself.
\v 2 I made a crucial decision, when I came to you, not to talk about anything other than Jesus Christ and his work on the cross, he was Lord and Christ crucified.
