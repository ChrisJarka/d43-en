== "To preach the kingdom of God" ==
There is some controversy among scholars about whether the kingdom of God here refers to the reign of God on earth or the gospel message (Jesus died for the sins of man). It is best to translate this as "to preach about the kingdom of God" or "to teach them about how God was going to show himself as king" (UDB). It is best not to treat it as a metaphor for the gospel because it is unnecessary here.
