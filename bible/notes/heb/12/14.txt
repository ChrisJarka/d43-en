\v 14 Try to live peacefully with all people. Seek to be holy, since no one will see the Lord if he is not holy.
\v 15 Beware that none of you stops \add trusting in\add* God, \add who has done kind things for us that we did not deserve\add* \f + \ft Or: Beware that you have never \add experienced\add* God kindly \add saving you\add* \f*. Be on guard lest any of you \add act evilly towards others\add*, because that will \add grow like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a root \add grows into a big plant\add*, and the result \add of your\add* doing that will be that many believers will sin and become unacceptable to God.
\v 16 Do not let anyone be immoral, or be irreligious as Esau was. He exchanged the rights he had as a firstborn son for only one meal.
\v 17 You know that after he did that, he wanted to receive \add what his father would promise to give him if\add* he blessed him. But \add his father\add* refused \add to do what he requested\add*. And Esau found no way to change what he had done, even though he sought tearfully to do that.

\v 14 Follow after peace with all men, and the holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.
\v 15 Carefully see that no man falls short of the grace of God; and that no root of bitterness springs up to trouble you, and polute many others;
\v 16 so there won't be any sexually immature or ungodly person  such as Esau, who for one meal of meat sold his own birthright.
\v 17 For you know that afterwards when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; because he found no opportunity for repentance with his father, even though he sought it diligently with tears.
