\v 6 I was \add the first one who preached God's message to you. I was like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* someone who plants seeds. \add Later\add*, Apollos \add taught you more of God's message. That was like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* someone who waters plants \add after they start to grow\add*. But it is God who \add enables people to grow spiritually, just like he is the one who\add* causes \add plants\add* to grow.
\v 7 So \add the person who first preaches God's message to people is not important, and the person who later teaches people more of God's message is not important, just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* it is not the person who plants \add the seeds\add* or the person who waters \add the plants\add* who is important. Instead, it is God, who causes plants to grow\add and who causes people to grow spiritually, who is important\add*.

\v 6 I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
\v 7 So then neither is he that plants anything, neither he that waters; but God that gives the increase.
