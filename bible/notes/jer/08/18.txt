===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah and Yahweh have a conversation about the people of Judah. 

  * **My sorrow has no end** - The word "my" refers to Jeremiah. The original text is unclear and is interpreted here in different ways by modern versions.
  * **has no end** - This is an exaggeration meant to express the great extent of Jeremiah's sorrow. AT: "is very great" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]) 
  * **and my heart is sick** - Here "heart" represents Jeremiah's feelings and emotions. AT: "I feel sick deep down inside me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Behold!** - This alerts the reader to pay attention to what follows. "Pay attention!"
  * **the daughter of my people** - Jeremiah is speaking about the people of Judah in a way that shows his affection for them, as if for a daughter. AT: "my dear people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **from a far distant land** - Possible meanings are 1) From exile. AT: "from exile in a distant land" or 2) From throughout the land of Judah. AT: "throughout our land" (UDB)
  * **Is not Yahweh in Zion? Or is not her king in her?** - Jeremiah tells what the people of Judah are saying. The two parallel questions show that the people of Judah are wondering why Yahweh is not saving them. AT: "Why does Yahweh not save us if he is the king in Zion?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Why then would they offend me with their carved figures?** - The word "me" refers to Yahweh. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "If they want me to save them, then they must not offend me with their carved figures." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
