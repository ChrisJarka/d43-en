====== Ellipsis ======

The ellipsis is a punctuation mark and literary device that depicts a pause in the flow of a sentence. An ellipsis is indicated with three dots in a row (e.g. ...) and may occur in the beginning, middle or and of a sentence.  An ellipsis may show a literal pause, as in "John thought...and thought some more."  It may also indicate an incomplete thought at the end of a sentence, as in "John wanted to pick up the phone, but...."  Such a use requires the reader to think and feel as they read; the reader must determine 'why' there is a pause.

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Finally, an ellipsis may indicate a portion of information the author feels is non-essential has been left out of the sentence.  Typically, this use refers to</font> implicity<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>information, see:</font> <font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>(</font> [[:en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]]<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>) but may also be to focus the reader's attention on a specific aspect of the sentence.  This is common with quotes.  Consider this quote:  "Ten missionaries, originally from India and Bangladesh visited the station with news of great revival in the  Sudan."  It would be a reasonable use of an ellipsis to write:  "Ten missionaries...visited the station with news of great revival in the Sudan."</font>

===== Examples from English =====

In the following sentence: //John can play the guitar, and Mary can, too//. The action that Mary does has been omitted. The complete sentence would be: //John can play the guitar, and Mary can **play the guitar**, too.//
===== Examples from the Bible =====

Luke 21:10 - //Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom."// fully stated would be: //Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom **will rise** against kingdom."//
