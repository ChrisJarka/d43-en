\v 14 When you have come to the land that Yahweh your God gives you possess it and live in it, and then say, "I will set a king over myself, like all the nations that are round about me,"
\v 15 then you must surely set as king over you one whom Yahweh your God will chooseâ€”one from among your brothers must you set as king over yourself; you may not put a foreigner, who is not your brother, over yourself.
