\v 4 \add I will explain why it is important to do that. Some\add* people have at one time fully understood \add the message about Christ\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. They have experienced \add a relationship with Jesus Christ\add* that God [EUP\f + \ft Or: MTY \f*] gave \add to them\add*. They have received the Holy Spirit the same as \add others have\add*.
\v 5 They have experienced that God's message is good. And by what they have experienced \add now\add*, they know how \add God will work\add* powerfully in the future. If those people reject \add the message about Christ\add*, it will not be possible for anyone to persuade them to turn away from their sinful behavior again!
\v 6 What those \add believers who later renounce the message about Christ do is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* they themselves are nailing the Son of God to a cross again! They are causing others to publicly despise Christ.

\v 4 I will explain why it is important to do that. Some people have at one time understood the message about Christ. They have publicly believed the heavenly gift of Jesus Christ and received the Holy Spirit with others.
\v 5 They have experienced that God's message is good, and by what they have seen now they know God will work powerfully in the future.
\v 6 If those people reject the message about Christ, it will not be possible for anyone to persuade them to turn away from their sinful behavior again! What those believers who later renounce the message about Christ do is as though they themselves are nailing the Son of God to a cross again! They are causing others to publicly despise Christ.

\v 4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who were sharers of the Holy Spirit,
\v 5 and who tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,
\v 6 and who then fell awayâ€”it is impossible to restore them again to repentance; because they crucified in themselves the very Son of God again, and making him an object of public ridicule.
