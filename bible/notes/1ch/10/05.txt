===== translationNotes: =====

  * **fell on his sword** - He probably stuck the handle into the ground and leaned on the point so the sword would go through his body as he fell down. The action is a metonym for the result, death. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:10:04|10:4]]. AT: "killed himself with his sword" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **his three sons** - You may need to supply the words omitted by the ellipsis. AT: "his 3 sons died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
