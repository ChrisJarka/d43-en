\v 12 However, there will be a time when Yahweh will gather them together again; \add he will separate them from the people who have conquered them, like people\add* separate wheat from chaff. He will bring them \add back to Israel\add*, one by one, from \add the land between\add* the Euphrates River in the northeast and the brook at the border of Egypt in the southwest.
\v 13 At that time, a trumpet will be blown very loudly. And those who were exiled to Assyria and Egypt and who almost died there will return to Jerusalem, to worship Yahweh on \add Zion\add*, his holy hill.

\v 12 In that day, Yahweh will shake the tree
from the Euphrates River to the Wadi of Egypt, and you will be gathered one by one, O 
Israelites
\v 13 In that day a great trumpet will be blown; and the ones lost in the land of Assyria will come,
 and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and they will worship Yahweh on the holy mountain
in Jerusalem.
