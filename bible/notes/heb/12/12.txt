\v 12 So, instead of acting as though you were spiritually tired out, trust God's discipline to renew you.
\v 13 Go straight forward following Christ so that believers who are weak in trusting Christ will gain strength from you and not leave God's way. Instead, they will be spiritually restored as an injured and useless limb is restored.

===== Translation Notes: =====

The comparison of followers of Jesus to runners of a race continues. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

    * **lift up your hands that hang down and make your weak knees strong again**  - Hanging hands and week knees represent someone who is tired while running. A person who faces challenges in life is compared to a tired runner who will not give up. AT: "strengthen yourself like a racer strengthens his body when he is determined to finish a race"
    * **make straight paths for your feet**  - Focusing on future goals is compared to a runner planning his course. AT: "Determine what you need to do like a runner will determine the best way to get to the finish line"
    * **whoever is lame**  - A person who is discouraged is compared to a person who cannot stand or run. AT: "whoever wants to quit" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **will not be led astray** - The phrase "led astray" means to be led off of the correct path.  A person who does the wrong thing is compared to a runner who follows the wrong path. AT: "will not decide to do things that are easy but don't honor God"
    * **rather be healed** - A discouraged person who has been given hope is compared to a lame person who is healed.  This is a picture of spiritually strengthening followers of Jesus.
