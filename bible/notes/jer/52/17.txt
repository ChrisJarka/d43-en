\v 17 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
\v 18 The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith
they ministered, took they away.
\v 19 And the cups, and the firepans, and the basins, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the bowls—that
which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver,—the captain of the guard took away.
