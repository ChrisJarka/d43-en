  * [[:en:obe:kt:beloved]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Arise** - "Get up"
  * **my love** - "you whom I love." See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:09|1:9]].
  * **Look** - "Listen carefully" or "What I am about to say is important." You could use a word in your language that tells the hearer to listen carefully.
  * **the winter is past; the rain is over and gone** - In winter it is too cold and wet to make love outside, but the cold, wet time has passed.
  * **the winter is past** - Winter is the cold time of year when plants do not grow and people prefer to stay inside their houses. You could use the term in your language for that time of year.
  * **the rain is over and gone** - In Israel, it only rains during the winter. The rain here is cold and unpleasant, not the refreshing rain of the hot season.
