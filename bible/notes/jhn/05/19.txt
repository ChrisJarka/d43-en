\v 20 \add My\add* Father loves me, and he shows me everything that he is doing. He will show me \add the miracles\add* that \add he wants me to do\add* that will be greater than the ones that \add you have already seen me do\add*, so that you may be amazed.

\v 19 Jesus replied to them, "I promise this is the truth: The Son of Man can do nothing on his own authority. He can do only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, that is what the Son does.
\v 20 The Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. And greater works than these the Father will show him, so that you may see what he can do and be amazed, and know who he is.

\v 19 Jesus answered them, "I tell you the solemn  truth.  The Son can do nothing of himself, except  only what
he sees the Father doing, for whatever the Father  is doing, the Son does these things also.
\v 20 For the Father loves the Son, and he  is showing him everything  that he himself does,  and he will show
him greater things than these, that you will be amazed.
