=== What is the Book of Nehemiah about? ===

The Book of Nehemiah is about rebuilding the city wall of Jerusalem. It is also about restoring the Jewish people's faithfulness to Yahweh. 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

The Book of Nehemiah is named for Nehemiah, a Jew who served as an official under King Artaxerxes. Translators might choose to make the title clearer, for example, “The book about Nehemiah.”

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Why were Israelites not allowed to marry people from other nations? ===

Yahweh knew that marry foreign wives would cause the people of Israel to worship other [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]].

=== What hardships did the returning Jews experience in Judah? ===

The returning Jews were in economic hardship. They had to begin farming again in ruined fields, and they were surrounded by other ethnic groups of people who were not completely happy that the Jews had returned. In addition, many Jewish men decided to marry women from those other ethnic groups. The result was a mixing of the worship of Yahweh with the worship of pagan idols.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How does the Book of Nehemiah use the term "Israel"? === 

The Book of Nehemiah uses the term “Israel” to refer to the kingdom of Judah, which was composed mostly of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The other ten tribes had ended their loyalty to any kings descended from David. After sinking into idolatry and corruption, they had been conquered by the Assyrian Empire, taken away, and entirely absorbed into other ethnic groups.

=== Do the events in the Book of Nehemiah proceed in chronological order? ===

Parts of Nehemiah do not follow a strict chronological sequence. Translators should pay attention to notes that signal when events are probably out of order with each other.
