\v 31 Then Jesus began to teach them, "\add Even though\add* I am the one who came from heaven, it is necessary that I suffer very much. It is also necessary that I be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws \f + \ft Or:that the elders, the chief priests, and the men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws reject me \f*, and that I be killed \f + \ft Or:they kill me \f*. But on the third day \add after I am killed I\add* will become alive again."
\v 32 He said this to them clearly. But Peter took Jesus aside and then, \add because he assumed that the Messiah would never die\add*, he started to rebuke Jesus \add for talking about dying\add*.

\v 32 He said this to them clearly. But Peter took Jesus aside and started to scold him for talking this way.
