====== Creating Authoritative Translations ======

Being AUTHORITATIVE when translating the Bible is: Using reliable sources, determine the order of events, either logically or according to time. If they differ from the order in which they were presented in the original, rearrange them in your language to best communicate the meaning intended in the original language.
