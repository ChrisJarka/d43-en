\v 19 Those who ran after us were faster than eagles flying in the sky.

\q1
\v 20 Our king, whom Yahweh had appointed,
\q2 the one who enabled us to live,
\q1 the one whom we trusted to protect us
\q2 when we had to live in the other nations as slaves—
\q1 the enemy captured him,
\q2 as you would capture an animal in a pit.

\q
\v 19 Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles in the sky.
\q They chased us to the mountains and lay in wait for us in the wilderness.
\q
\v 20 The breath in our nostrils—Yahweh's anointed one—he was the one who was captured in their pits;
\q of whom it was said, "Under his shadow we will live among the nations."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles in the sky** - The author compares the speed of their pursuers to the speed of eagles flying. Eagles fly very quickly to catch other animals. AT: "Those who were chasing us were faster than eagles" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
  * **lay in wait for us** - "waited to attack us"
  * **The breath in our nostrils** - This phrase refers to the king. He is spoken of as if he were breath; the breath keeps the body alive, and the king keeps his people alive by ruling them well and protecting them from their enemies. AT: "The one who is like breath in our nostrils" or "The one who protects our lives" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh's anointed one** - Here being "anointed" represents being the king. God had told people to anoint whomever he had chosen to be king. AT: "the one whom Yahweh had chosen to be anointed as king" or "the king Yahweh chose" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he was the one who was captured in their pits** - Here "pits" refers to the enemies' plans to capture him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "he was the one whom our enemies captured by their plans" or "our enemies made plans to capture our king, and they did capture him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **of whom it was said** - This phrase with the quote following it gives us more information about the king. The quote shows what the people had hoped the king would do for them before he was trapped. It can be expressed in active form. AT: "even though we had said about him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Under his shadow we will live among the nations** - Here "his shadow" represents him protecting them. AT: "Under his protection we will live among the nations" or "Though we may have to live in other nations, he will protect us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
