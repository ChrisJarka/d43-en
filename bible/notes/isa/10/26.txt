<usfm>
\v 26 Then Yahweh of Hosts will wield a whip against them, like when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb. He will raise his rod over the sea and lift it up as he did in Egypt.
\v 27 In that day,
\q1 his burden is lifted from your shoulder and his yoke from off your neck, 
\q1 and the yoke will be destroyed because your neck will be too fat for it.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **will wield a whip against them** - God will not really use a whip. Isaiah uses "whip" to refer to God's power to punish the Assyrians. Alternate translation: "will turn his power against the people of Assyria." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **like when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb** - This refers to a event in the Old Testament when God helped a man named Gideon defeat an enemy army that attacked the people of Israel. (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]])
  * **He will raise his rod over the sea and lift it up as he did in Egypt** - This refers to an event in the Old Testament when God caused the water of the Red Sea to split so the people of Israel could escape from the army of Egypt. Alternate translation: "He will help you escape from the army of Assyria as he helped your ancestors escape the army of Egypt."
  * **In that day** - See how you translated the similar phrase in [[en:bible:notes:isa:02:09|2:11]].
  * **his burden is lifted from your shoulder and his yoke from off your neck** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. The words "burden" and "yoke" refer to slavery. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will remove the army of Assyria who oppresses and enslaves you." (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]] and [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **Aiath…Migron…Michmash…Geba…Ramah…Gibeah** - These are all cities and villages near Jerusalem that the army of Assyria passed through causing trouble in each of them. These all refer to the people who live in these places. (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]])
