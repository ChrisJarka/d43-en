\c 2
\s 1 Timothy 2:1-3:16
\sr I instruct you how people should conduct themselves who belong to God's family and who uphold the truth.
\p
\v 1 The first  thing that I urge  you to tell your congregation is that  Christians should continually ask  God for  what they need. They should also pray to God  for all other people, and they should be thanking  God. 
\v 2 Specifically, they should pray for rulers and for all  other people who are in important government positions, in order that  God will help them to rule. As God enables the rulers to rule well, we can live very peaceably as we conduct ours lives doing all that God and others consider to be right and proper. 
\v 3 It is good  to pray like that, and it pleases God, who saves us, when we pray like that. 
\v 4 He desires to save all people. He wants everyone to fully know  and accept his true  message. 
\v 5 He is the  only one  true God! And there is  only one person who talks to God on behalf of people. That person is Christ Jesus, who  himself is a man! 
\v 6 He gave his  life. 
\v 7 As for \bd me\bd*, he appointed me to declare  this message and to be an apostle. I am telling the truth  about God appointing me. I am not lying! He appointed me to teach the non-Jews that they should believe God's true message.
\p
\v 8 I desire that in every place  where believers worship, the men who pray publicly . 
\v 9  I would like that the clothing that women wear be modest and sensible. I want them to not fix their hair in fancy, Or: elaborate ways, nor wear gold  jewelry, nor pearls, nor expensive clothing  in order that they may make themselves attractive. 
\v 10 Instead, they should be doing things that women who claim to worship God should do; that is, they should be doing good deeds. 
\v 11 Women must learn to  listen quietly  during the worship services and to fully subject themselves  to the leaders of the congregation. 
\v 12 I do not permit women to teach  men spiritual truth publicly, and I do not permit them to have authority over men. Instead, I desire that women  listen quietly  during the worship services. 
\v 13 Keep in mind that God made Adam first, and afterwards he made Eve, 
\v 14 and that it was not Adam whom  Satan deceived. As a result of the woman being deceived, she sinned. She did what God had told her not to do. 
\v 15 But even though she did that, now women will be saved , and if they continue to be modest.
