====== Lord ======

===== Facts: =====

The term "Lord" refers to someone who has ownership or authority over people. When it is capitalized, it is a title that refers to God.

  * In the Old Testament, this term is used in references to God such as "Lord God Almighty" or "Lord Yahweh" or "Yahweh our Lord."
  * In the New Testament, the apostles used the expressions, "Lord Jesus" and "Lord Jesus Christ," which communicate that Jesus is God.


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Make sure it is clear that the name "Yahweh" in the Old Testament refers to the same God as the title "the Lord" in the New Testament.
  * Some languages would translate this term as "the Master" or some other term that communicates ownership or supreme ruler.
  * Many translations capitalize the first letter of this term to make it clear to the reader that this is referring to God.
