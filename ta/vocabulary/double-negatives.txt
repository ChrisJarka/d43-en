====== Double Negatives ======

Most languages express negation near the verb. Some languages can also express negation in a pronoun like “none,” “nothing,” and “no one,” or an adverb like “nowhere.” In English the following pairs of sentences mean the same thing.

  * “I do __not__ have any”  -- “I have __none__”
  * “I do __not__ want anything” -- “I want __nothing__”
  * “I did __not__ tell anyone" -- “I told __no one__”
  * “I did __not__ go anywhere” -- “I went __nowhere__"\\

In some languages people use both negatives. This is the other kind of double negative. Sometimes this is simply the normal way of expressing the negative, and sometimes it emphasizes the negative. The following Spanish sentence has both the word 'no' next to the verb and a negative pronoun that means “no one.” It means “I did not see anyone.”

  * “__No__ ví a __nadie__.”
  * I did __not__ see __no one__.”
Most of the time, a double negative statement is not the best way to express something. Double negatives can be vague.

For example: To say, "It is not unlikely" may mean "It is likely." or "It could happen."

There may be times when a vague statement is desired or preferred. An example might be "She was not unattractive."

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Titus 3:14**  //Our people must learn to engage themselves in good works that meet urgent needs so that they may not be unfruitful.//

**"So that they may not be unfruitful" **  is a double-negative. It could be stated positively: “so they will be fruitful” or “so they can produce fruit for God” or “so their lives will be useful.”

**Deuteronomy 8:11**  //Be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God, failing to observe his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day.//

===== Translation Suggestions =====

When translating a sentence that has “not” and a negative adjective such as “She was ____not un__//attractive,” you will need to understand why the sentence was made that way and translate it accordingly. “She was not unattractive” could mean simply “She was attractive” or it could mean “She was very attractive.”
When translating an English sentence that has “not” and a pronoun, or that has a negative pronoun like “none,” some languages may need to use both their word for “not” and their negative pronoun, as in the Spanish example above.
