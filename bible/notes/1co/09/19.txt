===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 I am not obligated to do what anyone else thinks that I should do. Nevertheless, when I have been with any group of people, I have made myself \add do what they believed that I should do, just like a slave does what his master wants him to do\add*. I have done that in order that I might convince more people \add to trust in Christ\add*.
\v 20 Specifically, when I was with fellow Jews, I did the things that Jews \add think that people should do\add*. I did that in order that I might convince some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*. Although I am now not obligated to obey the Jewish laws and rituals, when I was with those who believe that they are obligated to obey those laws, I did the things that they \add think that people should do\add*. I did that in order to convince some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*.

\v 19 For though I was free from all , I became a servant to all, that I might gain the more.
\v 20 And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law.
