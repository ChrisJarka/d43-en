====== Son of Man ======

===== Definition: =====

The title, "Son of Man" is best known for how Jesus used it to refer to himself. There are different interpretations regarding its meaning.

  * In the Old Testament, the phrase, "son of man" is often used to mean "man" or "human being."
  * God also used "son of man" many times to address the prophet Ezekiel as when he said, "…you, son of man, must prophesy…."
  * Jesus often used this term to refer to himself instead of saying "I" or "me." Some have said that during that time period, it was a modest way of referring to oneself.
  * The prophet Daniel saw a vision of a "son of man" coming with the clouds. Many interpret this to be a prophecy about the Messiah.
  * Jesus said that the Son of Man will be coming back someday on the clouds, which shows that he is God.
  * Many years after that, t<font 13.63636302948px line-height: 1.4;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>he apostle John</font> <font 13.63636302948px line-height: 17.8181819915772px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>saw a vision of a son of man sitting on the clouds.</font>
  * The title "Son of Man" emphasizes Jesus' humanity. While Jesus was fully God, he was also fully human.
  * When Jesus uses it, this phrase can be translated as, " the One who became a human being" or "the Man from heaven" or "the one who came from heaven." Some translators occasionally render it as "I, the Son of Man" to make it clear that Jesus is talking about himself.
  * Check to make sure the translation of this term does not give the wrong meaning.
