=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

This chapter starts off with a number of rhetorical questions. All of them are asked one upon another until the last one, which provides some answer. Yahweh certainly spoken through his prophets. So listen to them.  These rhetorical questions all expect No as an answer because they are things we do not expect to happen. The writer is preparing the reader to conclude that God truly does use the prophets to speak His message.
