\v 8 because formerly you \add did not know God's truth\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add as those who\add* are in darkness \add do not know what is around them\add*. But now \add it is as though\add* you are in the light \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add because you know God's truth\add* because of your relationship with the Lord \add Jesus\add*. So do those things that those who know God's truth \f + \ft metaphor \f* should do.
\v 9 Keep in mind that \add as\add* light \f + \ft metaphor \f* produces \add things that are good, those who know God's truth should do those things\add* that are good, righteous, and honest.
\v 10 And as \add you do that\add*, try to find out\f + \ft Or: to discover \f* what pleases the Lord.
\v 11 Do not do the worthless deeds that the people who are in \add spiritual\add* darkness\f + \ft Or: who do not know God's truth \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f* do. Instead, let others know that those people's deeds are worthless.
\v 12 It is shameful for God's people to even talk \add among themselves about\add* those evil deeds that evil people do secretly and habitually.

\v 8 For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light
\v 9 (for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),
\v 10 proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord;
\v 11 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;
\v 12 for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.
