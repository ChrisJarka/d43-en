====== astray, go astray, led astray ======

===== Definition: =====

To go astray or be led astray is to walk away from the path set by Jesus.

  * Jesus said that the road to heaven is narrow, and there are very few people who find it.
  * In a broader sense, it is also to walk into situations contrary to wisdom, as in Proverbs where a young man walks by the house of the adulteress and is enticed by her.  It also carries the connotation of being deceived, as in being lead astray by false doctrine.
