\v 17 Then the man brought me to the temple's outer courtyard. There I saw some rooms, and a stone pavement in the courtyard. There were thirty rooms facing the courtyard.
\v 18 The stone pavement was all around the courtyard, and it extended out from the walls into the courtyard for the same distance as the gate entrances. That was the lower pavement.
\v 19 Then the man measured the distance across the outer courtyard of the temple, between the outer gate and inner courtyard; it was about fifty-four meters on the east side, and the same distance on the north side of the courtyard.

\v 17 Then the man brought me to the outer court of the temple. Behold, there were rooms, and there was pavement in the court, with thirty rooms next to the pavement.
\v 18 The pavement went up to the side of the gates, and its width was the same as the gates' length. This was the lower pavement.
\v 19 Then the man measured the distance from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner gate; it was one hundred cubits on the east side, and the same on the north side.
