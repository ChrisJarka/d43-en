====== Translator Qualifications ======

The primary questions that the community leaders should ask about the translator are:

Q? Is the translator recognized as a qualified local language speaker? (Has the translator been living in the local community for much of their life? Do people respect the way this person speaks?)

Q? Does the translator(s) have adequate national language skills? (Would they be asked to translate for a national language speaker to help the community members who do not understand the national language well?)

Q? Is the translator respected in the community as a follower of Christ? (How has this person shown themselves to be committed to Christ as a disciple? Can the fruit of God's Holy Spirit be seen in this person's life?)
