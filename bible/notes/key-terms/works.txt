====== works ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible the term works is used to describe a person's deeds and actions.

  * The works that a person performs can be either good or evil.
  * A believer's works are intended to reflect Jesus' character, and Christians will be rewarded for the works that they do. The works of believers will demonstrate that they have been redeemed by their Savior.
  * The works of non-believers will be evaluated on the judgment day and they will give an account to God for their works. Their works will fall short of the glory of God and will be the basis for eternal condemnation.
