====== Hosea 11 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter continues using the poetic form to communicate about Yahweh's relationship to Israel, the Northern Kingdom. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

This is an extended metaphor of Israel as a make child in care of Yahweh, his parent. 

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

There are rhetorical questions used by Yahweh to show his disappointment and anger at Israel's persistent rejection of their God.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

In verse 10, Yahweh is portrayed as a lion. This seems opposite to the intent of Yahweh's calling.
