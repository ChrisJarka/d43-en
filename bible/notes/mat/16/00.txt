======  Matthew 16 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Bread ==

Bread is a special image in 16:5-12. Jesus used his disciples' discussion about bread to warn them against the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. He spoke of these teachings as if they were yeast, the ingredient that causes bread to rise before it is baked.

At the same time, the mention of bread in this chapter is meant to remind the readers that Jesus fed the five thousand with bread (see 14:13-21) and also the four thousand (see 15:29-39).

used the forgetting of the bread to instruct the disciples. Bread reminds the readers of Jesus' feeding of the 5000 and the provision of God giving manna in the desert. Leaven, used in making bread, is always used as a negative image. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

[[:en:bible:notes:mat:16:21|16:21]] forms a break in the narrative. Matthew narrates or gives a comment about this story from the future. It is possible to put this type of information into parentheses, but in most languages, context enables the reader to understand. 

== Paradox ==

This is a statement that  seems absurd or appears to contradict itself. For example, "whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it" ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:16:24|16:24-28]])
