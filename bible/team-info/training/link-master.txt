====== Key Terms: Link and Page Master ======
**note:** This page and job description has been revised to current procedures (8Jan15).


===== Procedures =====

  - The Key Term Link and Page Master (LPM) will handle the hyperlink and page creation as necessary.
  - Creation of pages will normally be tagged as "create" following the template specified on this page. See templates.
  - Each week "create" tagged key term pages will be promoted to "draft" as those pages are needed to support the Notes Teams efforts.
  - It is up to the KT team leader to promote pages from "draft"  to "publish"
  - At "publish" stage, a check will be made to create all x-ref hyperlinks and remove the "ktlink" tag.

==== Pagename naming conventions ====

The key term pagename naming convention is:
  * for a single word, the url-name is lower case.
  * for a multi-word phrase, the url-name is the words without spaces, hyphens, or other breaks (ex: kingdomofJudah).

The display name of the x-ref links for the KT will be the default Key Term Header title.

The link will use the URL name of the term. 
   See https://www.door43.org/en/bible/admin-reports/00-key-term-and-tag-names


==== Create KT Pages as Needed ====

When KT's on the Notes page are not found in the [[https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/key-terms/01-kt-list|https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/key-terms/01-kt-list]], new pages must be created. The URL name for the new KT page should in the following format:

<code>
https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/key-terms/urlname
</code>

For one-word KT's, the word will become the URL name. If the term is a multi-word phrase, the words will be run together without spaces, hyphens, or other breaks, as with existing terms.

There are two kinds of KT pagesâ€“one for terms that require definition, and the other for proper names that requires facts.

The draft code for a "term" KT page is:

<code>
====== term ======
