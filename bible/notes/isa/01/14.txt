Also, God is very angry and refers to himself with the phrase "my soul" which is the part that has emotions. It can be translated "I hate all your celebrations of the new moon and the other festivals." (See: [[en:ta:translate:synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **they are a burden to me; I am tired of enduring them** - This compares how God feels about the people's celebrations to  carrying a heavy object.  It can be translated as “They are a heavy load that I am tired of carrying.” (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **I hide my eyes from you** - This is a way of saying "I will not look at you" or "I will not pay attention to you." (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]]).
  * **your hands are full of blood** - Possible meanings of are 1) the blood refers to the sacrifices that God considers worthless or 2) the blood refers to the guilt caused by the lack of justice towards the weak described in 1:16-17.
