Here is the original of Daniel 4:28-29 (ASV):

28 **All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.**  ** 29 At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,  **

And here is how the two verses were combined to make the meaning more clear:

** 28-29 ** **All these things happened to king Nebuchadnezzar in twelve months. He was walking at the royal palace in Babylon.  **
