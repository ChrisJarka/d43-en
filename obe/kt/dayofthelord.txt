====== day of the Lord, day of Yahweh ======

===== Description: =====

The Old Testament term "day of Yahweh" is used to refer to specific times when God would punish his people or his enemies for their sin. 

  * The New Testament term "day of the Lord" refers more specifically to the day or time when the Lord Jesus will come back to judge people.
  * Sometimes "day of Yahweh" is used to refer to times when Yahweh would intervene to rescue his people from their enemies.
  * Other times this phrase is used to prophesy about some future judgment or punishment that Yahweh would bring to his people. In some contexts it also may refer to the time of final judgment.
  * The word "day" in this phrase can sometimes refer to a "time" or "occasion" that is longer than 24 hours.
  * The term "day of the Lord" in the New Testament also refers more to the time when there will be a final judgment of all who have rebelled against Yahweh and rejected Christ. The term "Lord" probably refers to the "Lord Jesus" in many of these contexts. Sometimes "Lord" could refer more generally to Yahweh God.
  * When "day of the Lord" refers to the final, future time of judgment and resurrection, it is also known as the "last day". This time will begin when the Lord Jesus comes back to judge sinners and will continue until his rule over all creation is permanently established.
