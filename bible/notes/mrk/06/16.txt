\v 16 Having heard \add what the people were saying, King\add* Herod \add Antipas\add* himself repeatedly said, "The man \add performing those miracles\add* must be John! I \add commanded my soldiers to\add* cut off his head, but he has become alive again \add to get revenge for my killing him\add*!"
\v 17 The reason \add King Herod concluded that John wanted revenge is as follows: Some time before this\add*, Herod married Herodias, while she was \add still\add* the wife of his \add younger\add* brother, Philip.
\v 18 John kept telling Herod, "\add God's\add* law does not permit you to marry the wife of your brother \add while he is still alive\add*." Then, because Herodias \add urged him to put John in prison\add*, Herod himself sent \add soldiers to John\add*. They seized John and put him in prison.
\v 19 But because Herodias wanted to get \add further\add* revenge on John, she wanted \add someone\add* to execute him. But she could not do that because \add while John was in prison\add*, Herod kept John safe \add from her\add*.
\v 20 Herod did this because he respected\f + \ft Or: feared \f* John, because he knew that he was a righteous and holy man. The king did not know what he should do, but he liked to listen to him.

\v 17 Some time before this, Herod married Herodias, although she was the wife of his brother, Philip.
\v 18 John kept telling Herod, "God's law does not permit you to marry the wife of your brother while he is still alive." Then, because Herodias urged him to put John in prison, Herod himself sent soldiers to John. They arrested John and put him in prison.
\v 19 But because Herodias wanted to get further revenge on John, she wanted someone to execute him. But she could not do that because while John was in prison, Herod kept John safe from her.
\v 20 Herod did this because he was afraid of John, because he knew that he was a righteous man who devoted himself to God. The king was disturbed by him and did not know what he should do with him, but he liked to listen to him.

\v 16 But Herod heard this he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised."
\v 17 For Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison, because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because Herod had married her.
\v 18 For John told Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brotherâ€™s wife."
\v 19 Herodias set herself against John and wanted to kill him. But she could not,
\v 20 for Herod feared John, and he knew that he was a righteous and holy man. So Herod tried to keep him safe. When he heard John preach, his message upset him, and yet he was still glad to hear him.
