\v 4 Always rejoice for the Lord Jesus! I say again, rejoice!
\v 5 All people must see that you are gentle because the Lord is near.
\v 6 Do not worry about anything. Instead, in every situation pray to God, tell him exactly what you need, and ask him to help you. And thank God for all he does for you.
\v 7 Then God's peace, which is much greater than we can understand it, will be like a soldier that is guarding how you feel and how you think, as we are joined to Christ Jesus.
