===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Mary continues to praise God:)
    * **He has pulled down rulers from their thrones**  - This could be translated as, "He has taken away the authority of kings" or, "He has made rulers stop ruling". A throne is a chair that a king sits on, and it is a symbol of his authority. If a king is brought down from his throne, it means he no longer has the authority to reign as king.
    * **has raised up lowly people**  - In this metaphor, people who are important are higher than people who are less important. If your language does not have this kind of metaphor, you could translate this as "has made humble people important" or "has given honor to people whom others have not honored." (See [[:en:ta:figures of speech:metaphor|Metaphor]])
    * **plenty of good things**  - This can also be translated here as, "plenty of good food."
    * **without anything**  - This can also be translated as, "without giving them anything" or, "empty-handed."
