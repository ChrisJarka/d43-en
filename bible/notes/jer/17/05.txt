\q
\v 5 Thus says Yahweh: The vigorous man who trusts in mankind is accursed; 
\q He makes flesh his strength but turns his heart from Yahweh!
\q 
\v 6 For he will be like a cypress tree in the Arabah and will not see that good is coming;
\q So he will abide in the stony places of the desert, a barren land without inhabitants.
