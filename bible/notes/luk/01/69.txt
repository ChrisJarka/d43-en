===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **his servant David** - AT: "King David, who served him"
  * **as he spoke** - "just as God said"
  * **spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets** - When God spoke through the prophets, they used their own voices, but God enabled them to speak the words he wanted them to speak.  AT: "caused his holy prophets to say." 
  * **from our enemies...from the hand of all who hate us** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are repeated for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **and from the hand** - AT: "and salvation from the hand" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
  * **hand** - "power" or "control." The word "hand" is associated with the power or control that is being used to harm God's people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
