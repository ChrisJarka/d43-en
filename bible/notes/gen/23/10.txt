===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a change from the story to information about Ephron.
  * **Ephron** - This is the man who owned the cave that Abraham wanted to buy.
  * **sons of Heth** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:23:03|23:3]]
  * **in the hearing of the sons of Heth**  - This can be translated as "in the presence of the sons of Heth" or "while the sons of Heth listened" or "in their hearing."
  * **of all those who enter the gate of his city**  - "all those who had gathered at the gate of his city." The city gate was where the leaders of the city would meet to make important decisions.
  * **his city** - "Ephron's city." This phrase shows that Ephron belonged to that city. It does not mean that he owned it. It can also be translated as "the city."
  * **give**  - This can also be translated as "sell." Ephron may have used the word "give" so that he would sound generous, but Abraham would have understood that Ephron meant "sell."
  * **in the presence of the sons of my people**  - "in the sight of the sons of my people" or "while my people watch"
  * **I give it to you to bury your dead**  - "I give it to you. Bury your dead."
