\v 21 It was certainly\add because of\add* what our \add revered\add* ancestor Abraham did, when he \add prepared to\add* sacrifice his son Isaac, that he was considered \add by God\add* \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* considered him \f* to be a righteous, \add obedient\add* person.\f + \ft Or: Was it not \add because of\add* what our \add revered\add* ancestor Abraham did, when he \add prepared to\add* sacrifice his son Isaac, that he was considered \add by God\add* \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* considered him \f* to be a righteous, \add obedient\add* person? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 22 You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* can realize that he was not only trusting \add in God\add*, but he was also doing \add what God told him to do\add*, and \add you\f + \ft singular \f* can realize\add* that he was able to trust \add in God more\add* completely because of having done \add what God told him to do\add*.
\v 23 And \add so it happened as it is written in the\add* Scriptures: 'Because Abraham truly trusted in God, he was considered \add by God\add* to be \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* considered that he was \f* righteous.' And \add God also\add* said \add about Abraham\add*, "He is my friend."
\v 24 \add From the example of Abraham\add*, you can realize that it is because people do good deeds that \add God\add* considers them to be righteous, and not only because they trust \add in him\add*.

\v 21 We all honor Abraham, our ancestor. He tried to obey what God told him to do--he tried to give his son Isaac to God on the altar. God considered Abraham to be a righteous person for trying to obey him.
\v 22 In this way, Abraham trusted in God and obeyed him. When he obeyed him, he finished doing what he was trusting God for.
\v 23 And so it happened as it is written in the Scriptures, "Because Abraham truly trusted in God, God viewed him as someone who did the right thing." God also said about Abraham, "He is my friend."
\v 24 From the example of Abraham you can realize that it is because people do good deeds that God considers them to be righteous, and not only because they trust in him.

\v 21 Was not Abraham our patriarch justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?
\v 22 You see that faith worked with his actions, and by works his faith achieved its purpose.
\v 23 The scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." So Abraham was called a friend of God.
\v 24 You see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.
