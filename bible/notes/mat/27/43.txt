===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of the crucifixion and death of Jesus.

  * **he said, 'I am the Son of God.'** - Jesus publicly called himself the Son of God, even though men persecuted him because of that. His title "Son of God" needs to be maintained in the translation to honor the Lord Jesus. 
  * **And the robbers who were crucified with him** - "And the robbers that the soldiers had crucified with Jesus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
