{{:en:obs:obs-09-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:god|God]]** said, “I have seen the **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:suffer|suffering]] of my people**. I will send you to **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** so that you can **bring the [[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:israel|Israelites]] out of their [[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:servant|slavery]] in [[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]**. I will give them the land of **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]**, the land I **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:promise|promised]]** to **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:abraham|Abraham]]**, **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:isaac|Isaac]]**, and **[[:en:obs:notes:key-terms:jacob|Jacob]]**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **suffering of my people** - This could be translated as, “the very harsh treatment that my people are experiencing. Some languages might translate this as, “how the Egyptians are giving my people terrible pain.” 
  * **my people** - This refers to the Israelites. God had made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants that He would bless them and make them into a great nation. Through this covenant, the Israelites became God's own people.
  * **bring … out of their slavery in Egypt** - This can be translated as, “set them free from being slaves in Egypt” or, “bring them out of Egypt where they are now slaves.”
