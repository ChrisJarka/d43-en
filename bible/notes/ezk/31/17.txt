===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

  * **they also went down with him to Sheol** - "Those trees of Lebanon also died and went down to Sheol with the cedar." 
  * **to the ones** - This can be translated as "and they were with those."
  * **who had been killed by the sword** - Alternate translation: "whom enemies had killed with swords" or whom they had killed with the sword. (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **These were his strong arm** - "These trees of Lebanon were the strong arm of the cedar." The phrase "strong arm" means "power." Alternate translation: "These trees of Lebanon were the power of the cedar."
  * **Which of these trees in Eden was your equal in glory and greatness?** - "Which of these trees in Eden had as much glory and was as great as you were?" God asks Pharaoh this question to show him that the parable applies to him and his country. It can start with "So Pharaoh" or "So Egypt."   (See"  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **For you will be brought down** – Alternate translation: "For I will bring you down."
  * **with the trees of Eden** - This can be translated as "like the other trees of Eden."
  * **to the lowest parts of the earth** - "to a place deep in the ground"
  * **among the uncircumcised** – This can be translated as "where you will be with people who are not circumcised."
  * **you will dwell with those slain by the sword** – This can be translated as "you will lie down with people who have been killed with swords." After they die, people lie down in their grave.
  * **This is Pharaoh and all of his entourage** - This can be translated as "I am talking about Pharaoh and his people."
  * **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11|5:11]].
