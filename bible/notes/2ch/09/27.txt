===== translationNotes: =====

  * **as much as the stones on the ground** - This is an exaggeration to emphasize that there was such a great amount of silver. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **They brought horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all the lands** - The word "they" may refer to Solomon's merchants. However this sentence is not about what the merchants did, but about where Solomon's horses came from. AT: "Horses were brought to Solomon from Egypt and from all the lands" or "Solomon's horses were from Egypt and all the lands"
  * **from all the lands** - The word "all" is a generalization. AT: "from many other places" or "from many other countries" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
