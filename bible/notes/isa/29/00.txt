====== Isaiah 29 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of chapter 29, which is an extended quotation.

This chapter begins a series of "woes" against specific nations. This chapter presents judgements against the kingdoms of Ephraim and eventually Judah. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:woe]] and [[:en:obe:kt:judge]])

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Ariel ==
This is another name for Jerusalem. It is an uncommon name. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== End times prophecies ==
It appears that some aspects of this prophecy are still to be fulfilled in the last day before or when Yahweh reigns on earth in Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]], [[:en:obe:kt:fulfill]] and [[:en:obe:kt:lastday]])
