===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 2-5 Yahweh had told Moses many years previously in what way he wanted the division of the land to be decided. Moses had already declared that two and a half tribes would be allotted land on the east side of the Jordan \add River\add*. Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. \add Half of the tribe descended from Manasseh was allotted land on the east side of the Jordan, along with the tribes of Reuben and Gad\add*. The people belonging to the nine and a half other tribes \add on the west side of the Jordan River\add* threw lots\f + \ft Or: stones that had been marked \f* to decide which land each tribe would receive. The tribe of Levi was not allotted any land. They received only towns \add that already existed\add*, towns in which to live, and pastures\f + \ft Or: fields of grass \f* for their animals.

\v 3 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two and one-half tribes before Israel crossed on the Jordan River. But to the Levites he gave no inheritance because they were treated differently because of their priestly duties.
\v 4 For the people of Joseph were divided into two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And no portion of the land was given to the Levites, but they were given cities in which to live, including pasturelands for their livestock so they could sustain their families.
\v 5 The people of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses, so they gave out portions of the land as an inheritance.
