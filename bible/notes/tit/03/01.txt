===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 And Titus, a few more things I want to say. Be sure to remind our people that, as much as possible, we should comply with the rules and laws that govern our society. That way government officials will be more likely to allow us to do our works of charity.
\v 2 And of course, we should try not to say bad things about any one or to argue with people. It is good to let other people have their preferences instead of us pushing to get our own way. Humility is spiritual power.
