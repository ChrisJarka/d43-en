\v 3-4 The reason \add Herod thought that was this: Herod had married\add* Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, \add while Philip was still living. So\add* John had been saying to him, "\add What\add* you \add did by\add* marrying \add your brother's wife while your brother is still alive is against God's\add* law!" Then, to \add please\add* Herodias, Herod \add told his soldiers\add* to arrest John. They bound him with chains and put him in prison.
\v 5 Herod wanted to have John executed, but he was afraid that the people \add who had accepted what John taught would riot if he did that\add*, because they believed that John was a prophet.

\v 3-4 This is what happened to make Herod think this. Herod had married Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, while Philip was still living. So John kept saying to him, "What you have done is against God's law!" Then, to please Herodias, Herod told his soldiers to arrest John. They bound him with chains and put him in prison.
\v 5 Herod wanted to order his men to execute John, but he was afraid of the general public, because they believed that John was a prophet speaking for God.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of how Herod killed John the Baptist.

  * **Herod had laid hold upon John, bound him, and put him in prison**  - Most likely, Herod did not do these actions personally but had ordered soldiers or other persons in authority do these actions for him (see UDB). Your translation may have a need to reflect this.
  * **Herod had laid hold upon John**  - "Herod had arrested John"
  * **because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife**  - Herod had married Herodias, who had previously been the wife of his brother Philip (see UDB).
  * **his brother Philip's wife**  - "the wife of his brother Philip" or "who had been the wife of his brother Philip"
  * **For John had said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her as your wife" **- This can be expressed in indirect discourse if necessary: "For John had said to him that it was not lawful for him to have her as his wife." (See: Direct or Indirect)
  * **For John had said to him**  - "For John had said to Herod"
  * **It is not lawful**  - It would have been a violation of the Jewish Old Testament law for a man and his brother both to have the same wife, even if not at the same time.
  * **had said to him**  - This can be translated "had been saying to him" or "had repeatedly said to him" to indicate that John had spoken to Herod more than once and perhaps many times (see UDB).
  * **for you to have her as your wife**  - "for you to be married to her"
  * **because they regarded him as a prophet**  - The Jewish people believed John was a prophet speaking for God (see UDB).
  * **regarded him as**  - "considered him to be"
