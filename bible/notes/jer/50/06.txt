\v 6 My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the
mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place.
\v 7 All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against
Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.
