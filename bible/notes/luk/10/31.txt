===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues telling his story.)
    * **by chance a certain priest** - This could also be translated as "by coincidence a certain priest" or, "It just so happened that a priest."  This was not something that the man had planned. But it gives the audience the hope that someone might help the hurting man.
    * **was going down that way** - That is, "was walking down along that road."
    * **and when he saw him** - That is, "and when the priest saw the injured man." This could also be translated as "but when he saw him."
    * **passed by on the other side**  - That is, "he passed by on the other side of the road from where the man was lying."
   * **Levite**  - Levites were of the same tribal caste as the priests, but were not of the right family descent to serve as priests. They often served as temple attendants but could not offer the sacrifices. In India, a comparable person might be someone from the Brahman caste who is not a priest.
     * **And similarly a Levite also**  - That is, "And in the same way, a Levite also was walking down that way."
