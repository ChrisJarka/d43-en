\v 29 "You men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees are hypocrites! Your punishment will be terrible! You rebuild the tombs of the \add prophets whom others killed long ago\add*. You decorate the monuments \add that honor\add* righteous \add people\add*.
\v 30 You say, 'If we had \add lived\add* when our ancestors \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add lived\add*, we would not have helped \f + \ft metaphor \f* those who killed \f + \ft metonymy \f* the prophets.'
\v 31 Thus \add you recognize that you should honor the prophets, but you disregard the word of God that other men whom God has sent teach you. In that way\add* you testify against yourselves that you are descendants and disciples \f + \ft metaphor \f* of those who killed the prophets.

\v 29 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you build the sepulchres of the prophets, and garnish the tombs of
the righteous,
\v 30 and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
prophets.
\v 31 Wherefore you witness to yourselves, that you are sons of them that killed the prophets.
