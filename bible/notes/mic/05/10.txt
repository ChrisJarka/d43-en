  * [[:en:obe:kt:yahweh|Yahweh]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:horse|horse]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:chariot|chariot]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * ** "It will happen in that day" ** - a future event, a day to be waited on.
  * ** I will destroy your horses among you, and will demolish your chariots ** - Israel was expressly commanded not to return to Egypt to obtain Horses, so the use of Horses and Chariots for the purpose of war, would likewise be inappropriate. God would be his peopleâ€™s protection. (see:  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
