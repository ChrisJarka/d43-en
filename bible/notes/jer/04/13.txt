<usfm>
\v 13 See, he is attacking like clouds, and his chariots are like a storm. His horses are faster than eagles. Woe to us, for we will be devastated!
\v 14 Cleanse your heart from wickedness, Jerusalem, so that you might be saved. How long will your deepest thoughts be about how to sin?
\v 15 For a voice is bringing news from Dan, and the coming disaster is heard from the mountains of Ephraim.
