===== Identify Figures of Speech =====

When writing a note to identify and explain a figure of speech, use sentence form and put the meaning in quotes.

  * **Make ready the way of the Lord**  - This phrase compares people preparing themselves for the arrival of the Lord to people who are repairing a road for someone to use it. AT: "Repent and be ready for when the Lord comes." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **You offspring of poisonous snakes**  - Jesus uses this expression to emphasize how dangerous the Pharisees are. Poisonous snakes are dangerous and represent evil. AT: "You evil poisonous snakes!" or "You are evil like poisonous snakes." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])

If there is a Translation Academy page that deals with a figure of speech, you can include it in the note. You can see the list of topics at: [[en:ta:ta-topics]]

  * Refer to tA topics by writing, for example, "(See: Metonymy)" or "(See: Exclusive)" at the end of the note. You can see these at [[:en:ta:ta-topics|Topics]].
