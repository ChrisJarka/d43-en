====== Jeremiah 23:37-40 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 This is what you should ask each prophet: 'What did Yahweh reply \add when you talked to him\add*? What is he saying to us?'
\v 38 If he replies, '\add What I told you\add* is a prophecy\f + \ft Or: message \f* from Yahweh,' you should say to him, 'You have continued to say, "I received a prophecy\f + \ft Or: message \f* from Yahweh" even though I told you to not claim that you have received prophecies\f + \ft Or: messages \f* from Yahweh.'
\v 39 So I, Yahweh, will get rid of you \add false prophets\add*. I will expel you from my presence. And I will get rid of this city that I gave to you and to your ancestors.
\v 40 I will cause people to make fun of you forever. People will never forget that you were disgraced."

\v 37 This is what you should ask each prophet: 'What did Yahweh reply when you talked to him? What is he saying to us?'
\v 38 If he replies, 'What I told you is a prophecy from Yahweh' then let him know I will punish him, becasue I told my true prophets not to give any messages to this people right now.
\v 39 So I, Yahweh, will get rid of you false prophets. I will expel you from my presence. And I will get rid of this city that I gave to you and to your ancestors.
\v 40 I will cause people to make fun of you forever. People will never forget that you were disgraced."

\v 37 This is what you will say to the prophet, 'What answer did Yahweh give you? or 'What did Yahweh say?' 
\v 38 But if you say, 'The burden of Yahweh', this is what Yahweh says: 
\q 'Because you have said these words, 'The burden of Yahweh,' when I sent to you, saying, 'You will not say, "The burden of Yahweh,"'
\q
\v 39 therefore, behold, I am about to pick you up and throw you away from me, along with the city that I gave you and your ancestors.
\q
\v 40 Then I will put everlasting shame and insult on you that will not be forgotten.'"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh completes his message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:09|23:9]].
  * **General Information:** - In verses 33-40 there is a wordplay with the word "burden." Sometimes it means "a message" and other times it means "a heavy load to carry." This wordplay should be retained if possible. 

  * **This is what you will say** - Here "you" is singular and refers to Jeremiah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **But if you say ... Because you have said ... when I sent to you ... You will not say ... pick you up ... throw you ... I gave you ... insult on you** - All of these instance of "you" are plural and refer to the priests and false prophets. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
  * **Therefore, see** - This alerts the reader to pay special attention to what follows. AT: "So pay attention"
  * **I am about to pick you up and throw you away from me** - Yahweh speaks of sending these priests and false prophets into exile as they were an object that he was going to throw far away. AT: "I am about to drive you away from me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the city that I gave you** - this refers to Jerusalem
  * **I will put everlasting shame and insult on you that will not be forgotten** - Yahweh speaks of the humiliation of the priests and false prophets as if he would put shame and insult on them like clothing.

People will never forget that you were disgraced" (UDB)  
  * **that will not be forgotten** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "that will last forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
