\v 10 And thou, son of man, say to the house of Israel: Thus you speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us,
and we pine away in them; how then can we live?
\v 11 Say to them, As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn
from his way and live: turn you, turn you from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?
