\v 13 Some of your people's corpses will lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hilltop and on all the mountaintops, under every big tree —at all the places where they burned incense to honor their idols. When this happens you will realize that I, Yahweh, have done this.
\v 14 For I will stretch out my arm and cause every area in which they live in your country to become an empty wasteland, from the desert in the far south to Diblah town in the far north. Then they will realize that I, Yahweh, have the power to do the things that I say that I will do.'"

\v 13 Then you will know that I am Yahweh, when their dead are in your midst, their idols surrounding their altars on every high hill, on all the mountain peaks,
and under every flourishing tree and thick oak--the places where they offered soothing fragrances to all their idols!
\v 14 I will strike them with my hand and make the land desolate and a waste, from the wilderness to Diblah, throughout all their dwelling places.
Then they will know that I am Yahweh!"
