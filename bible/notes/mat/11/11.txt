\v 11 Verily I say to you, Among them that are born of women there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: yet he
that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
\v 12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by
force.
