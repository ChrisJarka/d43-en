\v 22 While King Ahaz was experiencing those troubles, he disobeyed Yahweh even more.
\v 23 He offered sacrifices to the gods that were worshiped in Damascus, whose \add army\add* had defeated his \add army\add*. He thought, "The gods that are worshiped by the kings of Syria have helped them, so I will offer sacrifices to those gods in order that they will help me." But worshiping those gods caused Ahaz and all of Israel to be ruined.

\v 22 This same King Ahaz sinned even more against Yahweh in his time of suffering.
\v 23 For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, gods that had defeated him. He said, "Because the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to them, so that they might help me." But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **in his time of suffering** - "when he was suffering"
  * **the gods of Damascus** - The Syrians believed Damascus to be the city where their gods dwelt, much like Yahweh dwelt in Jerusalem. AT: "the gods whom the Syrians worshiped in Damascus" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **gods that had defeated him** - This expresses Ahaz's opinion. Because the Syrians had defeated him and his army, Ahaz attributed his defeat to the gods whom the Syrians worshiped. AT: "gods whom he believed had enabled the Syrian army to defeat him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **they were the ruin of him and of all Israel** - The word "ruin" can be translated with a verb. AT: "those gods ruined him and all Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **all Israel** - Here "Israel" represents the southern kingdom of Judah.
