\v 20 And Moses said to them, If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before Jehovah to the war,
\v 21 and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Jehovah, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,
\v 22 and the land is subdued before Jehovah; then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless towards Jehovah, and towards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Jehovah.
