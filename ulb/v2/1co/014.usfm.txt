\c 14
\p
\v 1 Follow after love; yout desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.
\v 2 For he that speaks in a tongue speaks not to men, but to God; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit he
speaks mysteries.
\v 3 But he that prophesieth speaks to men edification, and exhortation, and consolation.
\v 4 He that speaks in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
\v 5 Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that you should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than
he that speaks with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
\v 6 But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way
of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?
\v 7 Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it
be known what is piped or harped?
\v 8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?
\v 9 So also you, unless you utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for you will
be speaking into the air.
\v 10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no
kind is without signification.
\v 11 If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks will be a
barbarian to me.
\v 12 So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the edifying of the church.
\v 13 Wherefore let him that speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
\v 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
\v 15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit,
and I will sing with the understanding also.
\v 16 Else if you bless with the spirit, how shall he that fills the place of the unlearned say the Amen at your giving of
thanks, seeing he knows not what you sayest?
\v 17 For you verily give thanks well, but the other is not edified.
\v 18 I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all:
\v 19 howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten
thousand words in a tongue.
\p
\v 20 Brethren, be not children in mind: yout in malice be you babes, but in mind be men.
\v 21 In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak to this people; and not
even thus will they hear me, says the Lord.
\v 22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying
is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.
\v 23 If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or
unbelieving, will they not say that you are mad?
\v 24 But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;
\v 25 the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is
among you indeed.
\p
\v 26 What is it then, brethren? When you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a
tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.
\v 27 If any man speaks in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and
that in turn; and let one interpret:
\v 28 but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
\v 29 And let the prophets speak by two or three, and let the others discern.
\v 30 But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.
\v 31 For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;
\v 32 and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;
\v 33 for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.
\p As in all the churches of the saints,
\v 34 let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as
also says the law.
\v 35 And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the
church.
\v 36 What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it to you alone?
\p
\v 37 If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write to you,
that they are the commandment of the Lord.
\v 38 But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
\p
\v 39 Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
\v 40 But let all things be done decently and in order.
