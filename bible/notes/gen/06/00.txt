====== General notes about Genesis 6 ======


**Formatting in this chapter**\\

Beginning in 6:22, the author starts giving summary statements about events that he repeatedly tells about in the following text. If the summary statements and the following repetitions are not carefully translated, readers can believe that the same events happened twice or three times instead of once. So translators should be careful not to give that impression.
