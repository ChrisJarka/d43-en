=== What is the Book of Acts about? ===

The Book of Acts tells the story of how the Holy Spirit guided and helped the early Christians, enabling them to begin to fulfill the Great Commission that Jesus had given the apostles in Matthew 28:19–20. As such, the book describes the growth of the church for about thirty years after Jesus’ ascension into heaven. It shows the power of God, the Holy Spirit, at work in the early church. 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "The Acts of the Apostles." Some have called this book “The Acts of the Holy Spirit” because the coming of the Spirit of God into the lives of God’s people marked the beginning of the church. But translators may choose another title such as "The Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Acts? ===

This book does not give the reader the name of the author. Since early Christian times, however, it has generally been believed that the author was Luke because he is the only person who could be included in the passages using the word "we." Luke was a medical doctor; his way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile who was friendly to Judaism, but he was not a convert to Judaism. He was not an eyewitness to the ministry of Jesus, but he did see many of the events described in the Book of Acts.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What is the [[:en:obe:kt:church|Church]]? ===

The Book of Acts begins a new era in the religious history of mankind. God is no longer concerned with proper worship governed through the temple in Jerusalem. Instead, he also shifts his focus from the nation Israel to the church, which is all the believers in Christ. The remainder of the New Testament, after the Book of Acts, will now focus on righteous living by the Holy Spirit's power because of Christ's death and resurrection. 


===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Text-Question ===

Text-Answer

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Luke? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of more accurate manuscripts. The follow are the most significant issues in Luke:\\

  * "Then an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground." (22:43–44) 
  * "For he was required to release one prisoner during the feast." (23:17) (so noted in ULB)
  * "Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." (23:34)


Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to Luke's Gospel.
