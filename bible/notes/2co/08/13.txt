\v 13 I do not mean that \add you should give so much to help others that\add* you yourselves do not have what you need. No, what I want is that \add both you and others\add* will have what\add you need\add*.
\v 14 Right now, when you have more \add than you need\f + \ft Or: \add*plenty \f* and \add the believers in Judea\add* do not have enough\f + \ft Or: all that they need \f*, \add with your gift you will enable them to have enough. Maybe some day\add* when you do not have enough\f + \ft Or: all that you need \f* and they have more than they need, they will \add be able to\add* help you. Then everyone will have enough \f + \ft Or: In that way each will share alike \f*.
\v 15 \add If that happens, the result will be like it is written\add* \f + \ft Or:\add like someone, Or: Moses\add* wrote \f* \add in the Scriptures about the time when God provided manna for his people\add*,
\p If someone gathered a lot \add of manna\add*, he still did not have more than he needed, \add because he gave some to someone who did not have enough\add*. And those who gathered only a little \add manna\add* still had all that they needed \f + \ft litotes \f*, \add because others who gathered more than they needed gave some manna to them\add*.

\p If someone gathered a lot of manna, he still did not have more than he needed, because he gave some to someone who did not have enough. And those who gathered only a little manna still had all that they needed , because others who gathered more than they needed gave some manna to them.

\v 13 For this is not so that there would be relief for others and trouble for you but a balance;
\v 14 your present abundance to supply what they lack, so that their abundance also supply your needs; so that there may be balance,
\v 15 as it is written, "He that gathered much had nothing left over; and he that gathered little had no lack."
