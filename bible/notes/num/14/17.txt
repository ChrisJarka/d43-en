\v 17 So Yahweh, now show that you are very powerful. You said,
\v 18 'I do not quickly become angry; instead, I love people greatly, and I forgive people for having sinned and having disobeyed my laws. But I will always punish \f + \ft litotes \f* people who are guilty of doing what is wrong. When parents sin, I will punish them, but I will also punish their children and their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren and their great-great-grandchildren.'
\v 19 So, because you love people like that, forgive these people for the sins that they have committed, just like you have continued to forgive them ever since they left Egypt."

\v 17 And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as you have spoken, saying,
\v 18 Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.
\v 19 Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your lovingkindness, and according as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
