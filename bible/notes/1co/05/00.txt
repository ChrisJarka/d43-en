====== 1 Corinthians 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the line of 5:13, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.  

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Euphemisms ==

Paul uses [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_euphemism|euphemisms]] to describe sensitive topics. This chapter deals with [[:en:obe:kt:fornication|sexual immorality]] of one church member. To “hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh”, means to allow Satan to destroy his body.

== Metaphor ==
He uses an extensive comparison using many [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphors]]. Yeast represents [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]]. The loaf represents the whole congregation. The unleavened bread represents a pure life. The Passover represents the Christian life. So the whole passage means: Don’t you know that a little evil will affect the whole congregation. So clean yourselves from evil so you will all be good. Christ has been sacrificed for us; so let us be sincere and truthful and not wicked and behaving badly.
