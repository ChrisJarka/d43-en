=== What is The Book of Lamentations about? ===

This book expresses grief over the capture of the city of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in about 586 BC. The book is organized into five poems. In them the writer speaks of the people's sin and unfaithfulness to God that led to their destruction. However, he also remembers God's faithfulness for those who turn back to him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]], [[:en:obe:kt:unfaithful]] and [[:en:obe:kt:faith]])

=== Who wrote The Book of Lamentations? ===

The name of the author of Lamentations is not given in the text, but it became traditional to say that the author was Jeremiah. It is fitting that a lament was made over the fall and destruction Jerusalem.
The eyewitness nature of the laments seems to fit closely with The Book of Jeremiah. Certainly the serious and grieving tone of Jeremiah is carried into The Book of Lamentations, and there is nothing to suggest that Jeremiah was not the author. 

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may call the book "Poems of Sadness." If translators want to keep to the traditional view that the prophet Jeremiah wrote this book, they might decide on a title such as "The Sad Sayings of Jeremiah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Did God abandon Israel? ===

Jeremiah often uses the imagery of abandonment in Lamentations, but this does not mean that God had completely given up on Israel. He rejected Israel for a period of time as the special place where he would be present. However, God remained faithful to his covenant promises. 

While it was common in the ancient Neat East to think that a god might leave his city, he usually did so because he was too weak to defend it. In Lamentations, Yahweh abandons Jerusalem because of the people's sinfulness, not because of any weakness on his part. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod]])

=== What is a funeral song? ===

It is common for cultures to sing songs at a funeral or when someone has died. Depending on the culture, these songs can sound either happy or sad. Lamentations is somewhat reminiscent of a sad song sung at a funeral. Some have said that the rhythm of the poems in Hebrew makes the poems sound as if they are slow or sluggish, like a funeral procession. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What style of writing is Lamentations? ===

Lamentations is a collection of five poems. These laments may have been sung or chanted by the Jewish exiles living in captivity in Babylon, and also by those Jews who remained in Jerusalem after its conquest. In Chapters 1, 2, and 4, each line of the poem begins with a different Hebrew letter in alphabetical order. The third chapter repeats three lines with the same letter followed by the next three lines beginning with next letter in alphabetical order. 

=== Who are the woman and the man in Lamentations? ===

The author uses the image of an abandoned woman and a persecuted man to represent Judah and Jerusalem. This is a type of personification used the make the pain more understandable to the reader. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
