\q
\v 6 For this is even from Israel,
\q the workman made it,
\q and it is not God,
\q surely the calf of Samaria will be broken in pieces.
\q
\v 7 For they sow the wind,
\q and reap the whirlwind.
\q The standing grain has no heads,
\q it yields no flour.
\q If it does yield,
\q strangers will swallow it up.
