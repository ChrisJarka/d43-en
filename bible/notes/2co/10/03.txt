\v 3 \add Remember that\add* although I am \add human like everyone else\add* in the world, I do not fight \add against those who oppose me\add* in the way that people who are not believers fight those who oppose them.
\v 4 \add I will tell you what I mean by that: Just like soldiers use\add* various weapons \add to fight their enemies\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add I\add* \add fight against\f + \ft Or: oppose\add* \f* \add those who\add* oppose God's message, but I do it in a different way. I do not \add use human arguments and clever, Or: sweet talk\add*, like unbelievers do. Instead, \add I fight against my opponents\add* by the powerful means that God \add has given me\add*. With that power \add I destroy their arguments against God's message and against me, just like soldiers destroy\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the fortresses \add of their enemies\add*.

\v 3 For even though we live as human beings, we do not wage war by human rules.
\v 4 For the weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world.  But they have divine power to destroy strongholds. We bring to nothing misleading arguments
