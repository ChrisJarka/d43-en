===== Checking Level 2 – External Check =====

==== Definition of Checking Level 2 ====

  * The content has been comprehensively reviewed by at least three church leaders who are native speakers of the target language, and at least one of which understands well one of the languages in which the source text is available. The reviewers should not be related to, or otherwise closely connected with the translator (or translation team). Usually the reviewers will be pastors of church congregations.
  * The reviewers should be affiliated with Church networks that are in agreement with the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines. It is preferable for the reviewers to be from a representative sample of the denominations in the language.
  * As in Level 1, the translated content is compared to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines and the checkers assert that the translated content conforms to both.
  * //This implements the concept of a “testimony of two or three witnesses” in the checking process. //
Level Two checking will be done in two ways:

I. The translation will be checked by the community to make sure that it is clear, natural, and understandable.

II. The translation will be checked by a group of church leaders from the language community to make sure that it is accurate.

The purpose of level two checking is to verify that representative groups from the local population agree that the translation is a good one.
