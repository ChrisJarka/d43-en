\c 110
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Jehovah says to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand,
\q Until I make your enemies your footstool.
\q
\v 2 Jehovah will send forth the rod of your strength out of Zion:
\q Rule you in the midst of your enemies.
\q
\v 3 Your people offer themselves willingly
\q In the day of your power, in holy array:
\q Out of the womb of the morning
\q You have the dew of your youth.
\q
\v 4 Jehovah has sworn, and will not repent:
\q You are a priest for ever
\q After the order of Melchizedek.
\q
\v 5 The Lord at your right hand
\q Will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
\q
\v 6 He will judge among the nations,
\q He will fill the places with dead bodies;
\q He will strike through the head in many countries.
\q
\v 7 He will drink of the brook in the way:
\q Therefore will he lift up the head.
