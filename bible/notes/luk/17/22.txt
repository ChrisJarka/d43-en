\v 22 Jesus said to his disciples, "There will be a time when you will want to see me , the one who came from heaven, ruling powerfully. But you will not see that.
\v 23 Some people will say to you, 'Look, the Messiah is over there!' or they will say 'Look, he is here!' When they say that, do not believe them. Do not follow them to go see the Messiah.
\v 24 Because when the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, everyone can see it. Similarly  when I, the one who came from heaven, come back again, everyone will see me.

\v 22 And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.
\v 23 And they shall say to you, Look, there! Look, here! go not away dont go looking, nor follow after them:
\v 24 for as the lightning, when it shines out of the one part under the heaven, shines to the other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be in his day.
