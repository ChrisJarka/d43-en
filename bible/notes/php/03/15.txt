  * **Let us therefore, as many as are mature,**  - "I encourage all of us believers who are strong in the faith"
  * **to think like that.**  - "to think the same way." (UDB) Paul wants his fellow believers to have the same desires he listed in verses 10-11.
  * **And if you think differently about anything**  - 
  * **you**  - The pronoun "you" in verse 15 refers to believers who think differently or disagree with Paul. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou-plural]])
  * **God will also reveal that to you.**  - "God will also make it clear to you."
  * **Whatever the case,**  - Paul is finishing this section of his letter and emphasizing the main point. It could be translated as: "Just one more thing,"
  * **if we have reached this point, we must walk in an orderly fashion according to it.**  - "we must obey whatever truth we have received from God."
