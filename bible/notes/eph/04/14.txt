We will not allow people who teach \add what is false\add* and who scheme\f + \ft Or: try cleverly \f* to deceive, Or: influence us.
\v 15 Instead, by loving \add others\add* as we behave according to \add God's\add* truth \f + \ft Or: speak in a loving manner what is true \f*, we will become more and more like Christ in every way. He is the one \add who controls\f + \ft Or: guides \f* all his people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like a person's\add* head \add controls\f + \ft Or: guides \f* his\add* body.

\v 14 that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;
\v 15 but speaking truth in love, may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, even Christ;
\v 16 from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in due measure of each several part, makes the increase of the body to the building up of itself in love.
