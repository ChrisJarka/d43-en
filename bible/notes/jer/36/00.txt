====== Jeremiah 36 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

== Opposition to Jeremiah (Jeremiah 36-38) ==

Jeremiah wrote God's prophesies on a scroll but the king just burned it up. It is possible that this action was intended to be understood as representing the definitiveness of these prophecies. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])
