Structure and formatting


This is the end of the story of Solomon. (Chapters 1-11)
=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

God had told the people of Israel in Moses's law never to marry women from the heathen nations. But Solomon married many women from heathen countries. And the wisest man became a fool (see: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) as his wives persuaded him to worship foolish idols. God became angry and warned he would take away ten tribes from the kingdom of his son.
