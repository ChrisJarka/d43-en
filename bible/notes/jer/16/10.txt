\v 10 And it shall come to pass, when you shall show this people all these words, and they shall say to thee, Wherefore has
Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against
Jehovah our God?
\v 11 then shall you say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, says Jehovah, and have walked after other gods,
and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;
