\v 7 The king did not put Saul's grandson Mephibosheth into their hands, because of what he and \add Mephibosheth's father\add* Jonathan had solemnly promised to each other.
\v 8 Instead, he took Armoni and another man named Mephibosheth, the two sons that Saul's slave wife Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, had given birth to, and the five sons that Saul's daughter Merab had given birth to. Merab's husband was Adriel the son of a man named Barzillai from Meholah \add town\add*.
\v 9 David put these men into the hands of the men from Gibeon. Then they hanged those seven men on a hill where they worshiped Yahweh. They were all killed during the time of the year that the people started to harvest the barley.

\v 9 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Jehovah, and they fell
