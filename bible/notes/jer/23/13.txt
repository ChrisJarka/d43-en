====== Jeremiah 23:13-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Previously I saw that the prophets in Samaria were doing something that was wrong;
\q2 they were prophesying, saying that Baal \add gave them the messages that they were proclaiming\add*,
\q1 and they were deceiving my people.
\q1
\v 14 And now I have seen the prophets in Jerusalem doing terrible things.
\q2 They commit adultery
\q2 and habitually tell lies.
\q1 They encourage [IDI] evil people to continue to do evil things,
\q2 with the result that the people do not stop sinning.
\q1 Those prophets are as wicked as the people in Sodom and Gomorrah were.
\p
\v 15 So, this is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says about those \add false\add* prophets:
\q1 "I will give those prophets bitter things to eat
\q2 and poison to drink,
\q1 because it is because of them that this land is filled with \add people who do\add* wicked deeds."

\p
\v 13 And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
\v 14 In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they
strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that none does return from his wickedness: they are all of them become to me as Sodom,
and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
\v 15 Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them
drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.
