\c 20
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Jehovah answer you in the day of trouble;
\q The name of the God of Jacob set you up on high;
\q
\v 2 Send you help from the sanctuary,
\q And strengthen you out of Zion;
\q
\v 3 Remember all your offerings,
\q And accept your burnt-sacrifice; \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 Grant you your heartâ€™s desire,
\q And fulfil all your counsel.
\q
\v 5 We will triumph in your salvation,
\q And in the name of our God we will set up our banners:
\q Jehovah fulfil all your petitions.
\q
\v 6 Now know I that Jehovah saves his anointed;
\q He will answer him from his holy heaven
\q With the saving strength of his right hand.
\q
\v 7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses;
\q But we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God.
\q
\v 8 They are bowed down and fallen;
\q But we are risen, and stand upright.
\q
\v 9 Save, Jehovah:
\q Let the King answer us when we call.
