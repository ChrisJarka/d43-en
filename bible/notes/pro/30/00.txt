====== Proverbs 30 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapter 30 is a chapter in Proverbs attributed to Agur, who is a person otherwise unknown. 

== Agur ==

His full title is Agur Son of Jakeh. Agur comes from a Hebrew word that means gatherer and so some scholars believe this is not a real name but possibly a way of referring to Solomon as a gatherer of Proverbs. However, it is still prudent to simply use this as a name in your translation. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Parallelism ==

Proverbs are often written without any surrounding context and in two lines of text. Each line will have a certain relationship to the other line. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Many of the proverbs are stated as promises or commands but they are intended to be advice.  

== Three thing and four ==

From verses 15 through 32, the author uses a fun technique to explain some things. He says there are three things and even four and lists items that exemplify a feature like small and yet wise. The numbering is not meant to be so literal but as a memory device that introduces the items. 

== Themes ==

There are individual proverbs that run along common themes: wise vs foolish, lazy vs diligent, money, truth telling, wicked vs righteous, sluggard, pride vs humility, integrity vs crookedness etc.
