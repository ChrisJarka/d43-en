==== Description ====

A **sentence** is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. The basic types of sentences are:

  * **Declarative Sentence** or **Statement**  - These are mainly used to give information. '//This is a fact.//'
  * **Interrogative Sentence** or **Question**  - These are mainly used to ask for information. '//Do you know him?//'
  * **Exclamatory Sentence** or **Exclamation**  - These are mainly used to express a strong feeling. 'Ouch, that hurt!'
  * **Imperative Sentence**  - These are mainly used to make something happen, as in a command or instruction. '//Pick that up.//'

**Reasons this is a translation Issue**
  * These sentence types can also be used for other functions. Languages are different as to which sentence types can be use for each function. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * Languages have different ways of showing that a statement is an exclamation.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

The examples below show each of these types used for their main functions.

**Declarative Sentence** or **Statement** 

**Interrogative Sentence** or **Question**

**Exclamatory Sentence** or **Exclamation**

The word "Oh" is often used at the beginning of an exclamation.
>Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

Exclamations often are not full sentences with a subject and predicate. The exclamation below has only nouns and prepositions, but no verb.

>__O__ foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! (Luke 24:25 ULB)

Exclamations in English often have a question word such as "how" or "why"?

>__How__ unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

**Imperative Sentence** 

There are different kinds of imperative sentences: command, request, instruction, invitation,

With a command, the speaker uses his authority and tells someone to do something.
>Rise up, Balak, and hear. Listen to me, you son of Zippor. (Numbers 23:18 ULB)

With a request, the speaker uses politeness when telling someone that he wants him to do something.
>Give us today our daily bread.  (Matthew 6:11 ULB)

With an invitation, the speaker says uses politeness or friendliness to suggest that someone do something if he wants to do it.
>Come with us and we will do you good. (Numbers 10:29)

With an instruction, the speaker tells how to do something. 
>...but if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments. ... If you wish to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. (Matthew 19:17, 21 ULB)

Imperative sentences are usually spoken to the person or people who are expected to do something. Even though a speaker would call the person he is speaking to "you," many languages do not normally use the pronoun "you" in a command.

>I say to this one, '__Go__,' and he goes, and to another one, '__Come__,' and he comes, and to my servant, '__Do this__,' and he does it." (Matthew 8:9 ULB)


Some imperative sentences are not spoken to the person or thing that is expected to do something. In English these commands often start with "let" or "may."

>Whoever sends his wife away,__ let him give__ her a certificate of divorce. (Matthew 5:31 ULB)

Jesus said to the centurion, "Depart! As you have believed, so __may it be done__ for you." And the servant was healed at that very hour. (Matthew 8:13 ULB)
