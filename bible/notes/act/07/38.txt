\v 38 It was this man Moses who was among the Israelites who were together in the wilderness; he was with the angel who had spoken to him on Mount Sinai. It is Moses to whom God had the angel on Mount Sinai give him our laws, and he was the one who told our ancestors what the angel had said. He was the one who received from God words that tell us how to live eternally and passed them on to us.


\p
\v 39 However, our ancestors did not want to obey Moses. Instead, they rejected him as their leader and wanted to return to Egypt.
\v 40 So they told his older brother Aaron, 'Make idols for us who will be our gods to lead us. As for that fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him!'

\v 38 This is the man who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who had spoken to him on Mount Sinai; this is the man who was with our forefathers; this is the man who received living words to give to us;
\v 39 this is the man whom our forefathers refused to obey; they pushed him away from themselves, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt,
\v 40 when they said to Aaron, 'Make us gods that will lead us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of
Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'
