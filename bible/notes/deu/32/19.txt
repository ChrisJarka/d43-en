===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: Parallelism)

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

  * **I will hide my face from them**  - AT: "I will turn away from them" (See: Synecdoche)
  * **I will see what their end will be**  - AT: "I will seewhat becomes of them" Because of their rebellion, Yahweh would stop protecting them and see how they would succeed without that.
  * **perverse generation**  - morally and spiritually depraved
