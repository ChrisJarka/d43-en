\c 4
\p
\v 1 I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith you were called,
\v 2 with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
\v 3 giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
\v 4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling;
\v 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
\v 6 one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.
\v 7 But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
\v 8 Wherefore he saith,
\q When he ascended on high,
\q he led captivity captive,
\q And gave gifts to men.
\m
\v 9 (Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?
\v 10 He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)
\v 11 And he gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
\v 12 for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of ministering, to the building up of the body of Christ:
\v 13 till we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a fullgrown man, to the
measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
\v 14 that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of
men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;
\v 15 but speaking truth in love, may grow up in all things into him, who is the head,
even Christ;
\v 16 from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working
in due measure of each several part, makes the increase of the body to the building up of itself in love.
\p
\v 17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their
mind,
\v 18 being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because
of the hardening of their heart;
\v 19 who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
\v 20 But you did not so learn Christ;
\v 21 if so be that you heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:
\v 22 that you put away, as concerning your former manner of life, the old man, that waxes corrupt after the lusts of deceit;
\v 23 and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
\v 24 and put on the new man, that after God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.
\p
\v 25 Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak you truth each one with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.
\v 26 Be you angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
\v 27 neither give place to the devil.
\v 28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may
have whereof to give to him that has need.
\v 29 Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give
grace to them that hear.
\v 30 And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed to the day of redemption.
\v 31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you, with all malice:
\v 32 and be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you.
