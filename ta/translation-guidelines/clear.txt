====== Creating Clear Translations ======

To translate the Bible to be CLEAR means to: Evaluate your translation and make it clear.

  * For each pronoun, make it clear to whom or what it refers.
  * For each abstract noun or passive verb form, identify the one who does the action (subject) and the one or thing that has the action done to them/it (object).
  * Identify the implied participants of active verbs.
  * Determine the intended meaning of possessive constructions (for example, the love of God).

**Word for Word Substitution**  - Literal translations, or word for word substitution, is not the best choice for doing excellent translations because they look only at individual words in the text, result in awkward text, may contain improper grammar, and presents an unclear or wrong meaning in the target text.
