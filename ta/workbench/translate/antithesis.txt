====== zzz - DO NOT USE - Antithesis ======

Antithesis occurs when two words or ideas that are completely different from each other are used in the same sentence to make a contrast.

Antithesis is used to draw attention to something, to strengthen a point, or to make a phrase memorable.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

If you can translate the idea clearly while keeping the opposite forms in your language then do so. However, if it would be confusing, translate the text so that it performs the same function of catching the reader's attention and helping them remember the passage.

Translators also need to consider the target language's linguistic and cultural characteristics.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**[["I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill"]]** (Matt. 5:17 ULB)


**[["These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life.”]]**  (Matthew 25:46 ULB)


**[["For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord."]]** (Romans 6:23 ULB)

===== Examples from English =====

“That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” - Neil Armstrong

"We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools." - Martin Luther King, Jr.
