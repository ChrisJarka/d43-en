===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **went forth from** - See how you translated this in 1:12. “departed from Yahweh” or “left Yahweh's presence”.
    * **severe boils** - These are large, itching and painful blisters covering Job's entire body.
    * ** potshard to scrape himself** - A "potshard" is a piece of broken pottery. The scraping may be used to scratch the itching skin. Scraping the skin may also be a sign of grief. 
    * **sat in ashes** - This is a figure of speech... a polite term for where Job was. The broken pottery that is around him and the ashes where he is sitting show that Job is sitting on the town dump. (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
