\v 15 Brothers, I speak in human terms. Like an irrevocable human contract, no one voids it or adds to it, so also
\v 16 God spoke the promises to Abraham and to his special descendent. God did not say, "... to his descendents," referring to many, but instead to only one, "... to your descendent," who is Christ!
