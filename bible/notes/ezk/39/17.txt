\v 17 And thou, son of man, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Speak to the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field,
Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great
sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh and drink blood.
