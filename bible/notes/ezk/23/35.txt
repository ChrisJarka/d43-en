===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **and thrown me away behind your back** - This phrase describes Yahweh like trash that someone would throw away.  Yahweh is saying Oholibah does not care about him.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you will lift high and reveal** - The phrase "lift high" refers to lifting something so other people can see it easier.  Both of these phrases describe one action.  AT: "you will put on display" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Thus says the Lord Yahweh- ** See how you translated this in 5:5.
