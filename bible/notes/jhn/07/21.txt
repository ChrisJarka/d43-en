\v 21 Jesus replied to them, "Because I did a miracle \add of healing someone\add* on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f*, you are all shocked.
\v 22 Moses gave you \add a law that you must\add* circumcise \add the male children and that you must do that exactly seven days after they are born. Actually\add*, it was your ancestors, \add Abraham and Isaac and Jacob\add*, not Moses, who \add started that ritual\add*. But because of that law, you sometimes circumcise them on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f*, \add but that is working, too\add*!

\v 21 Jesus replied to them, "Because I did one work of power for you to see, you all marvel at it.
\v 22 Moses gave you a law, and that law says you must circumcise your male children and that you must do that exactly seven days after the children are born. (To be accurate, this rite was from your forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and not Moses, who wrote down the law about this practice.) But because of that requirement in the law, you sometimes have to circumcise the baby on the Sabbath Day. But that is working, too!
