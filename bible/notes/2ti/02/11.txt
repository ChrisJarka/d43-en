\q1 Since we have stopped behaving as we did in the past,
\q1 as though we died when he died,
\q1 we shall also live with him.
\q1
\v 12 Since we are also patiently enduring what we suffer,
\q1 we shall also rule with him.
\q1 But if we say that we do not know him,
\q1 he also will say that he does not know us.
\q1
\v 13 If we are unfaithful\f + \ft Or: stop doing what he tells us to do \f*,
\q1 he will treat us just like he promised to do,

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 You can depend on the words that we sometimes say: "If we have died with Jesus, we will also live with him"
\v 12 Since we endure, we will also reign with him. But if we deny him, he also will deny us.
\v 13 If we are unfaithful to Jesus, he continues to be faithful; for he cannot deny himself."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Trustworthy is this saying: "If we die with him, we will also live with him:
\v 12 if we endure, we will also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:
\v 13 if we are unfaithful,  he remains faithful; for he cannot deny himself."

  * **if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful** - "even if we are unfaithful or fail Him, God is always faithful"
