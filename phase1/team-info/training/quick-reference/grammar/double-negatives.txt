====== Double Negatives ======


===== Description =====

In some languages people use more than one negative in a phrase simply to express the negative. For example in Brazilian Portuguese "Eu não vi ninguém" has both the word não which means "not" and ninguém, which means "no one." It simply means "I did not see anyone." And in some varieties of English people say  "I didn't see nobody" to mean "I did not see anybody." 

Sometimes people use a double negative simply __to express that a negative idea is not true.__ For example, someone might say "No one escaped the fire" and some might reply "No. There was__n't__  anyone who did__n't__ escape." Or someone gets upset over losing their keys and says "My keys are nowhere!" and someone else replies "Honey, your keys are not nowhere.”

Sometimes people use a double negative __to emphasize that the opposite is very true__. For example, "It is not unlikely" could mean "It is very likely."  

And sometimes people use a double negative __to emphasize in an ironic way that the opposite is true__.  "She was __not__ __un__attractive" could mean "She was very attractive." In this case, it is also a figure of speech called [[:en:phase1:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:litotes|Litotes]].

**Examples of Negatives**: \\ 
Lexical items: no, not, none, no one, nothing, nowhere, never, nor, neither \\ 
Affixes: non-, un-, in-, -less \\
Should we include verbs like "neglect," "fail," and "refuse," "prohibit," "stop"?

**Caution with affixes:** - Just because a word has a negative affix does not mean that we should count it. For example "Wicked people will __not__ go __un__punished" means that wicked people will be punished, but "Do not unzip it" does not mean "Zip it up," and "Do not __dis__assemble it" does not mean "Assemble it."

**Caution with words** - Just because a word seems to have a negative meaning, does not mean that we should count it as a negative word. Some examples are: retreat, forget, neglect, fail, refuse, prohibit, stop.
So, "Do not retreat" and "He will not forget" are not double negatives. It’s just that sometimes we can express an idea positively by choosing lexical items that have the opposite meaning. We can write notes like this if you feel it is needed. But do not add a link to the Double Negative tA page. \\
  * **Do not retreat** - This can be stated in positive form. AT: "Keeping going forward" or "Keep fighting"\\
  * **I will not forget** - This can be stated positively. AT: He will remember"
