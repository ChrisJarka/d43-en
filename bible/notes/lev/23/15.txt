====== Leviticus 23:15-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Seven weeks after the priest offers that grain to me,
\v 16 on the next\f + \ft Or: 50th \f* day after he offers it, \add each family\add* must bring to me an offering from the new crop of grain.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 You are to count seven weeks and one day after the priest offers that bundle of grain to me, then on that day each family must bring to me an offering.
\v 16 That would be seven weeks plus one day. And so on the day after that seventh Sabbath day each family must bring to me an offering from the new crop of grain.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 15 Beginning from the day after the Sabbath—that was the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering—seven full weeks.
\v 16 You must count fifty days, which would be the day after the seventh Sabbath. Then you must present an offering of new grain to Yahweh.
