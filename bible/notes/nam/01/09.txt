\v 9 What are you people plotting against Yahweh? He will make a full end to it; trouble will not rise up a second time.
\v 10 For they will become tangled up like thornbushes; they will be saturated in their own drink; they will be completely devoured by fire like dry stubble.
\v 11 Someone emerged from you, Niniveh, who planned evil against Yahweh, someone who promotes wickedness.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Nahum continues the description of how Yahweh will deal with his enemies

  * **you people**  - This word "you" refers to the people of Nineveh.
  * **trouble will not rise up a second time**  - This means that Yahweh will only need to strike Nineveh once to completely destroy the city.
  * **become tangled up like thorn bushes**  - This is one way of describing how the people of Nineveh will face so many problems that will sap the life out of the city (See: Simile).
  * **Saturated in their own drink**  - The people of Nineveh will start to stumble like drunk people; they will lose their sense of direction. (See: Metaphor).
  * **completely devoured by fire**  - This gives a vivid image of how God will destroy Nineveh â€“ like dry grass burnt by fire; nothing will be left.
  * **promotes wickedness**  - encourages people to do wicked things; things that offend Yahweh
