\v 11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold,
there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
\v 12 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!
\p And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.
