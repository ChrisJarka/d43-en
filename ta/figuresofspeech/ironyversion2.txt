====== Irony [ˈīrənē, ˈiərnē] ======

In irony, a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it.


===== Purposes of Irony =====


=====Examples from English=====

**"The used-car salesman told me that this car was a great bargain at only $1000 so I bought it. But now I find out that the radiator doesn't work and it will cost me $4000 to get it repaired. __Great bargain. Yeah, right__."**\\ 
In this example, the speaker expresses his annoyance that what the car salesman said wasn't true."

**"Thanks for holding the door open for me."**\\ 
If someone says this to someone who did not hold the door open for him, he expresses that the other person should have been kind enough to hold it open, and that he is annoyed with that person for not doing that.


===== Examples from the Bible =====

**I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.** Luke 15:7 (WEB)\\ 
Jesus spoke of ninety-nine righteous people who do not need to repent. Jesus knew that there are no people like that. But he was speaking to people who thought that they themselves were righteous and didn't need to repent. This was either a case of irony or of speaking of something as a possibility for the sake of the argument even if it is not.

**Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”** Luke 22:64b (WEB)\\ 
The soldiers were hitting Jesus and they told him to prophecy and say who hit him. This was irony. They were implying that if he was a prophet, he should be able to tell who hit him, but they did not believe that he was a real prophet. They told him to prophecy because they were mocking him and wanted to prove that he was not really a prophet.

//When Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”// Mark 2:17a (WEB)\\ 
Jesus said that he did not come to invite __righteous__ people but sinners. When he spoke of righteous people, that was irony. Jesus knew that there are no righteous people. But some people thought that they really were righteous, and they didn't think that Jesus should allow sinners to follow him. But Jesus invited sinners to go to him and turn from their sins. He was not inviting people who think they are righteous and do not need to turn from their sins.

**He said to them, “Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.** Mark 7:9 (WEB)\\ 
Instead of obeying God’s commands, the Pharisees and experts in the law had made up religious traditions that would be convenient, but would also make them appear to be righteous. Jesus used irony when he said that they __cleverly__ refused to obey God's commands. Using the word "cleverly" made it sound like he was praising them, but really he was rebuking them for refusing to obey God's commands. Using the word "cleverly" showed that he knew that they thought they were clever and that he saw their proud attitude.
