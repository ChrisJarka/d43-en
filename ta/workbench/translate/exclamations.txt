==== Description ====

Exclamations are words or sentences that show strong feeling. In the ULB and UDB, they usually have an exclamation mark (!) at the end.

>Save us, Lord; we are about to die! (Matthew 8:25 ULB)

**Reason this is a translation issue**: Languages have different ways of showing that a sentence shows strong emotion.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

Some exclamations have a word that shows feeling. The sentences below have "Oh" and "Ah." The word "oh" here shows the speaker's amazement. 

>__Oh__, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

>Gideon understood that this was the angel of Yahweh. Gideon said, "__Ah__, Lord Yahweh! For I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face!" (Judges 6:22 ULB)

Some exclamations start with a question word such as "how" or "why," even though they are not questions. The sentence below shows that the speaker is amazed at how unsearchable God's judgments are.

>__How__ unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

Some exclamations in the Bible do not have a main verb. The exclamation below shows that the speaker is disgusted with the person he is speaking to.

>You worthless person! (Matthew 5:22 ULB)

==== Translation Strategies ====

  - If an exclamation in your language needs a verb, add one. Often a good verb is "is" or "are."
  - Use a word that shows the strong feeling. 
  - Use a word that emphasizes the part of the sentence that brings about the strong feeling.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ==== 

1. If an exclamation in your language needs a verb, add one. Often a good verb is "is" or "are."

  * **You worthless person!** (Matthew 5:22 ULB)
    * "You __are__ such a worthless person!"
  * **Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!** (Romans 11:33 ULB)
    * "Oh, the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge of God __are__ so deep!"

2. Use a word that shows the strong feeling. The word "wow" below shows that they were astonished. 
  * **They were absolutely astonished, saying, "He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak."** (Mark 7:36 ULB)
    * "They were absolutely astonished, saying, "__Wow__! He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak." "
  * **When he brought it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.**  (Exodus 4:6 ULB)

3. Use a word that emphasizes the part of the sentence that brings about the strong feeling.
  * **How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering!** (Romans 11:33 ULB)
    * "His judgements are __so__ unsearchable and his ways are __far__ beyond discovering!"
