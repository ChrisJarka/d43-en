\v 14 But everyone wants to do evil, and so they do it, just as if they are falling into a trap.
\v 15 After that, their evil thoughts lead them to commit sin, and this sin takes over their minds until it destroys them.

Then, when evil desires come together, sin is born, which means the person commits sin and can only be forgiven by Jesus. And when sin produces it's final result, death comes, both the death of the body and the death of the spirit, meaniing the sinner is separated from God forever. Only Jesus can save us from this final death.

\v 16 My fellow believers whom I love, stop deceiving yourselves.
