  * **my voice when I....**  - The words "my," "I," and "me" refer to to David.
  * **"Seek his face!" I seek your face** - This is repeated to emphasize its importance. He is not saying he really sees his face, but this is a way of saying he wants to know Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **Seek his face **- "Look for his face"
