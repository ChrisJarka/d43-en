==== Description ====

An alternate translation is a suggested change to the form or content of the ULB because the target language has a different form. The alternate translation should only be used when the ULB form or content will not fit into the form of your language. 

The alternate translation suggestion may include adding implicit information, changing passive voice to active, or stating rhetorical questions as statements. 

==== Translation Notes Examples ====

The "AT:" indicates that this is an alternate translation. Some examples are:

**Making Implicit Information Clear**

>  it is the law of the Medes and Persians, that no decree or statute that the king issues can be changed. (Daniel 6:15 ULB)

  * **no decree...can be changed** - An additional sentence may be added here to aid in understanding. AT: "no decree...can be changed. They must throw Daniel into the pit of lions." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
This second sentence tells what the speaker wanted the king to understand by his reminder of the law. Translators may need to state some things clearly in the translation that the original speaker or writer left unstated or implicit. 

**Passive to Active**

> to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven. (Luke 12:10 ULB)

  * **it will not be forgiven** - AT: "God will consider him guilty forever" 
Translators whose languages do not have passive sentences will need to know how they can translate passive sentences that they find in the Bible.

**Rhetorical Question**

> Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? (Acts 9:4 ULB)

    * **why are you persecuting me?** - The Lord used this question to rebuke Saul. In some languages it would be more clear as a statement. AT: "You are persecuting me!" 
The Lord was rebuking Saul in the form of a question. The translation suggestion provides an alternate (AT) way to translate the rhetorical question if your language does not use rhetorical questions to rebuke.
