====== Jeremiah 26:18-19 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 18 They said, "Remember\f + \ft Or: Think about \f* what Micah, \add the prophet\add* from Moresheth \add town\add*, prophesied during the years that Hezekiah was the king of Judah. He told the people of Judah this:
\q1 'This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says:
\q2 \add Some day\add* Zion \add Hill\add* will be plowed like fields \add are plowed\add*;
\q2 Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins.
\q1 There will be a large clump\f + \ft Or: group \f* of trees on top of the hill where the temple is now.'
\m
\v 19 But did \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* King Hezekiah or anyone else in Judah kill Micah \add for saying that\add*? No! Instead, Hezekiah revered Yahweh, and pleaded that he would act mercifully toward\f + \ft Or: not destroy \f* them. So, Yahweh changed his mind about sending to them the terrible disaster that he said he would send. And now \add if we kill Jeremiah\add*, we are going to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!"

\v 18 They said, "Remember what Micah, the prophet from Moresheth, prophesied during the years that Hezekiah was the king of Judah. He told the people of Judah this:
\q1 'This is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says:
\q2 Some day Mount Zion will be plowed like fields are plowed;
\q2 Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins.
\q1 There will be a large clump of trees on top of the hill where the temple is now.'
\v 19 But did Hezekiah or anyone else in Judah kill Micah for saying that? No! Instead, Hezekiah revered Yahweh, and pleaded that he would act mercifully toward them. So, Yahweh changed his mind about sending to them the terrible disaster that he said he would send. And now if we kill Jeremiah, we are going to bring even worse disaster on ourselves!"

\v 18 They said, "Micah the Morashite was prophesying in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He spoke to all the people of Judah and said, 'Yahweh of hosts says this:
\q Zion will become a plowed field,
\q Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble,
\q and the hill of the temple will become a thicket.'
\v 19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all of Judah put him to death? Did he not fear Yahweh and appease the face of Yahweh so that Yahweh would relent concerning the disaster that he proclaimed to them? So will we do greater evil against our own lives?"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]

  * **Morashite** - a person from the town or region of Moresheth
  * **Yahweh of hosts says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **Zion will become a plowed field ... and the hill of the temple will become a thicket** - "Zion" and "the hill of the temple" refer to the same place. When a farmer plows a field, he turns over all the dirt and uproots all the plants that are growing there. A thicket is so full of bushes that no one can use it for anything. These two metaphors cannot be literally true at the same time, but they emphasize that Yahweh will allow the invaders to completely destroy the temple area. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Did Hezekiah ... put him to death?** - The speakers are trying to get the hearers to agree with what they are saying. AT: "You know very well that Hezekiah ... did not put him to death." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **all of Judah** - The land is a metonym for the people who live there. AT: "all the people of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Did he not fear Yahweh and appease the face of Yahweh ... them?** - The speakers are trying to get the hearers to agree with what they are saying. AT: "You know very well that he feared Yahweh and appeased the face of Yahweh so that Yahweh ... them." 
  * **appease the face of Yahweh** - The face is a synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "cause Yahweh to be less angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **So will we do greater evil against our own lives?** - The speakers are trying to get the hearers to agree with what they are saying. The word "lives" is a metonym for the people. AT: "If we kill Jeremiah, we will do greater evil against our own lives." or "We do not want to do worse things to ourselves." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
