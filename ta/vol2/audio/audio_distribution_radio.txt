//This page answers the question:// //How can radios be used?//

There are advantages to providing audio content on a USB stick, SD card or microSD because many types of locally available technology can play content off these memory platforms. For example, the radio shown here is available in local markets in parts of Africa and it can be found in many homes and workplaces. Local tradesmen often know how to service them when they need repair. All that is needed is audio content.
