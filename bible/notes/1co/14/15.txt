\v 15 So I will tell you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what we should do. \add At times\add* we may pray, \add using\add* only our spirits, \add in languages we have not learned. And at other times\add* we should pray using our minds, \add thinking about the words that we are praying. Similarly\add*, at times we may sing using only our spirits, using languages that we have not learned, and at other times we should sing using our minds, \add thinking about the words that we are singing\add*.
\v 16 Suppose that any one of you praises God \f + \ft Or: thanks God for what he has done \f*, using only your\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* spirit \add and not using your mind\add*. Maybe some people \add will be present who\add* do not know about \add the abilities that God's Spirit gives to believers\add*. Because they do not know what you are saying, after you thank God, they will not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* know when to say "Amen!\f + \ft Or: I \f* agree!"

\v 15 So when I am helping others, I keep in mind the difference between praying in my spirit, which is impossible to interpret to others, and praying with my mind, and that does render into meaningful messages to those who hear, especially when I explain it to them. This is much like when I interpret a word into their language and they grasp the meaning of it. But for me there are different ways to worship:  I can sing in my spirit, and I can sing with my mind. The first is difficult to share with other people, but the other can be interpreted so that many people understand it and they are built up.
\v 16 If you insist on praising God only in your spirit, the outsider will never understand what you are saying, and they can never join in and agree with the message and say, "Amen!"

\v 15 What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, and I will also sing with my mind.
\v 16 Otherwise, if you praise God with the spirit, how will the outsider say "Amen" when you are giving thanks, if he does not know what you are saying?
