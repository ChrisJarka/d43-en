Not all languages have “inclusive” pronouns. If a language has two sets of pronouns for “we,” “us,” and “our,” "ours," and "ourselves," choosing the correct set requires a clear understanding of who is being referred to. Inclusive pronouns include the speaker, possibly others with him, and the person(s) being spoken to.

Exclusive pronouns include only the speaker and those with him—not those to whom the comments are addressed. For more on Exclusive, visit this link: **[[https://door43.org/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_exclusive|Exclusive]] .**

===== Examples from the Bible =====

  - **But Jesus himself was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. They woke him up, saying, "Teacher, do you not care that __we__  are about to die?"**  (Mark 4:38 ULB)
Did the disciples think that only they would die or that Jesus would die with them?

  - **… that which __we__  have seen and heard __we__  declare to you also, so that you also may have fellowship with __us__. And __our__  fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.**  (1 John 1:3 ULB)
Was John including his hearers or not in these underlined pronouns?

===== Translation Strategy =====

Translators whose language has inclusive pronouns will always have to be careful whenever they translate “we,” “us,” “our,” “ours,” and "ourselves." They will have to figure out whether to use the pronoun that includes the person(s) being spoken to or the one that excludes the person being spoken to. Commentaries and translation notes often help make that decision.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

  * … the shepherds said one to another, “Let __us__  go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to __us__.” Luke 2:15 (WEB)

//The shepherds were speaking to one another. When they said “us”, they were including the people they were speaking to - one another.//

  * Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let __us__  go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth. Luke 2:22 (ASV)

//When Jesus used the pronoun “us,” he was referring to himself and to the disciples he was speaking to.//
