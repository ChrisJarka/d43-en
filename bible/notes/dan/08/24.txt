\v 24 His power shall be great—but not by his own power; and he cause widespread devastation, and he shall succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty men and the people who are holy. 
\v 25 By his craftiness he will make deceit to prosper under his hand. And he shall even rise up against against the Prince of princes, and he shall be broken—but not by human power.
