===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Babylon was a golden cup in the hand of Yahweh that made all the land drunk** - The word "land" is a metonym for the people living in the land of Judah. Yahweh punishing the people of Judah is spoken of as if Yahweh were holding a cup of wine in his hand and forcing the people living in Judah to drink it until they became so drunk they were ill. AT: "Babylon was a strong nation that Yahweh used to punish all the people of the land severely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **nations drank her wine and became insane** - 
  * **insane** - "unable to think clearly"
  * **Babylon will ... be destroyed** This can be translated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will destroy Babylon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Wail** - This is a loud, long cry that shows that the person is sad.
  * **perhaps she can be healed** - This can be translated in active form. AT: "perhaps Yahweh can heal her" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
