===== Literal Translations =====

Literal translations focus on the form of the text.\\
=== Other Names ===
Literal translations are also called:
  * form-based
  * modified literal
  * word-for-word substitution
=== Form Over Meaning ===
Literal translations change the form of source text as little as possible, even if it results in reduced clarity of meaning. An extreme version of a literal translation would not be a translation at allâ€”it would have the same characters and words as the source language. The next closest step would be to replace each word in the source language with an equivalent word from the receptor language. Because of differences in grammar between languages, the receptor audience would probably not understand this kind of translation.
=== Weaknesses of Literal Translation ===
Literal translations usually contain the following problems:
  * foreign words that are not understood by the receptor audience
  * word order that is stilted or awkward in the receptor language
  * idioms that are not used or understood in the receptor language
  * names of objects that do not exist in the receptor culture
  * descriptions of customs that are not understood in the receptor culture
  * place names that have no meaning for the receptor audience
