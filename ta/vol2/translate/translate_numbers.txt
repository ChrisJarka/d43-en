====== Numbers - Translating Unknowns ======
There are times that the source language will use words and ideas that are not familiar. If you do not know what the source word means, the Translation Notes and Important Terms pages will help you understand its meaning. Sometimes, however, a word in the source text is a number that is not known to the people who speak the target language.
  * Translators can write numbers using numerals such as “130” and “800” or the words such as “one hundred thirty” and “eight hundred”.
  * Some languages do not have words for all the numbers.
  * If the target language normally uses the gateway language words for numbers it’s ok to use the gateway language words.
  * The translator should choose something that will be easy for people to read and understand.
===== Translation Suggestions =====
Be Consistent in your translations. Decide how the numbers will be translated, using numbers or numerals. There are different ways of being consistent.
  - Use words to represent numbers all of the time. (They might have very long words.)
  - Use numerals to represent numbers all of the time.
  - Use words to represent the numbers that the target language has words for and use numerals for the numbers that the target language does not have words for.
  - Use words for numbers that require few words and numerals for numbers that require more than a few words.
===== Examples from the Bible =====
  - The ULB, Unlocked Literal Bible, and the UDB, Unlocked Dynamic Bible, use words for numbers that only take one or two words (nine, sixteen, three hundred) The ULB and UDB use numerals for numbers that need more than one word (The numerals "115” instead of "one hundred fifteen”)
Genesis 5:3-5// When Adam had lived **130**  years, he became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and he called his name Seth. After Adam became the father of Seth, he lived **eight hundred ** years. He became the father of more sons and daughters. Adam lived **930**  years, and then he died. //  (ULB)
===== Examples from English =====
  - Some English writers use words for numbers up to ten or twenty and then numerals for numbers over 11 or 21.
