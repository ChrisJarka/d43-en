\v 17 Our eyes failed, looking in vain for help;
\q from our watchtowers we watched

\q Our end was near and our days were numbered,
\q our end had come.

  * **for help** - The abstract noun "help" can be expressed with the phrase "people to help us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **in vain** - without succeeding
  * **we watched for a nation that could not rescue us** - Here "watched" represents hoping. It can be stated clearly that they were hoping that the nation would come and rescue them.
