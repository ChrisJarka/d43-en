\v 18 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how
much less this house which I have builded!
\v 19 Yet have you respect to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to listen to the cry
and to the prayer which your servant prays before thee;
\v 20 that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof you have said that you
would put your name there; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place.
