\v 8 And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our
days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;
\v 9 nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
\v 10 but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
\v 11 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to
Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem.
