\v 26 If therefore they will say to you, Behold, he is in the wilderness; go not forth: Behold, he is in the inner chambers;
believe it not.
\v 27 For as the lightning comes forth from the east, and is seen even to the west; so will be the coming of the Son of
man.
\v 28 Wherever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
