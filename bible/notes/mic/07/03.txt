\v 3 Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge
is ready for a reward; and the great man, he utters the evil desire of his soul: thus they weave it together.
\v 4 The best of them is as a brier; the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge: the day of your watchmen, even your visitation, 
is come; now shall be their perplexity.
