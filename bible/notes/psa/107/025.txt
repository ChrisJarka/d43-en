===== translationNotes: =====

  * **he commanded and aroused the windstorm that stirs up the seas** - "he commanded the wind and caused it become a great windstorm that stirred up the sea" 
  * **windstorm** - a strong wind, like the wind that accompanies a strong rain storm
  * **that stirs up the seas** - Here David describes the winds causing the waves to become high as if the wind was an object fiercely stirring something. AT: "that caused the waves of the sea to become very high" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They reached up to the sky; they went down to the depths.** - the description seems to be about sailors on the ocean (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **to the depths** - "deep into the sea between the high waves"
  * **Their lives melted away** - AT: "The men were terrified." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **and were at their wits' end** - The phrase "at their wit's end" means that they did not know what to do. AT: "and they did not know what to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
