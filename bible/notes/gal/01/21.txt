\v 21 Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
\v 22 I was still not known personally to the churches of Judea that were in Christ,
\v 23 but they were only hearing, "He who once was persecuting us now proclaims the faith which he once was destroying,"
\v 24 and they were glorifying God because of me.
