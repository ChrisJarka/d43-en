\v 24 Then they came over to him/Jesus, and awoke him, saying, "Master, master, we are about to perish/die! And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
\v 25 And he said to them, Where is your faith? And being afraid they marvelled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?

    * **Master ** - This refers to someone who has been put in charge over a group of people, and not someone who owns someone else. It is a different word than is usually translated as "Master" and does not have quite the same level of authority.  You may want to translate it as, "Boss" or, "Foreman."
