=== What is Obadiah about? ===

After Jerusalem was destroyed, the Edomites captured fleeing people and gave them to Babylon. The Edomites came under Yahweh’s judgment for mistreating the children of Israel. The book was intended to give comfort to the people of Judah in exile.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Obadiah" may also be called the "The book about Obadiah" or "The sayings of Obadiah."

===Who wrote Obadiah?===

Obadiah likely wrote this book. We know nothing more about the writer than his name in Hebrew means, “Servant of Yahweh.”

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
===What was Edom's relationship to Israel?===

Obadiah refers to Edom as Israel's brother. This is because the Edomites were descendants of Esau, while the Israelite's were descendants of Jacob (Esau's brother). This made Edom's betray of Israel much worse.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How do I translate the concept of "pride"? ===

Pride is a major issue in Obadiah. This word is usually used in reference to people. When Obadiah speaks about the "pride" of Edom, this means that the nation thought they were more powerful than Yahweh and that he would not or was not able to punish them.
