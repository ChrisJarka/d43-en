=====An Accurate Translation=====

The purpose of this section is to make sure that the new translation is accurate. In other words, when compared with the source translation, does the new translation communicate the same meaning (not necessarily with the same wording or the exact order)? 

Read the sections of the translation again, and this time, compare it to the Bible in the source language. For this section of testing, the new translation must be compared with the source (national) language translation. You can do this by reading the new translation and then reading the same section in the source translation, or you can listen to someone read the new translation out loud, while silently reading the same section in the source translation. As you compare these, think about the following questions to see if the translator has made an accurate translation: 
    
* Was everything that was mentioned in the source language translation also mentioned in the flow of the new (local) translation? (Did the meaning of the new translation follow the message (not necessarily the wording) of the source translation? Sometimes if the arrangement of words or the order of ideas is different than in the source translation, it sounds better that way and is still accurate.)
* Were the people introduced in each story doing the same things as those mentioned in the source language translation? (Was it easy to see who was doing the events of the new translation when it was compared to the source language?)
* Are there Important Terms used in the new translation that do not match your understanding of the words in the source version? (Think about things like this: How do your people talk about a priest (one who sacrifices to God) or a temple (the sacrifice place of the Jews) without using a word borrowed from the source language?)
* Are the phrases used in the new translation helpful in understanding the more difficult phrases of the source translation? (Are the phrases of the new translation put together in a way that brings better understanding and still fit with the meaning of the source language translation?)
* Another way to determine if the text is accurate is to ask comprehension questions about the translation, such as, “who did what, when, where, how, and why.” For questions about Open Bible Stories, click here. For questions about the Bible, click  here. The answers to those questions should be the same as the answers to those questions about the source language translation. If they are not, there is a problem in the translation.

If there is a place where the translation is not accurate, make a note of that so that you can discuss it with the translation team.
