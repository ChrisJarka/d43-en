===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This tells briefly about John's growing years. 

  * **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Luke quickly moves from the birth of John to the beginning of his ministry as an adult.
  * **became strong in spirit** - AT: "became spiritually mature" or "strengthened his relationship with God"
  * **until** - "even when." This does not necessarily mark a stopping point. John continued to live out in the desert even after he started preaching publicly. 
  * **the day of his appearance** - "the time he began go before." AT: "when he began to preach in public to."
