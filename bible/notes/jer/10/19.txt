\q
\v 19 Woe to me! Because of my broken bones, my wound is infected.
\q So I said, "Surely this is agony, but I must bear it."
\q
\v 20 My tent is devastated, and all of my tent cords are cut in two.
\q They have taken my children away from me, so they no longer exist. There is no longer anyone to spread out my tent or to raise up my tent curtains.
