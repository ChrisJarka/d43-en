\v 2 They went throughout Judah and gathered the descendants of Levi and the leaders of Israelite families from all the towns. When they came to Jerusalem,
\v 3 the whole group went to the temple and made an agreement with the young king there. Jehoiada said to them, "This is the son of the previous king of Judah. So he is the one who must rule, like Yahweh promised that the descendants of King David must do.
