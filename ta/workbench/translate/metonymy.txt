Many times the Bible uses metonymy. If you do not recognize it as a metonymy you will not understand the passage or worse yet, get the wrong understanding of the passage. \\ 

==== Description ====
**Metonymy** is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. A **metonym** is a word or phrase used as a substitute for something it is associated with.

>and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. (1 John 1:7 ULB)

The blood represents Christ's death. 

>He took the cup in the same way after supper, saying, "__This cup__ is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. (Luke 22:20 ULB)

The cup represents the wine that is in the cup.
 
=== Metonymy can be used ===
  * as a shorter way of referring to something
  * to make an abstract idea more meaningful by referring to it with the name of a concrete object associated with it.
  * to keep certain people from knowing what is being referred to

=== Reason this is a translation issue ===
There are many metonymies in the Bible. If they are not recognized for what they substitute for, they will be badly misunderstood.


==== Examples from the Bible ====

>The Lord God will give him __the throne__  of his father, David.  (Luke 1:32 ULB)

A throne represents the authority of a king. Throne is a metonym for "kingly authority," "kingship" or, "reign". This means that God would make him become the king that was to follow King David.

>Immediately his mouth was opened (John 1:64 ULB)

The mouth here represents the power to speak. This means that he was able to talk again.

>who warned you to flee from __the wrath__  that is coming?  (Luke 3:7 ULB)
 
The word "wrath" or "anger" is a metonym for "punishment." God was extremely angry with the people, and as a result, he would punish them. 

>The elder to the __elect lady__ and __her children__, (2 John 1 ULB)

John was writing to a church that was being persecuted by the government. If the government should find his letter, he did not want the government to know that there what a church there.

==== Translation Strategies ====

If people would easily understand the metonym, consider using it. Otherwise, here is an option.

  - Use the metonym along with the name of the thing it refers to.
  - Use the name of the thing the metonym refers to.
  - Do not make the metonym easy to understand if the speaker did not intend it to be easily understood.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. Use the metonym along with the name of the thing it refers to.
  * **He took the cup in the same way after supper, saying, "__This cup__ is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.** (Luke 22:20 ULB)
    * "He took the cup in the same way after supper, saying, "__The wine in this cup__ is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you." 

2. Use the name of the thing the metonym refers to.

  * **The Lord God will give him __the throne__  of his father, David.**  (Luke 1:32 ULB) 
  *  "The Lord God will give him __the kingly authority__ of his father, David.** 
    * The Lord God will __make him king__ like his ancestor, King David.
 
  * **who warned you to flee from __the wrath__  to come?**  (Luke 3:7 ULB) 
    * who warned you to flee from God's coming __punishment__?"

Do not make the metonym easy to understand if the speaker did not intend it to be easily understood.
  * **The elder to the __elect lady__ and __her children__,** (2 John 1 ULB)
    * I, the elder, am writing to __the church__ and __its members__,
