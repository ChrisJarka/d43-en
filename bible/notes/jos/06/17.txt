\v 17 The city and all that is in it will be devoted to Yahweh for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute will live, Rahab and all the ones with her in her house because she hid the messengers that we sent.
\v 18 But as for you, do not take for yourselves things that have been devoted to destruction. If you take from the devoted things, you will cause the camp of Israel to be cursed and bring trouble to it.
