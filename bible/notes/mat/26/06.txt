\v 6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
\v 7 there came to him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as
he sat at meat.
\v 8 But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?
\v 9 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
