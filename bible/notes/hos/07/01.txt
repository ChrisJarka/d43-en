\q
\v 1 When I would heal Israel,
\q then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,
\q and the wickedness of Samaria.
\q For they commit deceit,
\q the thief enters in,
\q and bandits rob outside.
\v 2 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about;
they are before my face.
