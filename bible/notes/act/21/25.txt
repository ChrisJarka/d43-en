\v 25 As for the non-Jewish believers, we elders here in Jerusalem have talked about which of our laws they should obey, and we wrote them a letter, telling them what we decided. We wrote that they should not eat meat that people have offered as a sacrifice to any idol, that they should not eat blood from animals, and that they should not eat meat from animals that people have killed by strangling them. We also told them that they should not have sex with someone to whom they are not married."
\v 26 So Paul agreed to do what they asked, and the next day he took the four men, and together they purified themselves. After that, Paul went to the Temple courts and told the priest what day they would finish purifying themselves and when they would offer the animals as sacrifices for each of them.

\v 25 But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote and gave the instructions that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from fornication."
\v 26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, announcing the period of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.
