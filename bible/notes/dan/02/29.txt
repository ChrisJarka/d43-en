<usfm>
\v 29 O King, while you were sleeping, you dreamed about events that will happen in the future. The one who reveals mysteries has shown you what is going to happen.
\v 30 And it is not because I am wiser than anyone else on earth that I know the meaning of this mysterious dream. It is because God wanted you to understand what you were thinking.

<usfm>
\v 29 as for thee, O king, your thoughts came into your mind upon your bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he
that reveals secrets has made known to you what shall come to pass.
\v 30 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that
the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.
