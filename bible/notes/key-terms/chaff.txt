====== chaff ======


===== Definition: =====


A thin, dry protective husk of cereal grain that is indigestible to humans and is generally considered to be worthless.  Therefore, the chaff husks must be separated from the grain and are discarded.


    * Once separated from the grain, the chaff can be blown away by the wind if tossed in the air.
    * A person scoops grain into a container and throws it up into the air where it can separate from the chaff.
