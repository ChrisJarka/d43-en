====== threshing floor, threshing-floor ======


===== Definition: =====


A threshing floor is a place for separating food grain from the unwanted chaff and straw.


    * Ancient threshing floors were made of cobble stones, which made it possible to collect the threshed grain.
    * The process of threshing was performed by beating the plants to separate the seeds and chaff from the straw, and tossing the grain and chaff into the air for the wind to blow away the chaff.
