\v 28 because the Jews rejected the good news about Christ, God treats them as enemies, and that has helped you non-Jews. But because they are the people whom God chose, God still loves them because of what he promised to do for their ancestors.
\v 29 He still loves them, because he never changed his mind about what he has promised to give them, and about how he has called them to be his own people.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **On the one hand...on the other hand**  - Paul uses these phrases to explain the difference between God's love for the Jews and his love for the Gentiles.
    * **they are hated because of you**  - "the Jews are hated because of you Gentile believers" God's love for the Gentiles was so great that his love for the Jews seemed like hatred in comparison. (See: [[en:ta:translate:hyperbole]])
