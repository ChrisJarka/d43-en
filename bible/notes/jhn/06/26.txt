\v 26 Jesus replied to them, "Listen to this carefully: Do you know why you are looking for me? It is not because you saw \add me perform\add* miracles \add and as a result have realized who I really am\add*. No! You are looking for me \add only\add* because you had plenty of bread to eat \add after I provided it for you by performing a miracle\add*.
\v 27 Stop desiring food that will soon spoil! Instead, desire to get \add spiritual\add* food that will last forever! Yearn for eternal life! That is what I, the one who came from heaven, will give you. God \add my\add* Father has shown that he approves of me \add doing that\add*."

\v 26 Jesus replied to them, "I promise that what I say is the truth: Do you know why you are looking for me? It is not because you saw me perform miracles. No! You are looking for me only because you ate until you were full of the loaves of bread.
\v 27 Stop working for food that will soon spoil! Instead, desire the food that will last to eternal life! That is what the Son of Man, God's chosen one, will give you, because he pleases God the Father in every way."

\v 26 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of
the loaves, and were filled.
\v 27 Work not for the food which perisheth, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of man shall give
to you: for him the Father, even God, has sealed.
