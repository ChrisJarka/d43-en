\v 1 If you will return, O Israel, says Jehovah, if you will return to me, and if you will put away your abominations
out of my sight; then shall you not be removed;
\v 2 and you shall swear, As Jehovah liveth, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless
themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.
\v 3 For thus says Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
