\v 13 Behold, therefore, I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been in
the midst of thee.
\v 14 Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I, Jehovah, have spoken it,
and will do it.
\v 15 And I will scatter you among the nations, and disperse you through the countries; and I will consume your filthiness out
of thee.
\v 16 And you shall be profaned in thyself, in the sight of the nations; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
