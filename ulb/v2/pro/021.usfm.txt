\c 21
\q
\v 1 The kingâ€™s heart is in the hand of Jehovah as the watercourses:
\q He turns it wherever he will.
\q
\v 2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes;
\q But Jehovah weighs the hearts.
\q
\v 3 To do righteousness and justice
\q Is more acceptable to Jehovah than sacrifice.
\q
\v 4 A high look, and a proud heart,
\q Even the lamp of the wicked, is sin.
\q
\v 5 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness;
\q But every one that is hasty hastens only to want.
\q
\v 6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue
\q Is a vapor driven to and fro by them that seek death.
\q
\v 7 The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away,
\q Because they refuse to do justice.
\q
\v 8 The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked;
\q But as for the pure, his work is right.
\q
\v 9 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
\q Than with a contentious woman in a wide house.
\q
\v 10 The soul of the wicked desires evil:
\q His neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.
\q
\v 11 When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise;
\q And when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
\q
\v 12 The righteous man considers the house of the wicked,
\q How the wicked are overthrown to their ruin.
\q
\v 13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor,
\q He also shall cry, but shall not be heard.
\q
\v 14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger;
\q And a present in the bosom, strong wrath.
\q
\v 15 It is joy to the righteous to do justice;
\q But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
\q
\v 16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding
\q Shall rest in the assembly of the dead.
\q
\v 17 He that loves pleasure shall be a poor man:
\q He that loves wine and oil shall not be rich.
\q
\v 18 The wicked is a ransom for the righteous;
\q And the treacherous comes in the stead of the upright.
\q
\v 19 It is better to dwell in a desert land,
\q Than with a contentious and fretful woman.
\q
\v 20 There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
\q But a foolish man swalloweth it up.
\q
\v 21 He that follows after righteousness and kindness
\q Findeth life, righteousness, and honor.
\q
\v 22 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty,
\q And brings down the strength of the confidence thereof.
\q
\v 23 Whoso keeps his mouth and his tongue
\q Keepeth his soul from troubles.
\q
\v 24 The proud and haughty man, scoffer is his name;
\q He works in the arrogance of pride.
\q
\v 25 The desire of the sluggard kills him;
\q For his hands refuse to labor.
\q
\v 26 There is that coveteth greedily all the day long;
\q But the righteous gives and withholdeth not.
\q
\v 27 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination;
\q How much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind!
\q
\v 28 A false witness shall perish;
\q But the man that hears shall speak so as to endure.
\q
\v 29 A wicked man hardeneth his face;
\q But as for the upright, he establishes his ways.
\q
\v 30 There is no wisdom nor understanding
\q Nor counsel against Jehovah.
\q
\v 31 The horse is prepared against the day of battle;
\q But victory is of Jehovah.
