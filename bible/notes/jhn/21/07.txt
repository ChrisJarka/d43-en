\v 7 That disciple whom Jesus loved, said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, "It is the Lord!" he wrapped his outer garment around himself (he had taken his clothes off when they were working), and jumped into the lake.
\v 8 The other disciples came to shore in the boat, dragging the net full of fish. They were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards away.
\v 9 When they got to the shore, they saw a charcoal fire ready and hot, with a large fish cooking on it, and some bread.
