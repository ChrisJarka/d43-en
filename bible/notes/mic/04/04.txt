===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Micah continues describing the "last days" when people learn and obey Yahweh's law.

  * **they will sit every person under his vine and under his fig tree** - Both the "vine" and the "fig tree" are symbols of prosperity. This phrase describes actions in which people live prosperously and in peace. If grapevines or fig trees are unknown you can translate this more generally. AT: "they will sit peacefully in their own gardens and fields" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **for the mouth of Yahweh of hosts has spoken** - The mouth is a synecdoche for the person. AT: "for Yahweh of hosts has spoken" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the peoples walk ... in the name of their god ... we will walk in the name of Yahweh** - Walking on a path is a metaphor for living one's life. Walking in the name of someone is a metaphor for worshiping and obeying. AT: "the peoples ... worship and obey their god ... we will worship and obey Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
