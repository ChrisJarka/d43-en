\v 21 Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in
every corner of the court there was a court.
\v 22 In the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed, forty
cubits long and thirty broad: these four in the corners were of one measure.
\v 23 And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four, and boiling-places were made under the walls round about.
\v 24 Then said he to me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the
people.
