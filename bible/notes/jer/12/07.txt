\v 7 I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her
enemies.
\v 8 My heritage is become to me as a lion in the forest: she has uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.
\v 9 Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go ye, assemble all the
beasts of the field, bring them to devour.
