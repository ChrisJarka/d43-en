\p
\v 1 Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, a basket of summer fruit.
\v 2 And he said, Amos, what see thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said Jehovah to me, The end is come upon
my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.
\v 3 And the songs of the temple shall be wailings in that day, says the Lord Jehovah: the dead bodies shall be many; in every
place shall they cast them forth with silence.
