====== How to Translate Unknowns ======

There are times that the source language will use words and ideas that are not familiar. If you do not know what the source word means, the Translation Notes and Important Terms pages will help you understand its meaning. Sometimes, however, a word in the source text is an object, animal or other thing that is not known to the people who speak the target language. The following information will help with translating these unknown concepts.

==== Historical facts ====

It is very important to remember that if the term expresses a historical fact, then that fact must be kept in a translation. For example, i<font 13.63636302948px line-height: 1.4;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>n Mark 11:13, Jesus cursed a fig tree. To substitute any other kind of tree would be untrue to a historical fact.</font>

<font 13.63636302948px line-height: 1.4;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Another example is In John 12:14-15.where it says that Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey's colt, which fulfilled a prophecy in the the Old Testament.</font> <font 13.63636302948px line-height: 1.4;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Since it says that Jesus was sitting on a young donkey, the translation should not say he sat on an ox, for example. If the word for ‘donkey’ does not exist in the target language, a borrowed word could be used and explained in the text or in a footnote. For example, “rode on the young of a kind of work animal called a ‘donkey‘.”</font>

==== Cultural objects and practices ====

-- plow (vs hand planting)

-- different words for snow (generic-specific)

-- bread vs rice vs sago = "food"

-- lake vs sea vs ocean

--

Maybe 'snow', 'lake'….? Types of food, food products, crops?  bread vs food

Maybe this topic does need a separate page to list out it's subcategories?????

See the example of translating '[[:en:bible:notes:luk:09:61|plow']] in Luke 9:62.

==== Animals ====

An example of the use of an animal in the Bible is in John 10:12 where the word "wolf" is used as a way to describe a person who is harmful to God's people. There are many things to describe about a wolf but what is important in this verse is that it is a fierce and dangerous animal that frightens and harms the sheep.

If a wolf is an unknown animal in your culture, you could substitute an animal that looks similar and that has similar characteristics. For example, large wild dogs are similar to wolves. They attack and eat other animals, such as lambs. So “wolves” could be translated with a generic term like “wild dogs” or “fierce dogs” or with the name of a specific animal like a dog that your people know of, such as “coyotes” or “jackals”. You could also use a general descriptive phrase such as, "a dangerous wild animal" that focuses on the characteristics that are being highlighted in the text.

Also see the Translation Note at Luke 10:3 for other translation suggestions for <font 14.3999996185303px line-height: 15.6800003051758px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>'</font> [[:en:bible:notes:luk:10:03|wolf']]<font 14.5454540252686px line-height: 15.6800003051758px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>'.</font>

==== Cultural ====

There might be many differences between the biblical culture and the Receptor Language culture. You need to be careful not to change historical facts but to translate in a way the original intended meaning will be understood by the new audience.

This practice could be explained in a footnote or Bible teaching. The explanations could include a known cultural practice that has the same meaning as the one described in the Bible text. For example, in Jewish culture, grief, and repentance for sin were shown by wearing a rough type of cloth (sackcloth) and putting ashes on the head. Wailing was another sign of grief. In other cultures grief may be shown in different ways. But if this practice was something that actually happened it needs to be recorded as such with an explanation that tells what it means, perhaps using a practice from the target culture that has the same meaning.

Word more general in meaning - In certain cultures when men greeted other men who where family or friends, they would kiss them on one cheek or both cheeks. This can be translated as “to greet him with a kiss” or “to greet him by kissing him.” If your readers would find it embarrassing to say that a man would kiss another man, you could translate it in a more general way: “to give him a friendly greeting.”

See the example of [[:en:bible:notes:luk:22:47|'greet with a kiss']] in Luke 22:47.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Here are suggestions to keep in mind when translating something that is not in your language:

  * Use a descriptive phrase. You will most likely need to use a phrase to explain the meaning of the unknown word. It is important only to describe the part of the meaning which is being used in the particular verse being translated.
  * Substitute something similar. At times the exact word may be unknown to the people of the target language but there might be something similar that could be used in its place.
  * Use a foreign word from another language. Foreign words are words taken from a language that is not usually spoken by the people of the target language. You could also use the foreign word together with a general word or descriptive phrase.
  * Use a word that is more general in meaning. An example would be  "work animal" which is more general than the word "donkey because a donkey is a kind of work animal.
  * Use a word or phrase that is more specific in meaning. Sometimes there is no general word in the target language to describe the term, therefore you can give specific examples of the term being referred to. An example would be if there is no word for "lights" to refer to heavenly bodies, you could possibly say "the sun and the moon" using specific words.
