====== The translationAcademy ======

The “translationAcademy” is intended to enable anyone, anywhere to learn the basics of how to translate the Bible into their own language, or help someone who wants to do so. It is intended to be highly flexible, can be in-advance or just-in-time (or both, as needed), modular, and highly visual, in web and offline mobile video formats.

We need “Domain Experts” to start identifying the modules that are needed in each area of focus, and then writing up the content and (soon) recording the teaching videos. The draft of the big picture overview is nearly ready for distribution and will be made available here and on the [[https://basecamp.com/2676946/projects/6340506|translationAcademy Group on Base Camp]] or join the Hall group.
