\v 7 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to your servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if you go not forth,
there will not wait a man with you this night: and that will be worse to you than all the evil that has befallen you
from your youth until now.
\v 8 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the
gate: and all the people came before the king.
