\v 10 Our enemies will also see that, and they will be disgraced
\q2 because they \add ridiculed us\add*, saying
\q1 "Why is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Yahweh, that God of yours, \add not helping you\add*?"
\q2 But with our own eyes we will see them when they are defeated;
\q2 we will see them trampled
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* mud in the streets.

\v 10 Then my enemy will see it,
\q and shame will cover the one who said to me,
\q "Where is Yahweh your God?"
\q My eyes will look at her;
\q she will be trampled down like the mud in the streets.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Micah continues and ends the poem that began in [[:en:bible:notes:mic:07:07|7:8]], speaking as if he were one woman speaking to her enemy, another woman. This is perhaps the daughter of Zion ([[:en:bible:notes:mic:01:13|1:13]]), which represents the people of Israel, speaking to the "daughter of soldiers" ([[:en:bible:notes:mic:05:01|5:1]]), which represents the nations who attacked Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **my enemy ... the one who said ... your God ... my eyes** - The words "enemy," "one," "your," and "my" here refer to the women in the poem and so are feminine singular.
  * **Where is Yahweh your God?** - The enemy uses a question to mock the people of Israel. AT: "Yahweh your God cannot help you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **My eyes** - This phrase here refers to the whole person. AT: "I" or "We" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **she will be trampled down** - AT: "her enemies will trample her down" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **like the mud in the streets** - People walk on mud without thinking they are doing anything evil. People will destroy Israel's enemies without thinking they are doing anything evil. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
