\v 1 The last visit I made to Corinth I know that I hurt you very much by what I said to you. I decided this time, I would do everything in my power, so that I would not hurt you any more.
\v 2  I caused you so much pain on my last visit, but the person who could cheer me up the most, is the same person I hurt when I was there.
