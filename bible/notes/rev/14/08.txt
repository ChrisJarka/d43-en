===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Fallen, fallen** - This word is repeated for emphasis. It means "completely destroyed."
  * **Babylon the great** - "Babylon the large city" or "the important city of Babylon." This was probably a symbol for the city of Rome. It was large, wealthy, and sinful. 
  * **drink the wine of her sexual immorality** - The angel speaks of the people of "Babylon" being punished as if they had to drink strong, intoxicating wine. They were being punished because they were sexually immoral. AT: "be punished for being sexually immoral" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **her sexual immorality** - This may well have a double meaning: literal sexual immorality and also the worship of false gods. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **made all the nations drink the wine of her sexual immorality** - AT: "punished all the nations for their sexual immorality"
