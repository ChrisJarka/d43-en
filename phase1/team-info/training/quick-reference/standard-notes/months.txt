====== Months ======

===== Explanation: =====

We have an Important Terms page for biblical months. It explains solar and lunar calendars and gives the approximate length of a month. If a verse mentions a month as a measurement of time, all that is needed is a link to the "biblical month" page:

  * **for seven months** - (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaltimemonth]])

But, if the verse refers to a specific month, then we need to provide information in the translation notes that will help translators relate the biblical months to their own months and seasons. These notes should include:

  - Equivalent months on western calendars
  - Seasonal and agricultural information if it is relevant to the context

===== Standard Notes: =====

Months are identified in different ways in the Bible. Sometimes the name of the month is used (e.g. Abib, Ziv, Sivan), sometimes it is called by it order in the calendar year (e.g. first month, second month, third month), and sometimes a specific day is included (e.g. "the fifteenth day of the first month"). The notes should be adjusted for each situation and include all relevant links to Important term and Academy pages.

  * **the month of Abib** - This is the name of the first month in the Hebrew calendar. IT marks the beginning of the spring season when the late rains come and people begin to harvest their crops. Abib is during the last part of March and the first part of April on western calendars. (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaltimemonth]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])




  * **Abib/Nissan** - This is the first month of the Hebrew calendar and marks when God brought the people of Israel out of Egypt. It is at the beginning of the spring season when the late rains come and people begin to harvest their crops. March and April
