\v 10 Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother,
profaning the covenant of our fathers?
\v 11 Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the
holiness of Jehovah which he loveth, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
\v 12 Jehovah will cut off, to the man that does this, him that wakes and him that answereth, out of the tents of Jacob, and
him that offers an offering to Jehovah of hosts.
