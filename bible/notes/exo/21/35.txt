\v 35 If one man’s ox hurt another’ man's ox so that it dies, then they will sell the live ox and divide its price, and they will also divide the dead one.
\v 36 But if it was known that the ox had a habit of goring in time past, and its owner has not kept it in, he will surely pay ox for ox, and the dead animal shall be his own."
