\v 9 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: It is enough from you, chiefs of Israel! Remove violence and havoc and perform justice and righteousness! Quit your evictions of my people!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 10 You must have accurate balances, accurate ephahs, and accurate baths!
\v 11 The ephah and the bath will be the same amount, so that a bath will be a tenth of a homer; the ephah will be a tenth of a homer. Their measure will be according to the homer.
\v 12 The shekel will be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty five shekels, fifteen sheckels—this will be the mina for you.
