\p
\v 15 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood
before me as the appearance of a man.
\v 16 And I heard a manâ€™s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to
understand the vision.
\v 17 So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said to me,
Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongs to the time of the end.
