====== know, knowledge ======

===== Definition: =====

To know is the cognitive process of understanding all that is around us, both spiritual and physical.

  * Man can know about God because He has given us special revelation or facts about Himself. We know people because of what we tell each other and what we observe about each other.
  * We also know facts about science, art or other areas of life by studying the body of knowledge collected about them.
  * The term "know" can also be used metaphorically of sexual relations; as in Genesis- "Adam knew his wife eve and she conceived".
