  * [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_grammar|Important Information about English Grammar]]

Watch this [[http://youtu.be/18F4e-MIyi0|video for the computer]] (http://youtu.be/18F4e-MIyi0) or a [[http://youtu.be/v5dtInoU0Tc|video for the tablet]] (http://youtu.be/v5dtInoU0Tc) (3.5 minutes long) to learn about exclusive pronouns.
**Some languages have two sets of pronouns for we/us/our. The exclusive pronouns refer only to the speaker and at least one other person but not the person being spoken to. See the pictures.**

The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. Like English, these languages do not have separate exclusive pronouns. This is not a problem for translators whose language also does not have exclusive pronouns. When a translator sees the word “we,” they can use the word for “we” in their own language. But translators whose language has separate exclusive pronouns will always have to be careful whenever they read words like “we” “us” and “ours.” in English, Hebrew, or Greek. They will always have to figure out whether they should use the pronoun that includes the person being spoken to or the pronoun that excludes the person being spoken to.

===== Example from the Bible =====
  * Give __us__  each day the food that __we__  need. Luke 11:3 (TFT) \\ //When people pray this, they do not include God in the words “us” and “we”. God is not one of the people who need food. So for this verse, languages that have the exclusive forms of “we” and “us” would use the exclusive forms.
