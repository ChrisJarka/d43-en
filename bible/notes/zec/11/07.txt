<usfm>
\v 7 So I became the shepherd of a flock of sheep that were about to be slaughtered \add for their meat to be sold\add* to the dealers. I took good care of the sheep, even the ones that were the weakest sheep. Then I took two shepherds' staffs\f + \ft Or: walking sticks \f*. I named the one staff 'Kindness' and the other staff 'Union.' And I took good care of the sheep.
\v 8 But the three shepherds detested me, and I became impatient with them. Within one month I dismissed\f + \ft Or: got rid of \f* those shepherds \add who had previously been taking care of the flock\add*.
\p
\v 9 So I said \add to the dealers\add*, "I will no longer be the shepherd. I will allow the ones that are dying to die. I will allow the ones that are getting lost to get lost. And I will not prevent those that remain from destroying each other."

\v 7 So I will shepherd the flock of the slaughter because of the poor of the flock--for these are mine--with two staffs.
One staff I called 'Favor' and the other I called 'Unity.' So I shephereded the flock.
\v 8 And I destroyed three shepherds in one month when my soul had grown weary of them, since their soul also despised me.
\v 9 Then I said, 'I will not shepherd you. The one that is dying will die and the one that strays will stray into destruciton
and those who remain will each eat the flesh of their neighbor.'
