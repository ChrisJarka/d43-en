The Formal 'You' is used when addressing someone in authority. The Informal 'You' is used when talking with a peer or someone with less authority. Most languages that make this distinction will use the formal form for strangers or people one does not know very well and/or to show respect to people of higher status.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

Some of you will be translating from a language like English that does not use formal and informal forms of “you.” If your language has formal and informal forms, you may sometimes wonder what the relationship is between two people in the Bible. You need to know this in order to know which form to use. The people who are writing the translationNotes will try to give you the information you need in order to help you make your decision.

Some of you will be translating from a language that has formal and informal forms of “you”, such as Spanish and French. Even though these languages mark formal and informal “you”, you still need to know the relationship between the people talking in order to know which form of “‘you”’ they would have used. This is because the rules in your language may not be exactly the same as the language you are translating from. So for you too, the people who are writing the translationNotes will try to give you the information you need in order to help you make your decision.

==== Example from the Bible - Formal ====

Here are some examples from the Bible of where languages that make this distinction would use the **formal**  form of “‘you”.

>Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.  (Luke 1:3-4)

It is thought that Theophilus was probably a high official, judging from the way Luke addresses him as “most excellent.” If so, in many languages, the formal form of “you” (here and in the surrounding verses) would be used.
