===== translationNotes: =====


  * **because of the sins of the house of Israel** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the people of Israel. AT: "because the people of Israel have sinned against me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **All this is** - "The Lord will come and judge"
  * **What is Jacob's transgression?** - The name Jacob is a metonym for those of his descendants who live in the northern kingdom of Israel.
  * **Is it not Samaria?** - The name of the place is a metonym for the evil activities that take place there. Micah uses a question to show that both he and those who hear him know the answer to the question he has just asked. AT: "You know that it is Samaria." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **What is Judah's high place?** - The words "high place" are a synecdoche for the entire system of idol worship, and the name of the land is a metonym for the people who live there. AT: "Where do the people of Judah go to worship idols?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Is it not Jerusalem?** - The name of the place is a metonym for the evil activities that take place there. Micah uses a question to show that both he and those who hear him know the answer to the question he has just asked. AT: "You know that it is Jerusalem." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
