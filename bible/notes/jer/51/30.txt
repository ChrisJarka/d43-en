<usfm>
\v 30 The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they remain in their strongholds; their might has failed; they are become as women: her dwelling-places are set on fire; her bars are broken.
\v 31 One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter:
\v 32 and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
