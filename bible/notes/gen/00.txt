**What is “Genesis”?**

Genesis answers the question: where do we come from? Genesis is the account of how God brought creation into existence out of nothing. The story of creation tells us that God made a perfect home for man where he would make himself known to human beings. 

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
These titles often describe the author or audience of the biblical book. Many titles summarize the contents of the book. It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or to follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]). “Genesis” means “in the beginning.” 

**What is Genesis about?**

Much of Genesis is about how human beings were made by God and the purpose of human life.  God relates to us and to all creation through [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenants]] that he has made. Human beings are different from animals because God gave us some of his qualities and abilities.\\

Genesis is a record of God’s mighty acts, the beginning of human life, and how [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] brought [[:en:obe:kt:death|death]] and separation between people and God. Yet Genesis gives us hope and tells us about God’s ultimate promise to [[:en:obe:kt:save|save]] us. 

**Who wrote Genesis?**

The Bible tells us that Moses composed the book of Genesis. The writers of both the Old and New Testament confirm his part in the composition of the book of Genesis. Ultimately, one can say that God is the author of Genesis because he inspired Moses’s writings.

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
These titles often describe the author or audience of the biblical book. Many books summarize the contents of the book. It is suggested to follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible or a self-explanatory titles are acceptable (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]).“Genesis” means “in the beginning.”

**What are the different parts of Genesis?**\\

Genesis 1–11 is an account of the early years of creation. It very briefly records significant events occurring over a period of several thousand years. Genesis 12–50 focuses on the special relationship God began with Abraham and his descendants. Abraham’s descendants, who would be known as the Hebrews or Israelites, would come to worship Yahweh. Genesis ends with Abraham’s descendants living in Egypt with the hope of returning one day to the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland]]. \\

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**What are the covenants mentioned in Genesis?**

There are three covenants mentioned in Genesis. The covenant with Adam involved God’s instruction not to eat fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The punishment for disobedience would be death. The covenant that God made with Noah was a promise to never again destroy the world with a flood. God made yet another covenant with Abraham. In it, God promised to make his descendants into a great nation. He also promised to protect them and to give them land of their own.

**What was God's purpose for the book of Genesis?**

The book of Genesis says that a perfect God created a perfect world. However, the world became imperfect because human beings began to [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]]. But Genesis shows that God continues to have complete control over the world.

Genesis also describes the start of God's plan to bring the sinful world back to himself. An important event in this process occurred when God began a special relationship with Abraham and his descendants. He expressed this relationship in a covenant with Abraham.

**What was the custom for [[:en:obe:kt:inherit|inheritance]] as described by Genesis?**

The cultural concepts of inheritance and of the passing on of a father's [[:en:obe:kt:bless|blessing]] are very significant in Genesis. The blessing that Abraham passed on to his son Isaac placed him as an ancestor of the people of Israel. This is unlike the experience of Ishmael, Abraham's other son, who did not receive that same divine blessing. Likewise, Isaac's older son Esau foolishly gave up the same blessing, which his younger brother Jacob received instead.

Additionally, it was customary for a man to divide among his sons his material wealth and land. All his sons received equal portions, except that the oldest son received twice as much. The oldest son's portion was called a double portion. It was this double portion that Esau also gave up.

**How does Genesis present sin and evil?**

Ancient Near Eastern societies, like many societies today, view sin and disasters of all kinds as if they were physical dirt, or rottenness, that could spread among people, throughout their communities, and even their land. As a result, many societies have very little trouble understanding the Genesis account of how sin was introduced into the world.

These societies also assume that the way to stop the spread of evil is to perform sacrifices For this reason, many societies still today easily understand the reason for the animal sacrifices of which Genesis speaks.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**What is one way in which Genesis marks the beginning of important sections?**

Genesis uses one Hebrew phrase that the ULB translates as either, "this is the record of…," "these are the events concerning…," or "these are the descendants of…." The information in these sections may have come from sources much older than Moses himself.

If the translator wants to translate in only one way, we recommend a phrase such as, "this is the record about…" or "this is information about…." This Hebrew phrase occurs in Gen. 5:1; 10:1; 11:10; 25:12; 36:1, and 37:2.

**Why are the beginnings of some narrative sections in Genesis difficult to translate?** \\
This is because Hebrew style often makes an opening statement that summarizes the following narrative. Probable examples of this style occur in Gen. 1:1; 6:22; 18:1; 21:1; and 22:1.

Many languages, however, do not prefer to summarize a narrative until the end. In this case, translators may choose a different approach. For example, in Gen. 1:1 ("In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth") , translators may decide to translate like this: "This is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning."

**What is the difference between "people," "peoples," and "people groups"?**

The word "people" refers to all the individuals who belong to a group, such as "the people of Israel." The word "peoples" (used in the ULB) refers to groups that speak the same languages, have the same customs, and worship the same gods, such as the peoples of Edom, Moab, and Ammon. The expression "people groups" (used in the UDB) is equivalent to "peoples" in the ULB. The translator should use the most equivalent term that is common in the project language.

**What is the relationship between individuals and peoples that have similar names?**

Because many of the people in Genesis eventually had large numbers of descendants who lived in specific areas, their ancestors began to be known by their ancestor's name. For example, Cush was the name of a person, but it was also the name of the nation that his descendants formed and of the region in which they lived. The descendants of Cush also became known as the Cushites. If possible, when translating these names, the translator make a strong resemblance between them, as, for example, "Cush" and "Cushite" or "Moab" and "Moabite."

**What does the phrase "to this day" mean?**

This phrase was used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that "to this day" refers to a time which has already passed. The translator might decide to say, "to this day, at the time when this is being written," or, "to this day (at the time when this is being written)." This Hebrew phrase occurs in Gen. 19:37, 19:38, 22:14, 26:33, 32:32, 35:20, 47:26, 48:18.
