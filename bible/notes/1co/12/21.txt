====== 1 Corinthians 12:21-24 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 21 That is why if our eye \add could talk\add*, it should never say to our hand, "I do not need you!" And if our head \add could talk\add*, it should not say to our feet, "I do not need you!"
\v 22 Instead, the parts of our body that seem to be weaker are the ones that are absolutely necessary.
\v 23 And the parts that we do not think highly of are the parts that we clothe carefully. And we protect carefully those parts that we do not show to people.
\v 24 The parts that are \add all right to\add* show people, we do not need to protect. Instead, God, who has put all the parts of our bodies together, causes us to care for in a special way the parts that we think are less important.

\v 21 And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you." Or again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."
\v 22 No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary.
\v 23 And to those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, we give them great honor. And our uncomely parts great comeliness.
\v 24 Now our comely parts have no need, but God combined all the parts together, giving greater honor to those parts which do have need.
