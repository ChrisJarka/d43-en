===== The Translation Process =====

This module answers the question: What are two things I do to translate?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: ['translate_manual']

There are two things to do in translation:
  - Discover the meaning in the source language text (See: [[en:ta:translate:discover]])
  - Re-tell the meaning in the target language translation (See: [[en:ta:translate:retell]])
Instructions for translation sometimes divide these two things into smaller steps. The graphic below shows how these two fit into the translation process.

Next we recommend you learn about: ['translate_discover', 'translate_retell', 'translate_tems']
