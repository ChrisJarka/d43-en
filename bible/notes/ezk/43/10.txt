\v 10 Son of man, you yourself report of the house to the house of Israel so they will be ashamed of their iniquities and measure this pattern.
\v 11 For if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the designs for the house and its arrangements, its exits and its entrances and all their designs, all its statutes with its designs, and all its Law. And inscribe this before their eyes so they will guard all its designs and all of its statutes and do them.
