\v 10 The cities that have strong walls around them will be empty;
\q2 like the desert, they will have no one living in them.
\q1 The houses will be abandoned,
\q2 and the streets will be full of weeds.
\q1 Calves will eat grass there and lie down there;
\q2 they will chew up all the leaves on the trees.
\q1
\v 11 \add The Israelite people are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* dry branches on a tree;
\q2 women break them off and use them to make fires \add under their cooking pots\add*.
\q1 Our Israelite people do not have any sense;
\q2 so Yahweh, who created them, will not act mercifully toward them
\q2 or be kind to them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For the fortified city is desolate, the habitation is deserted and forsaken like the wilderness** - Often in prophecy things that will happen in the future are described as something that has already happened. This emphasizes that it will certainly happen. "The cities that were strong and had many people living in them will become empty like a wilderness."
  * **there the calf feeds and there he lies down and consumes its branches** - Here "calf" means numerous cattle. (See: [[en:ta:translate:synecdoche]]) "the calf" is referring to the people that would come to consume the city. "Branches" is a metaphor for the fortified cities. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **When the boughs are withered, they will be broken off** - The boughs of the trees are the people of Israel. They are compared to dry branches that are broken off.
  * **Women will come and make fires with them, for this is not a people of understanding** - The fortified cities are broken down and women wander in to get wood to make a fire. Alternate translation "The Israeltie people don't understand what is happening. The women are doing what is routine for them."
  * **Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them, and he who made them will not be merciful to them** - "Because they don't understand and turn from their sins, Yahweh will not show mercy to them"
