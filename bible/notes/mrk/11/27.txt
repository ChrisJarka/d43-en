===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **They came to Jerusalem**  - The word "they" refers to Jesus and his disciples.
    * **By what authority do you do these things**  - The words "these things" refer Jesus turning over the seller's tables in the temple and speaking against the things they did and taught. (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
    * **By what authority do you do these things, and who gave you the authority to do them** - This question was asked because the religious leaders did not think Jesus had authority to do the things he was doing or say the things he was saying. They said this to show they thought Jesus should be controlled by their authority. Alternate translation: "You do not have authority to do these things because we have not given you authority." (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
