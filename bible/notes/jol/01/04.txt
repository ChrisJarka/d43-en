===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **swarms of locusts** - Locusts are grasshoppers that fly together in large groups called swarms.  They can destroy large areas of all kinds of plants and food crops by eating them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
    * **swarming locust, great locust, grasshopper, caterpillar** - This is a list of the different maturity levels of the locusts.  Older locusts fly and younger locusts hop.  Caterpillars walk along the ground and climb plants to eat them and this refers to baby locusts who can't hop yet.
