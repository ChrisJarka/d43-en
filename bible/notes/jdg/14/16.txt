\v 16 So Samson's wife came to him, crying, and said to him, "You do not really love me. You hate me! You have told a riddle to my friends, but you have not told me the meaning of the riddle!"
\p He replied, "I have not told the meaning of the riddle even to my mother and father, so why should I tell it to you?"
\v 17 She continued to cry every time she was with him, all during the rest of the celebration. Finally, on the seventh day, because she continued to nag him, he told her the meaning of the riddle. Then she told it to the young men.

\v 16 Samson’s wife wept before him and said, “You only hate me; you do not love me. You have presented a riddle to some of my people, but you have not told me the answer.” Samson said to her, “See, I have not told it to my father or my mother; should I tell you?”
\v 17 She wept before him for all the seven days, while their feast lasted. It happened on the seventh day that he told
her the answer because she pressured him very much. Then she told the people the answer.
