This module answers the question: What is a quote within a quote, and how can I help the readers understand who is saying what?\\

SUMMARY: Multiple quotations embedded within each other demand that correct, clear punctuation aid the reader in understanding the meaning, which may be complicated. ​

===== Description =====

There are many examples in the Bible of a quotation occurring inside another quotation—even up to four layers. Translating these demands that you use correct, clear punctuation to aid the reader in understanding the meaning of the text, which, obviously, may be complicated. If quotes are not marked clearly in a translation, it can be hard for readers to know who is saying what.

===== **Examples from the Bible **  =====
**Examples of two-layered quotations**

In these examples, the opening quote uses double quote marks and the embedded quote is surrounded by single quote marks. See at the end of the sentence that the single quote mark is followed by the double. And the question mark or period sits inside them both.

John 5:12 ULB:

**They asked him, __"Who__ is the man that said to you, __'Pick __ up your bed and __walk’?"__ **

Luke 19:29-31 ULB:

**… he sent two of the disciples, saying, __"Go__ into the next village. As you enter, you will find a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me. If any one asks you, __'Why __ are you untying __it?'__ say, __'The__ Lord has need of __it.'"__ **

**Example**** of a three-layered quotation** in Genesis 20:10-13 ULB. If there are three layers, the third quote level will use double quotes :

**Abimelech said to Abraham, "What prompted you to do this thing?" Abraham said, __"Because__ I thought, __'Surely__ there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.' Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.**

**When God caused me to leave my father’s house and travel from place to place, I said to her, __'You __ must show me this faithfulness as my wife: At every place where we go, say about me, __"He is my brother."'" __ **

**Example of a four-layered quotation ** in 2 Kings 1:5-6 ULB:

**When the messengers returned to Ahaziah, he said to them, "Why have you returned?" They said to him, __"A__ man came to meet us who said to us, __'Go__ back to the king who sent you, and say to him, __"Yahweh__ says this: __'Is__ it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly __die.' " ' "__ **

===== Translation Strategies =====

Some languages don't tolerate many levels of embedded quotes. Some use only direct quotes and others use only indirect ones. Here are ways to indicate quotes within quotes:

  - Use double quote marks for the first (overall) quotation. Use single quote marks around any quotation(s) within that first one. If there are further quotations within the single-quote-marked quotations, then use double quotes around those. And for a fourth layer, use single again.
  - Or, translate an embedded quote as an indirect quote. See Speech Quotations.
  - Or, if a quotation is very long and has many quotations within it, do not use quote marks on the main, overall quotation. Instead indent it, and use quote marks only for the quotations within it.

Restructuring employs freer word choice, and it is up to the translator to determine how free he will allow the word choice to be.
