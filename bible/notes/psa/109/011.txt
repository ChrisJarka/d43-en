  * **extend kindness to him** - It is implied that people would show kindness to him by being kind to his children. AT: "continue to show kindness to him, by being kind to his children." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **May their name be blotted out in the next generation **- Because the name of the person represents the memory of them, David wanted future generations to no longer remembert the wicked people. AT: " May his memory be forgotten by future generations." (See Metonymy)
