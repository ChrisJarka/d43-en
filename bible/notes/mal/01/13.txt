\v 13 You also say, 'What a weariness it is,' and you distainfully snorted at it, says Yahweh of armies. You bring what has been
taken by violence or is lame or sick; and this you bring as your offering! Should I accept this from your hand? says
Yahweh.
\v 14 Cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male, and vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished;
for I am a great King, says Yahweh of armies, and my name is feared among the nations.
