\v 16 I promise what I say to you is true: A servant is not greater than his master. Nor is a messenger greater than the one who has sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, God will give you joy if you do them.


\p
\v 18 "I am not saying this about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But what is written in Scripture must be fulfilled, â€˜He who ate my bread with me as a friend has lifted his heel against me like an enemy.'

lifted up his heel against me.
