====== Galatians 06:14-16 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I myself, however, strongly desire that I never boast about anything like that. The only thing I will boast about is what our Lord Jesus Christ accomplished by dying on the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Because of what Christ did on the cross, I no longer am interested in the things that those who do not trust Christ \f + \ft metonymy \f* think are important, and those people are no longer interested in the things that I \f + \ft metaphor \f* think are important.
\v 15 I will boast about Christ dying on the cross because God is concerned neither that people are circumcised nor that people are not circumcised. Instead, he is concerned only that people conduct their lives in a completely new way.
\v 16 I pray that God will give inner peace and act kindly towards all who will act according to this new way of life. It is all those who live according to this new way of life who are now truly God's people \f + \ft metaphor \f*, as the Israelite people were God's people previously.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 I myself, however, desire very much never to boast about anything like that. The only thing I will be proud about is our Lord Jesus Christ and his dying on the cross. When he died on the cross, he made everything the unbelievers wish for to be nothing in my sight, and he made what I wish for to be nothing in their sight.
\v 15 I will be very proud about that,  because God does not care whether people are circumcised or not. Instead, he cares only that  he changes them into new people.
\v 16 May God give peace and act kindly towards all who live like this. These believers are the true nation of Israel that belongs to God!

\v 14 May it never be that I be proud except of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.
\v 15 For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything, but rather a new creation is important.
\v 16 To as many as will live by this rule may peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
