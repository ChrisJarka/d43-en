\c 83
\d A song. A Psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 O God, keep not you silence:
\q Hold not your peace, and be not still, O God.
\q
\v 2 For, lo, your enemies make a tumult;
\q And they that hate you have lifted up the head.
\q
\v 3 They take crafty counsel against your people,
\q And consult together against your hidden ones.
\q
\v 4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation;
\q That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
\q
\v 5 For they have consulted together with one consent;
\q Against you do they make a covenant:
\q
\v 6 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;
\q Moab, and the Hagarenes;
\q
\v 7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek;
\q Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre:
\q
\v 8 Assyria also is joined with them;
\q They have helped the children of Lot. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 9 Do you to them as to Midian,
\q As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;
\q
\v 10 Who perished at Endor,
\q Who became as dung for the earth.
\q
\v 11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb;
\q Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;
\q
\v 12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession
\q The habitations of God.
\q
\v 13 O my God, make them like the whirling dust;
\q As stubble before the wind.
\q
\v 14 As the fire that burns the forest,
\q And as the flame that sets the mountains on fire,
\q
\v 15 So pursue them with your tempest,
\q And terrify them with your storm.
\q
\v 16 Fill their faces with confusion,
\q That they may seek your name, O Jehovah.
\q
\v 17 Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever;
\q Yea, let them be confounded and perish;
\q
\v 18 That they may know that you alone, whose name is Jehovah,
\q Are the Most High over all the earth.
