====== Translation Notes Teams Manager ======

===== Short Description: =====

Manage teams that will be creating resources to support Wycliffe Associates' strategies to advance Bible translation by developing web-based translation resources for mother-tongue translators.

===== General Responsibilities: =====

  * Train and manage teams of note writers to create high quality translation notes.
  * Build a network of teams to develop translation notes for specific Bible books.
  * Provide on-going training to the writers so that the notes achieve the necessary high standards.
  * Communicate and support the leads of the teams that are writing the Translation Notes.
  * Work in collaboration with Translation Specialists to assure notes are of high quality.
  * Maintain an aggressive schedule to achieve goals.

===== Process to Review =====

  * Receive notification that notes are ready for checking.
  * Use the checklist to assess the work.
  * Make sure Translation Academy notes are present as needed:
    * Add tA links when missing
    * Add tA topics when missing
    * Notify tA team of need for new topics by adding the "talink" tag and putting a note about the need in the notes Discussion section
  * Make sure Important Terms exist and are linked as needed:
    * Create links to existing OBE pages as needed by referring to the [[en:obe:home]] and noting whether the terms are in the KT or Other namespace
    * Add the “ktlink” tag to notes pages that need new terms created, and place a note in the notes Discussion section to explain the need
    * Add the "ktlink" tag to notes pages that need to have a term modified, and also add a note to the Discussion section of the Term page to explain the need
  * Communicate with the Notes Team Leader regarding the quality of notes.
  * Communicate with the Reviewer about any questions/requests from the Team.
  * Change the 'check' tag to 'review.'

===== Learning to Improve Notes =====

  * Learn from and share with other Managers.
  * Study pages that are at 'publish' status to ascertain ways the Teams can improve.
  * Look for comments from the reviewers in the discussion area of the notes pages. These notes will begin with "**Manager**" in bold text.
      * Those pages will be tagged with “mgr” followed by the three-letter book code. For example, a comment on Matthew would be tagged as “mgrmat”. You can use the Search box to find these occurrences, or use the admin page: [[:en:bible:admin-reports:reviewer-manager-admin|Reviewer to Manager Admin Page]].
      * When you have read and responded to the comment, delete the tag from the page.

===== Issues that Come Up When Reviewing Notes =====

Discuss this list to decide who has the responsibility of each issue.

  * A note might be a Bible study commentary rather than a translation issue.
  * A note might have complicated language that would be hard for some of our audience.
  * A note might not be worded, structured, and formatted according to [[:en:bible:team-info:processes:create-notes|How to Create Translation Notes]]
  * A note might be written as if it is the first time the phrase has occurred when we could explain it a little and say "See how you translated this in 8:19."
  * There may be other issues that need translation notes.
  * Team members may have differing views about how to handle something.

  * (?) Team members may request changes to the UDB or ULB. I discuss these with the editor for those texts.

  * There is a need to revise notes to fit with the revisions to the UDB or ULB.
  * Check that the Important Terms that need to be listed are listed.
  * Add the links to the Translation Academy pages that are referred to in the notes.
