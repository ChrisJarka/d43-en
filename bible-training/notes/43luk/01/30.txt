===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **found favor with God**  - Other ways to translate this would be, "God has decided to give you his grace” or, “God is being gracious to you" or, “God is showing you his kindness.”
    * **Indeed** - This word is sometimes translated as, "Behold" or, "Look" or, "See" or, "Listen."
    * **call his name**  - That is, "call him" or, "name him" or, "give him the name."
    * **will be called the Son of the Most High** - That is, "people will call him the Son of the Most High One" or, "people will acknowledge that he is the Son of God Most High."
    * **will give him the throne of his father, David**- That is, "will make him king like his ancestor David was" or, "will give him authority to rule as king like his ancestor David did." The throne represents the king's authority to rule.  (See [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metonymy|Metonymy]])
    * **his father**  - That is, "his ancestor." The Bible often uses the word "fathers" to refer to ancestors and uses the word "sons" to refer to descendants. The word “his” refers to Mary's son.
