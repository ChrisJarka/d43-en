===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But Jesus knowing this **- The pronoun "this" (or "what they were saying" as in UDB) is not in the original language but generally needs to be added when translating this verse.
  * **Why are you troubling this woman?**  - This is a rhetorical question that can be translated if necessary as a statement (see UDB).
  * **For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. **- The plural pronoun "you" here refers back to the disciples.
