====== John 03:7-8 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Do not be surprised about my telling you that you must be born again \add and have a new life from God\add*.
\v 8 \add Let me illustrate\add*: The wind blows wherever it wants to blow. You hear its sound, but you do not know where the wind comes from or where it is going. Similarly, those \add who do not know God cannot understand\f + \ft Or: control \f*\f + \ft Or: predict \f*\add* how people are born again as a result of what God's spirit \add does\add*."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Do not be surprised when I tell you that you must be born again.
\v 8 It follows this way: The wind blows wherever it wants. You hear the sound of the wind but you do not know where it comes from or where goes. It is just like that with everyone who is made alive by the Spirit.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Do not marvel  that I said to you, 'You must all be born from above.'
\v 8 The wind blows wherever it wils,  and you hear it's  sound , but  do not know where it came from , or  where it is 
going, so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
