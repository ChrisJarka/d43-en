=== What is the Book of Colossians about? ===

There were false teachings in the church at Colossae. Paul spent much of the letter writing about it.  There may have been a group of Jewish Christians who were trying to force the other Christians to follow the Jewish laws from the Old Testament, especially circumcision.  Paul writes specifically to teach Christians that only Christ is needed for God to accept them and that teachings based on human reasoning are useless.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Colossians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul's Letter to the Church in Colossae,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Colossae.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Colossians? ===

Paul of Tarsus wrote this letter, probably while in prison. Paul was also known as “Saul” when he was a Pharisee and a persecutor of the church before his conversion to faith in Christ. He was a scholar in the Jewish law, but he became a Christian and an apostle of Jesus Christ.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What were the religious issues that the church in Colossae struggled with? ===

In the church in Colossae, there were false teachers. These people taught things contrary to Scripture. Their exact teaching is unknown but it probably involved teaching christians that it was acceptable to continue practicing their old religious customs. For those from a Jewish background, this included trying to follow the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]]. For those from a Gentile background, it may have included teachings about the human body being evil and Jesus not being truly a man.

=== How does Paul use the imagery of heaven and earth? ===

In this letter, Paul frequently speaks of heaven as above and distinguishes it from the earth, which Scripture speaks of as below. The purpose of this imagery is not to teach that things on earth are inherently [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]]. Instead, the Christians are to live in a way that brings honor to God who lives in heaven, which is "above."

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Was Jesus created or is he [[:en:obe:kt:eterenity|eternal]]? ===

Jesus was not a created being, but has always existed. He lived before he was born on the earth (called the incarnation of Christ). This is an important theological issue. There is potential for confusion in Colossians 1:15: "(Jesus) He is the firstborn of all creation" and "The Son has first place over everything that he has created" (UDB). It is important that a translation not imply that Jesus is a created being.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Colossians? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of manuscripts that many believe are more accurate. The follow are the most significant issues in the Book of Colossians:

  * "through his blood" (1:14) 

Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to the Book of Colossians.
