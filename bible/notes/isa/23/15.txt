\v 15 In that day, Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of a king. After the end of seventy years there will happen in Tyre something like in the song of the prostitute:

\q1
\v 16 Take a harp, go about the city, you forgotten prostitute; 
\q1 play it well, sing many songs, so that you
may be remembered.
