===== translationNotes: =====

  * **But Levi and Benjamin were not counted among them** - The Levites were supposed to lead worship and not to fight. It is unclear why Joab did not count Benjamin. This can be stated in active voice. AT: "But Joab did not count the men from the tribes of Levi and Benjamin" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the king's command had disgusted Joab** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "Joab was offended by what David had commanded" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **by this action** - Here "this action" refers to David's plan to count all the men of Israel who are able to fight.
  * **so he attacked Israel** - The nature of this attack is not clear. It was apparently enough to cause David to realize that Yahweh was angry with him for counting the people. 
  * **take away your servant's guilt** - This is an idiom. Forgiveness is here spoken of as having guilt taken away. AT: "forgive me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **your servant's guilt** - David refers to himself as God's servant. AT: "my guilt" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
