===== translationNotes: =====

  * **I want you to promise, daughters of Jerusalem** - "young women of Jerusalem." These young women could not hear her and were not present, but the woman speaks as if they were present and could hear her. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:07|2:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **beloved** - Some versions understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman (see UDB), but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13]].
  * **beloved—What will you make known to him?—that** - "love, this is what I want you to say to him: tell him that" The woman speaks in incomplete sentences because she is so deeply worried.
  * **sick because of my love for him** - She loves the man so strongly that she feels sick. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
