\v 13 You say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and you have snuffed at it, says Jehovah of hosts; and you have brought that
which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? says
Jehovah.
\v 14 But cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing;
for I am a great King, says Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the Gentiles.
