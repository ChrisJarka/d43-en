===== Help with Translating =====

This module answers the question: Where do I find help for translating?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_what|What to Start Translating]]

To help translators make the best translation possible, [[:en:obs:notes|Translation Notes]] (https://door43.org/en/obs/notes) and [[:en:obe:kt:home|Important Terms]] (https://door43.org/en/obe/kt/home) have been created.\\ 
\\ 
Translation Notes are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain some of the Bible background that the translator needs to know to translate Open Bible Stories, as well as inform translators about different ways that they might express the same meaning.\\ 
\\ 
The Important Terms are key terms found in Open Bible Stories that are important to translate correctly. Each Important Term has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places where that term is used in Open Bible Stories. This is to show the translator other ways that the Important Term is used and to ensure that it has been translated correctly in those places, too.\\ 
\\ 
Once you have consulted the Translation Notes and Important Terms, then you are ready to make the best translation.\\ 
\\ 
**Please use the Translation Notes & Important Terms when doing your translation!**
