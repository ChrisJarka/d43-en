\v 4 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
\v 5 And it was a handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it
received and held three thousand baths.
\v 6 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to
the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
