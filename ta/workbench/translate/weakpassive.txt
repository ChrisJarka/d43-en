Participles can act like either verbs or nouns. Past participles in verb phrases show either that someone has completed an action—for example, "He had __fattened__ the sheep for the feast"—or that some action has been completed—for example, "The sheep had been __fattened__ for the feast." In noun phrases, past participles give an idea of how the noun came to be as it presently is—for example, "Eat the flesh of the __fattened__ sheep." Because these participles look like passive verbs, we call them weak passives.
 
===== Description =====
Past participles in noun phrases give an idea of how the noun came to be as it presently is. Because these participles look like passive verbs, we call them weak passives.

**do not be afraid, neither be __discouraged__** (Deuteronomy 1:21)\\
Here the entire noun phrase is one word, __discouraged__. The important thing is that the people have courage, that they not be discouraged. It is not important who discourages the people. It might even be impossible to know who would discourage them. The people themselves could even discourage themselves.

**Reason this is a translation issue:** The translator may use so many words to identify the actor in a weak passive that the reader misses the main point of the sentence.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**with his hands full of finely __ground__ sweet incense** (Leviticus 16:12)\\
The phrase "finely ground sweet incense" says that someone is to grind the sweet incense into very small pieces. Who is to do the grinding is not important.

**the __accused__ man should have an opportunity** (Acts 25:16)\\
The phrase "the accused man" says that someone has accused the man, but who had done the accusing is not important.

===== Translation Strategies =====

If a weak passive would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using one. If not, here are other options  

  - Find a word that describes the noun after the action.
  - Use a subordinate clause to describe the noun.
  - Use the most general words possible to identify the actor.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
 
1. Find a word that describes the noun after the action.
  * **with his hands full of finely __ground__ sweet incense** (Leviticus 16:12)
    * "with his hands full of fine __powder__ of sweet incense"

2. Use a subordinate clause to describe the noun.
  * **Eat the flesh of the __fattened__ sheep** (Zechariah 11:16)
    * "Eat the flesh of the sheep __that have become fat__"
    * "Eat the flesh of the sheep __that they have made fat__"
  * **the __accused__ man should have an opportunity** (Acts 25:16)
    * "the man __whom they have accused__ should have an opportunity"
  * **Eat the flesh of the __fattened__ sheep** (Zechariah 11:16)
3. Use the most general words possible to identify the actor.
  * **do not be afraid, neither be __discouraged__** (Deuteronomy 1:21)
    * "do not be afraid or __let anyone discourage you__"
