\v 8 But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their
eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger
against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
\v 9 But I wrought for my nameâ€™s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in
whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
