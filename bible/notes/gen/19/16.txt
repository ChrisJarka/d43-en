<usfm> \v 16 But he lingered. So the men grabbed his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hands of his two daughters, because Yahweh was merciful to him. They brought them out, and set them outside the city. \v 17 When they had brought them out, one of the men said, "Flee for your lives! Do not look back, or stay anywhere on the plain. Escape to the mountains so you are not swept away." </usfm>
