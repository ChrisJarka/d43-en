===== Navigating translationStudio-Desktop v7 =====

This module answers the question: //How do I go from one part to another in translationStudio Desktop?//

Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * //[[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_install|translationStudio-Desktop v7 Installation]]//

=== 'Home' or 'Your Translation Projects' Window ===

  * Each project is listed on the home page. The project information is shown on the bar. Click on the bar to open the project.
  * The Project name, type, language, and progress are shown on the bar.
    * The progress circle will fill in as the translation work progresses.
  * Click on the circle with the 'i' next to the progress chart of any project. The project information window opens.
    * All of the project information is listed: The project name, target language, progress, and the name of the translators.
    * From this screen the project can be deleted, printed, published, or saved (backup).


==== Layout ====

The navigation and menu icons are on the left side of the window. The three dots at the bottom left of the window is the main menu. 


=== Three Dots Menu ===

Click on the **three dots** to open the menu. The project editing screen and the Your Translation Projects screen have two different menus.

From the Project Editing window the menu has:
  * Home (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_translate]])
  * Publish (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_d43publish]])
  * Backup (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_backup]])
  * Print (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_print]])
  * translationAcademy - Opens the full translationAcademy in another window. 
  * Feedback (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_feedback]])
  * Settings (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_settings]])
On the Home or Your Translation Projects window the menu has:
  * Logout (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_login]])
  * Restore (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_restore]])
  * translationAcademy - Opens the full translationAcademy in another window. 
  * Feedback (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_feedback]])
  * Settings (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_settings]])

=== Working View Icons ===

In the project window there are three additional working view icons. 

The **Chapter or Story** icon is the top left and looks like full sheets of paper. Use the scroll bar on the right to read the entire chapter or story in the source language. Read the passage to get an understanding of the meaning of the text. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_create]] for more information.)

The **Chunk** icon is the middle icon on the left and looks like a solid line square over a dotted line square. This is the section that is used to translate the source text into the target language. Scroll down or up to move from chunk to chunk (a small section of the story or chapter). Click on the piece of paper showing behind for a blank page to type in the target language translation of the text.

The **Check** icon is the bottom icon on the left and looks like a clipboard with a check mark. In this view the source text is on the left, the translation work is in the middle. If necessary, scroll from the left to the right side to show the resources for that chunk. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:tech:tsd_resources]] for more information.) Scroll up or down to move from chunk to chunk.
