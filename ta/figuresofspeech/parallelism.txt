===== Examples from English =====

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Do not judge, and you will not be judged\\
Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned.** Luke 6:37\\
This is a doublet. Judging others and condemning others are very similar.

**My soul magnifies the Lord.\\
My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.** Luke 1:46-47 (WEB)\\
This is a doublet. These two phrases mean basically the same thing.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * When a doublet is used in poetry, a sermon, or prophecy, either keep the doublet, or use your own culture's way of emphasizing the point in poetry, sermons, and prophecies.
  * When the doublet is used in a story (a narrative text), either keep the doublet or use your own culture's way of emphasizing the point in narrative.
