\v 17 Then he brought me to the outer court, directly to a chamber and the pavement made for the courtyard all around, and there were thirty chambers on the pavement.
\v 18 The pavement was against the side of the gates, and the pavement corresponded to the length of the gates and the lower pavement.
\v 19 So he measured the length from in front of the lower gate to the front of the inner gate, 100 cubits from the outside to the east and to the north.
