====== 1 Kings 13 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter has two parts: The young prophet's warning to Jeroboam (1-10) and the old prophet's deception (11-34).

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

People should obey what God tells them to do and not what other people tell them is God's will for them. A young prophet came from Judah and prophesied against Jeroboam's altar worshipping the golden calf. Jeroboam pointed him out to be arrested but he could not withdraw his hand. The prophet prayed for him and he was healed and he promised to reward the prophet. But the prophet said that God had told him not to eat or drink there but to return home another way. He started home but an old prophet caught up with him and told him God told him to give the young prophet a meal. So the prophet returned with him and ate and drank. Then the old prophet told him he was going to die because he disobeyed God. So a lion killed him on his way home.
