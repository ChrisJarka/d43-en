<usfm>
\v 15 However, I have not requested that you \add give me\add* those things that I have a right \add to receive from you\add*. Furthermore, I am writing this to you, not in order to request you to begin \add giving me financial help now\add*. I would rather die than to \add receive help from you\add*. I do not want anyone to prevent me from boasting \add about my proclaiming God's message to you without receiving financial help from you\add*.
\v 16 When I proclaim the message about Christ, I cannot boast \add about doing it\add*, because \add Christ\add* has commanded me \add to do it\add*. I would be very miserable \f + \ft Or: \add I am afraid that\add* God would punish me \f* if I did not proclaim that message.

\v 15 But I have not demanded this for myself. And that it not why I am writing this to you now. I would rather die than for you to pay me. If I accepted anything from you, I would have no more reason to be proud of my work.
\v 16 If I proclaim the Good News, I am not doing anything for which I should be rewarded or for which I can boast. I must preach the Good News. God would punish me if I did not.

\v 15 But I have not claimed any of these rights. And I do not write this so something might be done for me. I would rather die than .... rather than my reason for pride be taken away!
\v 16 For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason for pride, because I must do this. And woe be to me if I do not I preach the gospel!
