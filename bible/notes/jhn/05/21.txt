<usfm>
\v 21 For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he will.
\v 22 For neither does the Father judge any man, but he has given all judgment to the Son;
\v 23 that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent
him.
