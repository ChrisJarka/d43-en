====== 'We' Inclusive ======


===== Description =====

Some languages have "inclusive" pronouns. If a language has two sets of pronouns for "we," "us," and "our," choosing the correct word requires a clear understanding of who is being referred to by the pronoun. Inclusive pronouns refer to the speaker, the person(s) being spoken to and possibly others as well. These pronouns are called "inclusive" because, in addition to the speaker, they include the person(s) listening.
