<usfm>
\v 9 Jehu looked for Ahaziah; they caught him hiding in Samaria, brought him to Jehu, and killed him. Then they buried him, for they said, "He is a son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all his heart." So the house of Ahaziah had no more power to rule the kingdom.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they caught him ... killed him** - "they caught Ahaziah ... killed Ahaziah"
  * **they buried him, for they said, "He is a son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all his heart."** - They honored him enough to bury his body because he was the descendant of Jehoshaphat, who was a good king. This can be stated explicitly. AT: they buried his corpse, because they said, "He deserves to be buried, because he was a descendant of Jehoshaphat, who tried hard to please Yahweh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **the house of Ahaziah had no more power to rule the kingdom** - Here "house of Ahaziah" is a metonym that refers to Ahaziah's descendants. Here "power to rule" is a metonym for a king. Since all the adult descendants of Ahaziah were dead, there was no one left to rule Judah. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
