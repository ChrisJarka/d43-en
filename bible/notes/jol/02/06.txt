===== Translation Notes: =====

Joel continues to describe the locust army of Yahweh

  * **their… they**  - These refers to the army.
  * **people are in anguish… their faces become pale**  - "people" refers to Israel. (See:[[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])"Anguish" means the "people" felt intense fear. "pale" means to lose color, a physical sign of fear. This phrase demonstrates that the people become very afraid. Alternate translation: "the people are so afraid that their faces turn white." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:parallelism|Parallelism]])
  * **They run like mighty warriors… climb the walls like soldiers… march, every one in step, And do not break their ranks.**  - The army of locust are described as acting like real soldiers would. (See:[[:en:ta:translate:personification|Personification]])
