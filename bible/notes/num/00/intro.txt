**What is the Book of Numbers about?**\\
Numbers is the story of the people of Israel as they traveled from Mount Sinai in the wilderness to the Jordan River. After many hardships, the Israelites were very discouraged; they rebelled against the leaders whom God had given them. It was at the Jordan River that the people of Israel refused to enter the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]]. Because the Israelites were afraid to follow Yahweh's guidance, he delayed Israel’s entry for forty years (13:1–14:45).

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
The title of this book, “Numbers,” refers to the [[:en:obe:other:census]] that was to be taken of the Israelites. 

**Who wrote the Book of Numbers?**\\
The writers of both the Old and New Testament present Moses as being very involved with writing the Book of Numbers.  However, later scribes and priests probably put the book into its present form; they included material from other sources such as eyewitness accounts and books of history (21:14). “The Book of the Wars of Yahweh” is a book that may have been completed after Moses’ death and that was known to later scribes who worked on the book of Numbers. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**Does God punish Israel as a whole?**\\
Because Israel has a special relationship with Yahweh, who was their God and king, they experienced divine punishment for their sin. Their disobedience was corporate or as a whole. 

**What is the relationship between the Jewish religion and the religion of the nations?**\\
In Exodus, we are told that Israel was to be a "holy nation."  They were to be different than the other nations around them and not worship the [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|false gods]] of these nations.  Their idolatry and worship of the god Baal begins in Numbers. While Israel is [[:en:obe:kt:  unfaithful|unfaithful]] and lost out on divine blessings, Yahweh remained [[:en:obe:kt:faithful|faithful]] to them. Additionally, [[:en:obe:kt:avenge|vengenence]] was prevalent in many Ancient Near East cultures, but the Law of Moses protects people and prohibits the enacting of vengeance. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**Why does Moses speak using third person pronouns?**\\
When an author wrote about something he was involved in, it was common for him to use the pronoun "he" instead of "I" or "they" instead of "we." 

**What type of writing is Numbers?**\\
There are many different categories of writing which occur in different parts of the book.  These often lack easily defined transitions.  This will pose a challenge for translators, smooth transitions may not be possible.
