\v 6 \add God promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that their descendants would all inherit his blessings\add*. But \add although most of my fellow Israelites have rejected Christ\add*, that does not \add prove\add* that God has failed \add to do\add* the things that he promised, because it is not all who are descended from Jacob and who \add call themselves the people of\add* Israel whom \add God considers\add* to be truly his people.
\v 7 And it is also not all of Abraham's natural descendants that \add God considers\add* to be his people. Instead, \add God considers only some of them to be Abraham's children\add*. \add This agrees with what God told Abraham\add*: "It is Isaac, \add not any of your\f + \ft singular \f* other sons\add*, whom \add I\add* will consider \add to be the true father of\add* your descendants."

\v 6 God promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that their descendants would all inherit his blessings. But although most of my fellow Israelites have rejected Christ, that does not prove that God has failed to do the things that he promised. For not all who are descended from Jacob and who call themselves the people of Israel whom God considers to be truly his people.
\v 7 And it is also not all of Abraham's natural descendants that God considers to be his people. Instead, God considers only some of them to be Abraham's descendants. This agrees with what God told Abraham: "It is Isaac, not any of your other sons, whom I will consider to be the true father of your descendants."

\v 6 But it is not as though the promises of God had failed. For it is not everyone in Israel who truly belongs to Israel.
\v 7 It is just as not because they are Abrahamâ€™s descendants are they all his true descendants. But "In Isaac will your descendents be named."
