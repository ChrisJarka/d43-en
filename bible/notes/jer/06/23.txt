\q
\v 23 They will pick up bows and spears. They are cruel and have no compassion. Their sound is like the sea roar,
\q and they are riding on horses in formation as fighting men, daughter of Zion.'"
\q
\v 24 We have heard the news about them. Our hands fall limp in distress. Anguish seizes us as a woman bearing a child.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They will pick up bows and spears** - "The soldiers will carry bows and spears"
  * **Their sound is like the sea roar** - The loud noise that the soldiers make is compared to the loud noise of the ocean. AT: "The sound that they make is very loud, like the sound of the ocean" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **they are riding on horses in formation as fighting men** - The phrase "in formation" means that they have organized themselves and are riding in rows. The phrase "as fighting men" indicates that they are ready to fight. AT: "they are riding on horses in their assigned rows, and they are ready to fight against you"
  * **daughter of Zion** - This refers to the people of Jerusalem. Cities were often spoken of as if they were a woman. See how you translated "daughter of Zion" in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:04:30|4:31]]. HMM. I don't think this cross reference will fit here -- I don't think God is saying "daughter" in order to express his love for them. 
  * **We have heard** - The word "We" probably refers Jeremiah speaking for all the people of Judah.
  * **our hands fall limp in distress** - "our hands are weak because we are anxious"
  * **Anguish seizes us** - Feeling great anguish is spoken of as if the anguish grabs them. AT: "We feel terrible anguish" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **as a woman bearing a child** - The anguish that they feel because the enemy coming to attack them is compared to the anguish that a woman feels when she is about to give birth to a baby. AT: "like a woman who is about to give birth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
