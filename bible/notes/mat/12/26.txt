\v 26 Similarly, if Satan were expelling his own demons it would be as though he was
fighting against himself. His kingdom would not continue! His rule over them would certainly not last!
\v 27 Furthermore, if it is true that Satan enables me to expel demons, is it also true that your disciples who expel demons do so bySatan's power ? No! So they will show you that you are not thinking logically.
