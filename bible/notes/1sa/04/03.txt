\v 3 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore has Jehovah struck us today before
the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us
out of the hand of our enemies.

above the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
