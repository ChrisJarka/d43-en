==== Description ====

Normally statements are used to give information. Sometimes they are used in the Bible for other functions.

**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages would not use a statement for some of the functions that statements are used for in the Bible.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

Statements are normally used to give information. All of the sentences in John 1:6-8 below are statements, and their function is to give information.

> There was a man who was sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify about the light, that all might believe through him. John was not the light, but came that he might testify about the light. (John 1:6-8 ULB)

A statement can also be used to give instructions. The speaker below was not just telling Joseph about something Joseph would do in the future; he was telling Joseph what to do.
> She will give birth to a son, and __you will call his name Jesus__, for he will save his people from their sins. (Matthew 1:21 ULB)

A statement can also be used to make a request. The man with leprosy was not just saying what Jesus was able to do. He was asking Jesus to heal him.
>Behold, a leper came to him and bowed before him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, __you can make me clean__." (Matthew 8:2 ULB)

A statement can also be used to perform something. By telling a man that his sins were forgiven, Jesus actually caused the man's sins to be forgiven.
>Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "Son, __your sins are forgiven__."  (Luke 2:5 ULB)

==== Translation Strategies ====
