\v 8 If anyone does not take care of those who live in his own house, and especially if he does not take care of his own family, he has denied\f + \ft Or: quit believing \f* what we believe and \add we should consider that\add* he is worse than a person who does not believe \add in Christ\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 You should announce these things so that those who hear you will not do anything wrong.
\v 8 But anyone who does not try to help his own relatives, especially those who live in his own house, that person rejects what we believe. He is, in fact, worse than an unbeliever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7  Preach these things so that the believers may be beyond reproach.
\v 8 But if someone does not provide for his own relatives, especially for those of his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
