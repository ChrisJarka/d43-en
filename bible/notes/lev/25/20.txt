\v 20 You might say, "What will we eat during the seventh year? Look, we cannot plant or gather our produce!" 
\v 21 I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it will produce fruit for three years.
\v 22 You will plant in the eighth year  and eat from that produce and the stored food. Until the fruits of the ninth year come in, you will be able to eat from the abundance stored in the previous years.
