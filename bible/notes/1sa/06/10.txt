\v 12 Then the cows started walking, and they went straight toward Beth-Shemesh. They stayed on the road, and were mooing all the time. They did not turn to the left or to the right. The five kings of the Philistia area followed the cows until they reached the edge of Beth-Shemesh.

\v 10 And the men did so, and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;
\v 11 and they put the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.
\v 12 And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and
turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of
Beth-shemesh.
