\v 12 

 I will continue by telling you what I did after I wrote to you from Ephesus city. I went to city of Troas so I might tell them the message about Christ. When I arrived there, the Lord opened many opportunities for me to serve him in that city,
\v 13 but I had no peace of mind because I could not find my brother Titus. I then left Troas and traveled to Macedonia.

\v 12 When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, and though a door was opened to me by the Lord,
\v 13 I had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus. So I left them and went into Macedonia.
