Some languages can use an adjective or another phrase with a noun to give information about that noun or to remind people of something about it.
  * Mary gave some of the food to her sister, who was very thankful.
    * The phrase “who was very thankful” can be used to inform us about how Mary's sister responded when Mary gave her the food. In this case it does not distinguish this sister from another sister that Mary might have. It simply gives added information about that sister.

===== Description ===== 
 
Some languages can use an adjective or another phrase with a noun to give information about that noun or to remind people of something about it.  

  * Mary gave some of the food to her sister, __who was very thankful__. 
    * The phrase "who was very thankful" can be used to inform us about how Mary's sister responded when Mary gave her the food. In this case it does not distinguish this sister from another sister that Mary might have. 
 
**Reason this is a translation Issue:** Some languages do not do this. If people see an adjective or another phrase right next to a noun, they will assume that the purpose of the phrase is to distinguish that thing from other possible things it could refer to.

 
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**The name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Asshur.** (Genesis 2:14) \\  
There is only one Tigris River. The phrase "which flows east of Assur" gives more information about where the Tigris River was.  
 
**I will wipe away mankind whom I have created from the surface of the earth.** (Genesis 6:7) \\ 
The phrase "whom I have created" is a reminder of the relationship between God and mankind.  
 
===== Translation Strategies ===== 
If people would understand the purpose of a phrase with a noun, then consider keeping  the phrase and the noun together. Otherwise here are other strategies of showing that the phrase is used to inform or remind.
  - Simply put the informing or reminding word or phrase in a separate sentence.  
  - Put the  informing or reminding word or phrase in a separate phrase with words that show why the information is important.    
  
===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
1.  Simply put the informing or reminding word or phrase in a separate sentence.  
  * **I hate those who serve worthless idols**  (Psalm 31:6) - When David spoke of "worthless idols," he was acknowledging that idols are worthless. He was not distinguishing worthless idols from valuable idols.  
    * "I hate those who serve idols. Idols are worthless."   
  
2.  Put the  informing or reminding word or phrase in a separate phrase with words that show why the information is important.    

  * **I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised** (2 Samuel 22:4) - There is only one Yahweh. The phrase "who is worthy to be praised" gives a reason for calling on Yahweh. This can be shown with the word "because."  
    * "I will call on Yahweh, because he is worthy to be praised"     
 
   * **Can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a son?** - (Genesis 17:17-18)  - The phrase “who is ninety years old” is a reminder of Sarah's age. It tells why Abraham was asking the question. He did not expect that a woman who was that old could bear a child.
    * "Sarah is ninety years old. Can she at bear a son when she is that old?"
