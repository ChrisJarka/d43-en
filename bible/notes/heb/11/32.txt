\v 32 And what shall I more say? for the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; of David and Samuel and the prophets:
\v 33 who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
\v 34 quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, waxed mighty in war, turned to flight armies of aliens.
