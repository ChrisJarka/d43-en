===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **the devil led **- That is "the devil brought" or "the devil took." This was probably not the devil leading the way and Jesus was following him. Rather, it was an active effort of putting him at the described destination.
    * **the very highest point**  - this was the corner winglet of the roof of the temple in Jerusalem
    * **if you are**- Same clause as in Luke 4:3, Some see it can be translated as "since you are." Some see it as a challenge based on supposition, that is "if you are really"  or "assuming you are indeed . . show it to me" or "you claim that you are . . . do this."
    * **throw yourself down from here **  - That is, the devil told Jesus to "jump down from here." Here refers to the highest point of the temple.
    * **it is written-**  Or, "it has been written." This indicates authority and truthfulness, that is implying, "it is written in the Scriptures" or "or it is written in the authoritative Scriptures."
