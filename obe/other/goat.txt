===== Definition: =====

A goat is a medium-sized, four-legged animal<font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>, that is similar to a sheep and is raised primarily for its milk and meat.</font>

  * Like sheep, goats were important animals of sacrifice, especially at Passover.
  * Although goats have some similarities to sheep, there are also some clear differences:
      * G<font 14px line-height: 19.6000003814697px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>oats have dark, coarse hair, but sheep have wool.</font>
      * The tail of a goat stands up, but the tail of a sheep hangs down.
      * Goats are curious and don't stay in a group to follow a goatherd, but sheep like to stay in the safety of the whole herd and tend to follow their shepherd.
  * In Bible times, goats were the main source of milk in Israel.
  * Goat skins were used for tent coverings and wine bottles.
  * In both the Old and New Testaments, g</font>    oats were used as symbols for unrighteous people, perhaps because of their tendency to wander away from the one taking care of them.
  * The Israelites also used goats as symbolic sin bearers. When one goat was sacrificed, the priest would lay his hands on a second live goat and send it into the desert as a symbol of the animal bearing the people's sins.
