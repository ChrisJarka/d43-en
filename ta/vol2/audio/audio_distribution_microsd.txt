===== MicroSD Cards =====

//This page answers the question:// //How are microSD cards used?//

MicroSD cards are small, inexpensive memory chips that typically have plenty of memory capacity to hold many hours of audio content in optimal audio format. Even a 2GB microSD card, which is compatible with most basic mobile phones, has enough space for a full Bible. MicroSD cards are easy to transport and distribute, people are widely familiar with them and they can be used with local technology.

Market availability and costs for 2GB cards are becoming less cost-effective as interest for more memory capacity has come into greater demand. For many distribution applications, a 4GB microSD card may be the ideal balance of all factors and can still deliver a tremendous amount of content at a very cost-effective price.

One disadvantage of microSD cards is that they are easy to erase, use for other media content or re-sell for a good profit in a local market. This has been the fate of countless microSD cards, including ones that are removable from mobile phones and dedicated audio players.
