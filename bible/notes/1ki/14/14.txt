\v 14 Moreover Jehovah will raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even
now.
\v 15 For Jehovah will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which
he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking Jehovah to
anger.
\v 16 And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and wherewith he has made Israel to
sin.
