\v 9 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks;
yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
\v 10 Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the
Amorite.
