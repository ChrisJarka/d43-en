\v 7 All the men who worked magic, the fortune-tellers, the men who worked sorcery, and men who studied the stars came to me. I told them what I had dreamed, but they could not tell me what it meant.
\v 8 Finally, Daniel came to me, and I \add decided to\add* tell him what I had dreamed. One of my officials had given him a new name, Belteshazzar, to honor my own god. I knew that the spirit of the holy gods was in him.
\pi
\v 9 So, \add using the name that had been given to him\add*, I said, 'Belteshazzar, you are the most important of all my fortune-tellers. I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and that you can reveal all mysteries. There is none that is too difficult for you. So, tell me what my dream means.

\v 7 Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers; and I told the dream before them; but they
did not make known to me the interpretation thereof.
\v 8 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the
spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, saying,
\v 9 O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret
troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
