\v 13 But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Jehovah, in an acceptable time:
\q O God, in the abundance of your lovingkindness,
\q Answer me in the truth of your salvation.
\q
\v 14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink:
\q Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
\q
\v 15 Let not the waterflood overwhelm me,
\q Neither let the deep swallow me up;
\q And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.
