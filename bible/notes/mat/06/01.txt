\v 1 "When you do your good deeds, make certain that you do not do them when other people are watching so that they may see you \add and think highly of you\add*. If \add you do good deeds merely in order that other people may think highly of you, God\add*, your Father who is in heaven, will not give you any reward.
\v 2 So, whenever you give something to the poor, do not \add announce it as people announce something that they want other people to know about\add* by playing a \add fanfare\add* on a trumpet \f + \ft metaphor \f*. That is what the hypocrites do in the synagogues\f + \ft Or: in the Jewish meeting places \f* and on the main roads in order that people might \add see what they do and\add* praise them. Keep this in mind: \add People praise those hypocrites\add*, \add but\add* that is the \add only\add* reward they will receive!

\c 6
\p
\v 1 Take heed that you do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: else you have no reward with your Father who is
in heaven.
\v 2 When therefore you do alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say to you, They have received their reward.
