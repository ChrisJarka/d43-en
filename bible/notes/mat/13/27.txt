===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to sit in a boat near the beach and tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * (These verses continue the parable of the weeds.)
  * **servants **- "bondservants" or "slaves"
  * **the landowner **- This is the same person who sowed good seed in his field.
  * **did you not sow good seed in your field?**- This is a rhetorical question that expects a "yes" answer. (See: Rhetorical Question).
  * **Do you wish **- "Do you want"
  * **gather them up**  - This can be translated "pull them up." The pronoun "them" refers to the weeds.
