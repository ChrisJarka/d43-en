\v 1 When Tiberius Caesar had been ruling the Roman Empire for about fifteen years, Pontius Pilate was the governor of the region of Judea, Herod Antipas was ruling the region of Galilee, his brother Philip was ruling the regions of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanius was ruling the region of Abilene. 
\v 2 During that time, when Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests in Jerusalem, God spoke to Zechariah's son John while he was living out in the wilderness.

\s5
\v 3 And John traveled all around the area near the Jordan River. He kept telling people, "If you want God to forgive your sins, you must repent; then I will baptize you!"

\s5
\v 4 The prophet Isaiah wrote these words on a scroll long ago:
In the wilderness, someone will be heard calling out to people:
Prepare the way of the Lord
Make straight paths for him

\s5
\v 5 Every valley will be filled,
And every mountain and hill will be made level;
The crooked roads will become straight,
And the rough ways will be made smooth
\v 6 Then people everywhere will understand how God can save people.

\s5
\v 7 John kept saying to the crowds of people who were coming to be baptized by him, "You people are evil like poisonous snakes! Who told you to try to escape from God's punishment?

\s5
\v 8 Produce good fruit by doing things that show you have truly turned away from your sinful behavior! And don't start saying to yourself, "We have Abraham as our ancestor." Because I tell you that God could make even these stones become descendants of Abraham!

\s5
\v 9 And the axe is already placed4 at the root of the trees, so that every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.

\s5
\v 10 Then some of the people in the crowd kept asking him, "What then should we do?" 
\v 11 He answered them, "If any of you has two shirts, you should give one of them to someone who has no shirt. If any of you has plenty of food, you should give some to those who have no food."

\s5
\v 12 Some tax collectors also came to John to be baptized. They asked him, "Teacher, what must we do?" 
\v 13 He said to them, "Do not collect from the people more money than the Roman government tells you to collect!" 

\s5
\v 14 Some soldiers asked him, "And us? What should we do?" He said to them, "Do not force people to give you money by threatening to hurt them and do not falsely accuse anyone of doing something wrong! Be content with the amount of money you earn."  

\s5
\v 15 People were waiting expectantly and many of them were wondering if John might be the Messiah. 
\v 16 John replied to them all, "No, I am not. The Messiah is far greater than I am. He is so great that I am not worthy even to untie the straps of his sandals like a slave would do! When I baptized you, I used only water.  But when the Messiah comes, he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 

\s5
\v 17 A winnowing fork is in his hand, ready to separate good grain from the useless chaff. He will store the grain safely in his barn but will clear away the chaff and burn it up in an unending fire. 

\s5
\v 18 John kept telling them the good message from God, by urging them in many ways to repent and turn back to God. 
\v 19 He also rebuked the ruler of the district, Herod Antipas. He rebuked him for marrying Herodias, his brother's wife, while his brother was still alive, and for doing many other evil things. 
\v 20 Then Herod had his soldiers put John in prison, which was another very evil thing.

\s5
\v 21 But before John was put in prison, when many people were being baptized, Jesus also was baptized. Afterwards, while he was praying, the sky opened. 
\v 22 Then the Holy Spirit, resembling a dove, came down and landed on Jesus. And God spoke to Jesus from heaven, saying, "You are my Son, the one whom I love dearly. I am very pleased with you!"
