\v 19 Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Judah?
\v 20 His servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla.
\v 21 For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died; and they buried Joash with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
