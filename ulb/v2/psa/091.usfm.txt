\q
\v 1 He that lives in the secret place of the Most High
\q Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
\q
\v 2 I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress;
\q My God, in whom I trust.
\q
\v 3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,
\q And from the deadly pestilence.
\q
\v 4 He will cover you with his pinions,
\q And under his wings shall you take refuge:
\q His truth is a shield and a buckler.
\q
\v 5 You shall not be afraid for the terror by night,
\q Nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
\q
\v 6 For the pestilence that walks in darkness,
\q Nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday.
\q
\v 7 A thousand shall fall at your side,
\q And ten thousand at your right hand;
\q But it shall not come near thee.
\q
\v 8 Only with your eyes shall you behold,
\q And see the reward of the wicked.
\q
\v 9 For thou, O Jehovah, are my refuge!
\q You have made the Most High your habitation;
\q
\v 10 There shall no evil befall thee,
\q Neither shall any plague come near your tent.
\q
\v 11 For he will give his angels charge over thee,
\q To keep you in all your ways.
\q
\v 12 They shall bear you up in their hands,
\q Lest you dash your foot against a stone.
\q
\v 13 You shall tread upon the lion and adder:
\q The young lion and the serpent shall you trample under foot.
\q
\v 14 Because he has set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
\q I will set him on high, because he has known my name.
\q
\v 15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him;
\q I will be with him in trouble:
\q I will deliver him, and honor him.
\q
\v 16 With long life will I satisfy him,
\q And show him my salvation.
