\v 21 It was the men of \add my own town\add*, Anathoth, who wanted to kill me, and they told me that they would kill me if I did not stop prophesying what Yahweh told me to say.
\v 22 So the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels said about them, "I will punish them. Their young men will be killed in wars, and their children will die because they have no food.
\v 23 I have set a time when I will bring disasters to the people of Anathoth, and when that happens, none of them will remain alive."

\v 21 Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, You shall not prophesy in the
name of Jehovah, that you die not by our hand;
\v 22 therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and
their daughters shall die by famine;
\v 23 and there shall be no remnant to them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their
visitation.
