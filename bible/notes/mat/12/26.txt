\v 26 In the same way, if Satan were driving out his own demons, he would be fighting against himself. He will not be able to continue to rule over his servants!
\v 27 Furthermore, if it is true that Satan enables me to drive out demons, is it also true that your disciples who drive them out do so by Satan's power? No! So they will show you that you are not thinking logically.

<usfm>
\v 26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand?
\v 27 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Because of this, they will be your judges.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues an account of the Pharisees saying that Jesus healed a man by the power of Satan.

  * **If Satan drives out Satan **- This is a metonymy showing Satan working against his own kingdom.
  * **how will his kingdom stand**  - This is a rhetorical question. It could be translated as a statement: “Satan's kingdom cannot stand,” or “Satan's kingdom will fall apart.”
  * **I **- "Jesus"
  * **drive out**  -  "force out," "cast out," "throw out," or "put out"
  * **by whom do your followers drive them out **- Possibly this is a rhetorical question meaning "Is it by Satan's power that your son's drive out demons?" or Jesus may be using irony here to show that they were not able to cast out demons at all.
  * **they will be your judges **- Possibly, “Your sons who cast out demons by God's power will judge you for saying that I cast out demons by Beelzebub's power.”
