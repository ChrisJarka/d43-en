===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 if he oppresses the poor and needy, if he seizes and robs and does not return a pledge, if he lifts up his eyes to the idols or commits disgusting actions; 
\v 13 if he lends charging interest or gains unjust profit, should he live? He will not live! He has done all these disgusting actions. He will surely die; his blood is on him.
