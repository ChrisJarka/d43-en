\v 25 God has the right to choose from among both Jews and non-Jews, as the prophet Hosea wrote:
\q "Many people who were not my people—I will say they are my people.
\q Many people whom I did not love before, I will say that I now love them."
\v 26 And another prophet wrote:
"Where God told them before, 'You are not my people,' 
in those same places people will be God's children, who is completely powerful."

\q "I will call my people who were not my people,
\q and her beloved who was not beloved.

\v 26 And it will be that in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people',
\q there they will be called 'sons of the living God.'"
