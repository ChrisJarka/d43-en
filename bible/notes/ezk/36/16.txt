\v 16 Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 17 Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way
before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.
\v 18 Wherefore I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had
defiled it with their idols;
