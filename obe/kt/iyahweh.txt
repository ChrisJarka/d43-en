====== I, Yahweh; me, Yahweh ======

===== Definition: =====

Many times in the Old Testament, when God is speaking about himself, he uses his name instead of a pronoun.

  * For example, instead of saying, "Honor me," he says, "Honor Yahweh." 
  * To make it clear that God is the one talking about himself, the ULB translates this by adding a pronoun such as in, "Honor me, Yahweh" or "I, Yahweh say."
  * By adding the pronoun "I" or "me," the ULB indicates to the reader that God is the speaker.


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

There are three ways that you can translate these phrases:

  * "I" or "me"
  * "Yahweh"
  * "I, Yahweh" or "me, Yahweh"

Your readers should be able to understand that Yahweh is speaking about himself. Choose a form that will not be confusing to them.
