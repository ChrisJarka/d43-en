\v 24 Their huge army will attack you with weapons, riding in chariots and pulling wagons that will carry the army supplies. They will surround you, carrying large and small shields, and wearing helmets. I will allow them to capture you and punish you in the way that they always punish \add their enemies\add*.
\v 25 Because I am very angry with you, I will cause them to act very furiously toward you. They will cut off your noses and your ears. Then, those who are still alive, they will kill with their swords. They will take away your sons and daughters, and a fire will burn up those who remain alive.

\v 24 They will come against you armed with chariots and wagons, and with a company of people!
\q They will set large shields, bucklers, and helmets against you all around!
\q And I will set justice before them and they will judge you with their judgments!
\v 25 For I will set my anger on you and they will deal with you in fury! They will cut off your nose and your ears, and your remnant will fall by the sword! 
They will take your sons and your daughters, so your posterity will be devoured by fire!
