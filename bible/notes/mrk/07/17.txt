\v 17 And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.
\v 18 And he says to them, Are you so without understanding also? Perceive you not, that whatever from without goes into
the man, it cannot defile him;
\v 19 because it goes not into his heart, but into his belly, and goes out into the draught?
This he said, making all meats clean.
