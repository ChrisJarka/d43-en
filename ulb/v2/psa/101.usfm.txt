\c 101
\d A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I will sing of lovingkindness and justice:
\q To thee, O Jehovah, will I sing praises.
\q
\v 2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way:
\q Oh when will you come to me?
\q I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
\q
\v 3 I will set no base thing before mine eyes:
\q I hate the work of them that turn aside;
\q It shall not cleave to me.
\q
\v 4 A perverse heart shall depart from me:
\q I will know no evil thing.
\q
\v 5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I destroy:
\q Him that has a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer.
\q
\v 6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me:
\q He that walks in a perfect way, he shall minister to me.
\q
\v 7 He that works deceit shall not dwell within my house:
\q He that speaks falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.
\q
\v 8 Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land;
\q To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.
