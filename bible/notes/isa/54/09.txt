\v 9 For this is as the waters of Noah to me; because as I swore that the waters of Noah would never again flood the
earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you nor rebuke thee.
\v 10 Though the mountains may fall and the hills be shaken, yet my lovingkindness will not depart from you, nor will
my covenant of peace be shaken, says Yahwah who has mercy on you.
