\p
\v 1 The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh under Eli. Yahweh's word was rare in those days; there was no
frequent prophetic vision.
\v 2 At that time, when Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see well,  was laying down in his own place. 
\v 3 The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was laying down to sleep, in the shrine ?of Yahweh, where the ark of God was.
\v 4 Yahweh called to Samuel: and he said, "Here I am."
