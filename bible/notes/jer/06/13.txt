\v 13 Everyone is trying to get money by tricking others,
\q2 from the the least important people to the most important people.
\q1 Even my prophets and priests, they all lie to get what they want.
\q1
\v 14 They act as though the sins of my people are like small wounds that they can easily treat.
\q They tell the people that everything will go well with them, but that is not true; things will not go well with them.
\q
\v 15 They should be ashamed about the disgusting things that they do, but they are not ashamed at all. They do not even know how to blush.
\q So, they also will be among those who will be killed. They will be destroyed when I punish them."

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 Yahweh declares that from the least to the greatest, all of them are greedy for dishonest gain.
\q From the prophet to the priest, all of them practice deceit.
\q
\v 14 They have healed the wounds of my people lightly, 
\q saying, 'Peace, Peace,' when there is no peace.
\q
\v 15 Were they ashamed when they practiced abominations? They were not ashamed; they did not know how to blush! 
\q So they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when they are punished, says Yahweh.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **that from the least to the greatest, all of them are greedy** - Here "the least" refers to the least powerful and least important people, and "the greatest" refers to the most powerful and most important people. These two phrases show that all the people of Israel are included in the phrase "all of them." AT: "all the them, including the least powerful, the most powerful, and every one else, are greedy" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **all of them** - "all of the people of Israel"
  * **are greedy for dishonest gain** - The abstract noun "gain" can be expressed with the phrases "get more money" or "get more things." AT: "want to get more money by lying to people" "strongly desire to get more things and will even trick people in order to get them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * **all of them practice deceit** - "all of them deceive people" or "all of them are liars"
  * **They have healed the wounds of my people lightly** - Possible meanings are 1) the wounds represent the problems the people have as a result of their sin. AT: "They act as though my people's problems are not serious, like small wounds" or 2) the wounds represent the people's sin. AT: "They acts as though my people's sins are not serious, like small wounds" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They have healed the wounds ... lightly** - Here "lightly" represents treating the wounds as if they were not serious, as if they were not difficult. [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **'Peace! Peace!' when there is no peace** - "'All is well! All is well!' but it is not well"
  * **Were they ashamed when they committed abominations?** - God uses this question to show his anger that they people were not ashamed of their sins. AT "They committed terrible sins, and they were not ashamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **they did not know how to blush** - When a person is ashamed, his face normally turns red. AT: "their faces did not even turn red"
  * **they will fall among the fallen** - Here "fall" represents being killed AT: "they will be killed along with the others who are killed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **they will be brought down when they are punished** - Here "will be brought down" represents being destroyed. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will destroy them when I punish them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
