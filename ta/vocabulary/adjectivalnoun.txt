====== Adjectival Noun ======

To understand Adjectival Noun, you need a basic understanding of ADJECTIVES and NOUNS; the general [[http://door43.org/en/ta/vocabulary/parts-of-speech?s[]=noun|English Structure ]]page will provide that foundation more fully.  In short, a noun is a person, place or thing.  An adjective describes a noun.  An ADJECTIVAL NOUN simply combines a noun with another noun that functions as an adjective.

===== Examples from English =====

An example is the quickest way to clarify.  A Bible teacher is an adjectival noun.  Both Bible and teacher are nouns; however in this context Bible is used to explain 'what kind of' teacher (e.g. a Bible teacher).  Some other examples include:  chariot race; church building; school bus.

Note:  an adjective may also be combined with an adjectival noun.  For example:  yellow school bus or wild chariot race.  Both of those examples add an adjective into the mix to further describe the noun.
