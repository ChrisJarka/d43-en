====== reveal, revelation ======

===== Definition: =====

Text

  * In the context of Galatians 1, Paul's revelation means that he received his knowledge about the person of Christ directly from Him, not being taught it by another person. Jesus revealed Himself, meaning Jesus appeared to him and spoke to him audibly. This is the same thing that John experienced as recorded in the book of Revelation. God's revelation in general refers to God showing that He exists, through His power being seen through the creation of the earth and stars.
