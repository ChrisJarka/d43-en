\v 10 And in this matter I give you advice, since this is profitable for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do something, but also to desire to do something.
\v 11 But now finish doing it also, so that as there was the eagerness and desire to do it, there also may be the completion according to your ability.
\v 12 For if the eagerness exists, it is acceptable based on what a man has, not by what he does not have.
