====== Proverbs 31 General Notes ======

=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapter 31 begins with 9 verses from King Lemuel. The last portion of this chapter is a poem about a capable wife.

== King Lemuel ==

This person is unknown in Scripture other than here. It is important to recognize that the words in this chapter are words of his mother addressed to him. They are formed like advice of a mother to her son. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Parallelism ==

Proverbs are often written without any surrounding context and in two lines of text. Each line will have a certain relationship to the other line. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Many of the proverbs are stated as promises or commands but they are intended to be advice.  

== An Acrostic Poem ==

Verse 10 through 31 is tightly formed as a poem in the original language. There are 22 couplets that each begin with a successive letter of the alphabet. However, each langauge will have a different set of letters and so it is important to realize this was a single composition with a single theme of a noble or capable wife. 

== Themes ==

There are individual proverbs that run along common themes: wise vs foolish, lazy vs diligent, money, truth telling, wicked vs righteous, sluggard, pride vs humility, integrity vs crookedness etc.
