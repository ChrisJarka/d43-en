    * **So it has been decreed **  - This means that it is something that will happen. Yahweh has said it would happen. 
      * **the queen is stripped** - The queens royal clothing is removed. The royal clothing represents her royal authority.  
      * **her female servants moan like doves** - "her" represents the queen of Assyria. The servants of this queen will mourn her loss of power, but do so quietly much like the cooing sound a dove makes. (See:[[en:ta:translate:simile
