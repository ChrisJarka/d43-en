<usfm>
\q
\v 8 They are all the same, they are brutish and stupid, disciples of idols that are nothing but wood.
\q
\v 9 They bring hammered silver from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz made by artificers,
\q the hands of refiners. Their clothes are blue and purple cloth. Their skillful men made all of these things.
\q
\v 10 But Yahweh is the true God. He is the living God and eternal king.
\q The earth quakes at his anger, and the nations cannot endure his anger.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They are all the same, they are brutish and stupid, disciples** - The words "brutish" and "stupid" mean basically the same thing and emphasize how foolish the people are for worshiping idols. AT: "They are all very stupid, they are disciples" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **disciples of idols that are nothing but wood** - "they try to learn from an idol which is just a piece of wood"
  * **Tarshish ... Uphaz** - places where silver and gold are mined
  * **gold from Uphaz made by artificers, the hands of refiners** - This can be stated in active form. Also, the refiners are represented here by their "hands" because they do their work with their hands. AT: "gold from Uphaz that artificers and refiners have made" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **artificers** - "skilled craftsmen"
  * **refiners** - "goldsmiths"
  * **Their clothes are blue and purple cloth** - "The people dress the idols in blue and purple cloth"
  * **The earth quakes at his anger** - This speaks of the earth shaking as an emotional response to Yahweh's anger, when actually Yahweh causes the earth to quake. AT: "The earth quakes when he is angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **quakes** - "shakes"
