\v 22 Furthermore, there is also another believer \add here\add* whom we are sending \add to you along with the two\add* men \add whom I have just mentioned\add*. Many times I have seen his good work \add for the Lord\add*, and I know that he is eager \add to serve the Lord\add*. Now, because he knows for sure that you \add want to give this gift the same as other believers do\add*, he is even more eager than he was before \add to go with the two other men\add*.
\v 23 As for Titus, \add I have chosen him because\add* he is my partner, and he has worked faithfully with me \add to help you\add*. As for the other two men, the congregations \add in this area\add* are sending them as their messengers. These two men honor Christ \add by everything they do\add*.
\v 24 So then, show them that you truly love \add others\add*, and \add in that way\add* help their congregations to understand \add why\add* we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are always saying such good things about you.

\v 22 And with these brothers we are sending to you, we add one more brother. He has proven to be faithful and serious in many ministries in which he has served, but he is important to this ministry because of the great trust he has in you.
\v 23 But especially take note of Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker. The other brothers are messengers from the churches, representing the churches, and they all represent Christ.
\v 24 So show these brothers your love and show them why we are spoke so highly of you, and why we could not stop telling all the churches how proud we are of you.
