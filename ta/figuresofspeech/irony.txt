====== Irony ======

Irony is a literary device/technique that is used to point out incongruous things. When the reality of something is opposite of the perception of it, one can say 'That is ironic!. Irony is typically used to be humorous or to place emphasis on the differences in something.

In irony, sometimes a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it.

===== Examples from English =====

**"The used-car salesman told me that this car was a great bargain at only $1000, so I bought it. But now I find out that the radiator doesn't work, and it will cost me $4000 to get it repaired. __Great bargain. Yeah, right__."** \\
In this example, the speaker uses irony to express that the reality of the car was totally different than what the car salesman said.

**"Thanks for holding the door open for me."** \\
This would be an ironic statement made to someone who did not hold the door open for for the speaker. It expresses that the other person should have been kind enough to hold it open, and that the speaker is annoyed with that person for not doing that.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”** Luke 22:64b (WEB)\\
The soldiers were hitting Jesus and they told him to prophecy and say who hit him. This was irony. They were implying that if he was a prophet, he should be able to tell who hit him, but they did not believe that he was a real prophet. They told him to prophecy because they were mocking him and wanted to prove that he was not really a prophet.

**When Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”** Mark 2:17a (WEB)\\
When Jesus spoke here of righteous people, that was irony. Jesus knew that there are no righteous people. But some people thought that they really were righteous, and they didn't think that Jesus should allow sinners to follow him. But Jesus invited sinners to go to him and turn from their sins. He was not inviting people who think they are righteous and do not need to turn from their sins.

**He said to them, “Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.** Mark 7:9 (WEB)\\
Instead of obeying God’s commands, the Pharisees and experts in the law had made up religious traditions that would be convenient, and would also make them appear to be righteous. Jesus used irony when he said that they "full well" rejected God's commands. They thought they were doing a good thing in following their traditions, and at first Jesus appeared to be praising them by saying "full well", but he was really rebuking them for rejecting God's commands.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * If the irony would be understood correctly, translate it as is.
  * If the irony would not be misunderstood, you could indicate that the thoughts are not truly those of the speaker but of someone else. For example, part of Mark 2:17 could be translated as "I have not come to call those who think they are righteous to repentance, but those who know they are sinners." Mark 7:9 could be translated as "You think you have done well in following your traditions. But you have rejected God's commandments."
