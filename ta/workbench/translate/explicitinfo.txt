==== Description ====

Sometimes translators need to make implicit information explicit because their readers would not understand the original speaker's or author's message.  

**Reason this is a translation issue**
  * Sometimes the words or grammar of the target language requires that certain information be stated explicitly.
  * Readers may not understand the message if they do not know certain information that the original speakers and hearers knew.
  * Readers might misunderstand the meaning of something because of differences between the Bible culture and their own.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

1. Sometimes the words or grammar of the target language requires that certain information be stated explicitly.

> Therefore, whether __you eat or drink__, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. (1 Corinthians 10:31 ULB) \\ 

Some languages require an object with the verbs "eat" and "drink." They need a word or phrase that tells what someone eats or drinks, even if it is not important what they ate or drank.

2. Readers may not understand the message if they do not know certain implicit information that the original speakers and hearers knew.

>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But it will be more tolerable for __Tyre and Sidon__ at the day of judgment than for you. (Matthew 11:22 ULB)

The people that Jesus was talking to knew that the people of Tyre and Sidon were very wicked, and that the day of judgment is a time when God will judge every person. They also believed that they themselves were righteous and did not need to repent. Today's readers need to know these things in order to understand that Jesus telling the people that they would be punished more severely because, though they saw the mighty deeds that Jesus did, they had not repented.

>Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not wash their hands when they eat__. (Matthew 15:2 ULB)

Modern readers could think the Pharisees were saying that the disciples should wash their hands before eating in order to keep from getting sick from germs on the hands. But for the Jews, washing the hands before eating was a ceremony that they practiced in order to be ritually clean. The elders had given them this tradition, and they believed that people had to follow all the traditions of the elders in order to be righteous. 

==== Translation Strategies ==== 

  - If the words or grammar of the target language requires certain information, then state that information clearly.
  - If readers would need to know certain implicit information in order to understand the message, then state that information clearly.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. If the words or grammar of the target language requires certain information, then state that information clearly.

  * **Therefore, whether __you eat or drink__, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.** (1 Corinthians 10:31 ULB) - Some languages require an object with the verbs "eat" and "drink." 
    * "Therefore, whether __you eat food or drink something__, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."

2. If readers would need to know certain implied information in order to understand the message, then state that information clearly.

  * **it will be more tolerable for __Tyre and Sidon__  at the day of judgment than for you**  (Matthew 11:22 ULB)
      * "God will punish __Tyre and Sidon, cities whose people you think of as very wicked,__  less severely than he will punish you"

  * **Jesus said to him, "Foxes __have holes__, and the birds of the sky __have nests__, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."**  (Matthew 8:20 ULB)
      * "Jesus said to him, "Foxes __have holes to live in__, and the birds of the sky __have nests to live in__, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head and sleep.""

  * **Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not wash their hands__  when they eat.**  (Matthew 15:2 ULB)
      * "Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For __they do not go through the ceremonial handwashing ritual__  when they eat."
