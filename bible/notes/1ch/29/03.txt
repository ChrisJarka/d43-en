\v 3 Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold
and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,
\v 4 even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, wherewith to
overlay the walls of the houses;
\v 5 of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the
things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made
by the hands of artificers. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Jehovah?
