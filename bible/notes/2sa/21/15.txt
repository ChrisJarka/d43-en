\v 15 And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the
Philistines. And David waxed faint;
\v 16 and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.
\v 17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware to
him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you quench not the lamp of Israel.
