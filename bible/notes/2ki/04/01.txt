\v 1 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is
dead; and you know that your servant did fear Jehovah: and the creditor is come to take to him my two children to be

\v 2 And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? tell me; what have you in the house? And she said, Your handmaid has
not anything in the house, save a pot of oil.
