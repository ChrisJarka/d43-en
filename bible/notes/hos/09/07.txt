===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 It is now the time for God to punish you;
\q2 the time has come in which God will pay you back for every sin you have committed.
\q2 And all you people of Israel must realize that these things will happen.
\q1 So your false prophets are fools,
\q2 and those who you thought were inspired by God are actually insane.
\q1 This is because you have sinned so much
\q2 and because you have become Yahweh's enemies.


\q1

===== Translation Notes: =====

Hosea the prophet is speaking.

  * **The days for punishment are coming; the days for retribution are coming**  - Hosea says these two similar phrases to emphasize that Yahweh will soon judge Israel for their evil deeds. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane**  - These phrases mean basically the same thing, and Hosea says them both for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **because of your great iniquity and great hostility**  - Hosea is emphasizing how much the people have sinned and rebelled against God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
