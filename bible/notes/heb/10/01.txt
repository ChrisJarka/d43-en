====== Hebrews 10:1-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Just like a shadow vaguely represents the thing that it is a shadow of, the laws that God \add gave Moses\add* only poorly represent \f + \ft metaphor \f* the good things that were to come later. Those laws were not all the good things themselves that God has promised. So, by offering the same kinds of sacrifices every year, people \f + \ft personification \f* who approach God can never become perfect\f + \ft Or: all that God intends them to be \f*.
\v 2 If God had removed the guilt for having sinned of those who brought the sacrifices, they would not feel that they were still guilty. So they would certainly have stopped offering those sacrifices!\f + \ft Or: would they not have stopped offering those sacrifices? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 3 But rather, the fact that they offer those sacrifices each year reminds them that they are still guilty for their sins.
\v 4 The principle is that blood of animals such as bulls or goats can never remove the guilt of those who have sinned.

\v 1 The Law does not show very well the good things that God will give us later. The Law is like a shadow of something else. If people come to worship God by offering the same kinds of sacrifices every year, they can never become perfect.
\v 2 If God had removed the guilt of those who brought these sacrifices, they would not feel that they were still guilty. So they would certainly have stopped offering those sacrifices!
\v 3 But rather, the fact that they offer those sacrifices each year reminds them that they are still guilty for their sins.
\v 4 So we know that even if we offer animals such as bulls or goats to God, even if he sees their blood flow, that will not stop us from being guilty.

\v 1 For the Law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not those realities themselves. The Law can never make perfect those who draw near to God by means of the same sacrifices that the priests continually offer year after year.
\v 2 Or else would not those sacrifices have ceased to be offered? In that case the worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more awareness of sins.
\v 3 But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins committed year after year.
\v 4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
