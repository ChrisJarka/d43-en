===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The one who will dash you to pieces** - The word "you" refers to Nineveh. Nahum speaks of an army or military leader destroying Nineveh as if he were to shatter Nineveh like one would shatter a clay pot. Translate this the same way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:nam:02:01|2:1]]. AT: "The one who will destroy you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **in their march** - The word "march" can be translated as a verb. AT: "as they march" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **The large shield is made ready to protect these attackers** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The attackers make ready the large shield to protect themselves" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The large shield** - This refers to a large cover that those who besieged a city would set up over themselves and their battering rams to protect themselves against the arrows and other projectiles with which the people in the city would attack them.
