<usfm> \v 14 And when I say to the wicked, “You will surely die!” but he repents from his sins and does what is just and right– \v 15 he restores the pledge of wickedness; he ceases from plunder! He walks in the statutes of the living and no longer commits iniquity!—he will surely live and not die! \v 16 None of the sins that he has sinned will be remembered concerning him. He has done justly and right and will surely live! </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **And when I say to the wicked .... and will surely live **- Alternate translation: "And suppose I tell some wicked people that they will surely die, but then they turn from their sins and do what is just and right.  For instance, they give back a loan, return what they have stolen, and obey my life-giving laws, no longer doing what is evil. If they do this, then they will surely live and not die.  None of their past sins will be brought up again, for they have done what is just and right, and they will surely live."  Notice the shift from singular (he/his/him) to plural (them/theirs/them) because
