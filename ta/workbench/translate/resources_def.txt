Sometimes you may not know what a word in the ULB means. The notes may have a definition or a description of the word or phrase to help you understand what they mean. 

==== Translation Notes Examples ====

Simple definitions of words or phrases are added without quotes or sentence format. Here are examples:

  * **marketplace**  - a large, open-air area where people would come to sell their goods
