\v 24 Yahweh says this: "Jehoiachin, son of King Jehoiakim of Judah, as surely as I am alive, \add I will punish you\add*. Even if you were the ring on my finger that shows that I am the king, I would pull you off.
\v 25 You are afraid of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his huge army, because they are wanting to kill you. I will enable them to capture you.
\v 26 I will expel you and your mother \add from this land\add*, and you will be taken to another country. Neither of you were born there, but you will both die there.

\v 24 As I live—this is Yahweh’s declaration—even if Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were the signet on my right hand, that I would wrench you off from it!
\v 25 For I have given you to the hand of the ones seeking your life and those before whom you are afraid, even the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans!
\v 26 So I will hurl you and your mother who bore you into another land where you were not born but where you will die.
