But that does not mean that God has abolished the laws that he established previously.

\v 16 The law and the prophets were until John.  From that time on, the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man enters forcibly into it.
\v 17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one small letter of the law to fall.
