===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **disturbed him greatly** – This means that the king felt very afraid and confused (because of what he had seen in the dreams). 
  * **his advisors** - These were men with special powers and knowledge who could sometimes tell what dreams meant. Some translations refer to them as, “wise men.” 
  * **meaning of the dreams** - People in Egypt believed that dreams were messages from the gods telling them about what would happen in the future. God used Pharaoh's dreams to tell him what would happen.
