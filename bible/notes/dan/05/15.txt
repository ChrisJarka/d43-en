<usfm>
\v 15 My wise men and men who work magic have tried to read the writing on this wall and tell me what it means, but are not able to do it.
\v 16 Someone told me that you can tell what dreams mean and explain things that are very difficult to understand. If you can read these words and tell me what they mean, I will give you a purple \add robe like I wear because I am the king\add*, and I will put a gold chain around your neck. You will become a very important official in my kingdom; there will be only two others who will be more important than you will be."

\v 15 Those men who were known for their wisdom and even those who claim to speak with the dead tried to read the writing on this wall and tell me what it means, but they could not do it.

<usfm>
\v 15 And now the men know for wisdom, those who claim to speak with the dead, have been brought in before me, to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they could make known the interpretation of it.
\v 16 But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing
and make its interpretation known to me, you shall be clothed with purple, and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will have the authority of the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
