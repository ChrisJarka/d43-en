==== Description ==== 
Most languages have a normal way of ordering the parts of a sentence. It is not the same in all languages. Translators need to know what the normal word order is in their language.

==== Parts of a Sentence ==== 

Most sentences have three basic important parts: subject, object, and verb. Subjects and objects are usually nouns (i.e., a person, place, thing, or idea). Verbs show action or a state of being.

=== Subject ===

  * The subject is usually what the sentence is about.
  * The subject is usually the main “actor.”
  * The subject usually performs some action or is being described.

A subject may be **active**: it does something, such as sing, or work, or teach.
  * __Peter__ sings the song well.

A subject can be in a **state**, such as being happy, sad, or angry.
  * __Peter__ is happy.

Or a subject may have something done to it.
  * __Peter__ was fed good food.

=== Object === 

The **object** is often the thing that the subject does something to. 
  * Peter hit __the ball__. 
  * Peter sings __the song__ well. 
  * Peter ate __good food__.

=== Verb === 


=== Preferred Word Order === 
All languages have a preferred word order. The examples below show the order of the subject, object, and verb in "Peter hit the ball" for some languages.

In some languages, such as English, the order is Subject-Verb-Object.
  * Peter hit the ball

In some languages the order is Subject-Object-Verb.
  * Peter the ball hit.

In some languages the order is Verb-Subject-Object.
  * Hit Peter the ball.



Translate sentences into your language so that they are accurate, clear, and natural.

=== Changes in Word Order ===
Word order can vary if the sentence:

  * is a question
  * contains descriptive words
  * contains a location
  * contains a time element
  * expresses a condition, such as the word “if”
  * is a poem

Sometimes the word order will also vary if there is a special type of emphasis. Perhaps, for example, in your language a rhetorical question or giving a command requires a certain word order. Knowing the preferred word order of the source text and how it is different from the target language can help. If the two languages have a different preferred word order, then the translator will need to rephrase the sentence to make the translation sound natural. The translator’s goal should always be to use natural language, making the meaning clear and accurate.
