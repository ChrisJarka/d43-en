\v 10 Abimelech asked Abraham, "What was your reason for doing this?"
\v 11 Abraham replied, "I said that because I thought, 'They will certainly not respect God in this place. If they don't respect God, they will not respect relationships with others. \add If I say she is my sister, they will try to pay me a bride price\add* to get her. But if I say she is my wife, they will kill me to get her.'
\v 12 Besides, she really \add can be considered\add* my sister, because she is the daughter of my father, although she is not the daughter of my mother. She is the daughter of another woman, and I married her.
