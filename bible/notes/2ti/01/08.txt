\v 8 So never be ashamed\f + \ft Or: reluctant \f* to tell others the message about our Lord. And do not \add be ashamed\add* of me, \add even though I am\add* a prisoner \add because I preach about\add* him. Instead, \add be willing to\add* suffer as I do as you proclaim the message about Christ. \add Endure what you will suffer\add* by letting God empower \add you to endure it\add*.
\v 9 \add God\add* saved us and chose us to conduct our lives in a pure way. It was not our doing good deeds\f + \ft Or: actions \f* \add that caused him to do this for usâ€”something\add* that we did not deserve. Instead, before time began\f + \ft Or: he created the world \f* he purposed, Or: planned to \add be kind to us\add* as a result of what Christ Jesus \add would do for us\add*.
\v 10 Now, as a result of our Savior Christ Jesus having come, it has been revealed \f + \ft Or:he has shown \f* \add that he acts kindly toward us. Specifically, Christ Jesus\add* has declared that we \add will not remain dead after we\add* die! He has also revealed that, as a result of \add our hearing and accepting\add* the message \add about Christ, we\add* will live \add forever in bodies that will\add* not decay!
\v 11 I was chosen \f + \ft Or:Christ chose me \f* to go as an apostle to many places and proclaim that message to people.

\v 8 So never be ashamed to tell others the message about our Lord. And do not be ashamed of me, even though I am a prisoner because I preach about him. Instead, be willing to suffer as I do as you proclaim the message about Christ. Endure what you will suffer by letting God empower you to endure it.    So do not be ashamed of the message of our Lord Jesus. And do not be ashamed of me, Paul. I am the Lord's prisoner, and in the power of God I struggle  to spread the good news. 

So do not think that you will have shame if you tell others about our Lord Jesus. And do not think you will have shame if you are my friend, because I am in prison because I trust in Jesus. Instead, be willing to suffer hardship as you tell others about the Good News. God will make you able to suffer all hardships .
\v 9 God saved us and chose us to conduct our lives in a pure way. It was not our doing good deeds he purposed, Or: planned to be kind to us as a result of what Christ Jesus would do for us.  God gave his plan and grace to us in Christ Jesus before time ever began.   He will do this, because he  saved us and called us to be his own people. God did not save us because of any good works we did ;  but he saved us because  he planned to give us this gift!  God caused the Messiah Jesus to pass this gift to us, even before the world began.
\v 10 Now, as a result of our Savior Christ Jesus having come, it has been revealed  that he acts kindly toward us. Specifically, Christ Jesus has declared that we will not remain dead after we die! He has also revealed that, as a result of our hearing and accepting the message about Christ, we will live forever in bodies that will not decay!    Now, through our Savior Jesus Christ, God has destroyed death, and through the gospel brought to light the reality of eternal life that never ends. 

Now everyone can see that God can save them, because our Savior the Messiah Jesus came and destroyed death and showed everyone the Gospel truth that he causes people to live forever.
\v 11 I was chosen  to go as an apostle to many places and proclaim that message to people. It was for this reason that God decided to send me to be an apostle, preacher, and teacher.

 I was chosen and sent as an apostle, missionary, and teacher.

\v 8 Then do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me, Paul, his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,
\v 9 who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own plan and grace, which He gave to us in Christ Jesus before times ever began;
\v 10 but now God's salvation has revealed by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who destroyed death, and brought life that never ends to light through the gospel,
\v 11  for which I was appointed a proclaimer, an apostle, and a teacher.
