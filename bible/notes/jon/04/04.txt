===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Is it good that you are so angry? -** God id using a rhetorical question to scold Jonah for being angry about something he should not be angry about. In some languages it is more natural to use a statement, "Your anger is not good." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **went out of the city -**  "left the city of Nineveh"
