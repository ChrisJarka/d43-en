===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - A new poem begins. The writer of Lamentations uses many different ways to express that the people of Israel have lost God's favor. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] â€‹and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 

  * **The Lord has covered the daughter of Zion under the cloud of his anger** - This speaks of the Lord's anger against Jerusalem as if it were a dark cloud. Possible meanings are 1) God is threatening to harm the people of Jerusalem or 2) God has already harmed the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the daughter of Zion ... the daughter of Judah** - These are poetic names for Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. Translate "the daughter of Zion" as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:lam:01:06|1:6]].(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **He has thrown the splendor of Israel down from heaven to earth** - This speaks of the people of Israel losing favor with the Lord as if he threw them out of his presence. The phrase "from heaven to earth" is a great distance used to represent how much they lost favor with the Lord. AT: "The splendor of Israel has lost all favor with the Lord" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the splendor of Israel** - This refers to Jerusalem. AT: "Jerusalem, the splendor of Israel" or "Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **not remembered** - This speaks of the Lord not paying attention to Jerusalem as if he did not remember them. AT: "disregarded," or "paid no attention to" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **He has not remembered his footstool** - This is a reference to the Lord having considered Jerusalem his "footstool" in the past, which symbolized that he had authority over them and that they were submissive to him. This speaks of the Lord disregarding Jerusalem as his footstool as if he did not remember them. AT: "He disregarded Jerusalem as his footstool" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **day of his anger ... the days of his anger** - Here "day" is used as an idiom that refers to a general period of time. AT: "at the time when he displayed his anger ... the time of his anger" or "at the time he acted in his anger ... the time of his anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **swallowed up** - This speaks of the Lord completely destroying the towns as if he were animal who ate them. AT: "completely destroyed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **all the towns of Jacob** - Here "Jacob" refers to the towns where his descendants lived. AT: "all the towns of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the fortified cities of the daughter of Judah** - Possible meanings are 1) the fortified cities throughout Judah, or 2) the fortified walls of Jerusalem.
