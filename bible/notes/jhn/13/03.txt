===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Verse 3 continues to tell us background information about what Jesus knew. The action in the story begins in verse 4. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])

  * **Jesus knew...the Father...he had come from God and was going back to God** - God the Son had always been with the Father, but he came to earth to be crucified for the sins of the world.
  * **Father** - This is an important title for God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **He rose from supper and laid down his outer clothing** - Because the region was very dusty, it was customary for the host of a dinner to provide a servant to wash the feet of the guests.
