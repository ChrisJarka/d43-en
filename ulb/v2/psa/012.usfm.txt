\c 12
\d For the Chief Musician; set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Help, Jehovah; for the godly man ceaseth;
\q For the faithful fail from among the children of men.
\q
\v 2 They speak falsehood every one with his neighbor:
\q With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak.
\q
\v 3 Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips,
\q The tongue that speaks great things;
\q
\v 4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail;
\q Our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
\q
\v 5 Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy,
\q Now will I arise, says Jehovah;
\q I will set him in the safety he panteth for.
\q
\v 6 The words of Jehovah are pure words;
\q As silver tried in a furnace on the earth,
\q Purified seven times.
\q
\v 7 You will keep them, O Jehovah,
\q You will preserve them from this generation for ever.
\q
\v 8 The wicked walk on every side,
\q When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
