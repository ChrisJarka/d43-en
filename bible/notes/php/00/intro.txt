=== What is the Book of Philippians about? ===

The Book of Philippians is a letter that the Apostle Paul wrote to the Christians in the area of Philippi, a city in Macedonia. The Philippians had sent Epaphroditus, one of their beloved church members, to take a gift to Paul in Rome and to help him. Epaphroditus planned to stay in Rome with Paul, but he became very ill. The Philippians had written Paul to ask about Epaphroditus; the Book of Philippians may have been Paul's reply. 

This letter also gave Paul the opportunity to write the Philippian church about matters of importance. He sent the letter to them by means of Epaphroditus.


=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Philippians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul's Letter to the Church in Philippi,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Philippi.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

 
===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What was the city of Philippi like?===

Philippi was founded by Philip, who was the father of Alexander the Great. The city was honored with special privileges of citizenship within the Roman Empire. This is why the idea of citizenship plays an important role in Paul's letter to the church there. He says that Christians have their "citizenship in heaven" (3:20).

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== Who does Paul mean as the "enemies of the cross of Christ" (3:18) in this letter? ===

The identity of this opposition is uncertain. Many options have been suggested but it appears from 3:19 that they were probably people who taught that having freedom in Christ meant that one could live however they desire to as Christians without consequences.

=== Why are the words "joy" and "rejoice" frequently used in this letter? ===

Paul is in prison when he writes this letter. People in prison are not typically happy about their conditions because prison is supposed to be a type of punishment. Despite his difficulties, Paul repeated explains that he is joyous and has reasons for rejoicing because of the grace of God shown through Jesus. These words are intended to convey shock about Paul's attitude and emotions. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Philippians? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of manuscripts that many believe are more accurate. The follow are the most significant issues in the Book of Philippians:

  * "rule, let us be of the same mind." (3:16) 

Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to the Book of Philippians.
