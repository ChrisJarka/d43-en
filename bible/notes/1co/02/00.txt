====== 1 Corinthians 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent 2:9 and the first line of 2:16, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Wisdom ==
Paul continues the discussion from the first chapter contrasting human and God’s [[:en:obe:kt:wise|wisdom]]. He says he did not try to convince them with wise sounding arguments but just told them about Christ being crucified for them. He also said the wisdom from the Holy Spirit is the only true wisdom. Human ideas are [[:en:obe:kt:foolish|foolish]]. Paul uses the phrase “hidden wisdom” in referring to truths that were not known before.
