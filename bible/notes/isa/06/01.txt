===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Seraphim** - The word for these creatures suggest that the creatures might have a fiery appearance or resemble snakes. Because we do not know exactly what the "seraphim" are, you could translate these as "creatures" or "living things" or "beings". (See: [[:en:ta:translate:translateunknowns]])
  * **each one had six wings** - "each seraph had six wings" or "each creature had six wings"
  * **with two each covered** - The words "wings" and "seraph" are left out of this phrase, but they are understood. Alternate translation "with two wings each seraph covered." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:ellipsis]])
  * **with two he covered his feet** - "with two wings each seraph covered his feet"
  * **with two he flew** - "with two wings each seraph flew"
