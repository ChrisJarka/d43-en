===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:**  - Verse 1 tells us where Jesus went at the end of the previous chapter.
  * **General Information:**  - The next part of the story begins in verse 2 as Jesus has returned to the temple.
  * **7:53 - 8:11**  - While some texts have these verses, the best and earliest texts do not include them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_textvariants|Textual Variants]])
  * **all the people**  - This is an exaggeration to emphasize that a very large number of people came to Jesus. AT: "many people." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole|Hyperbole]])
  * **The scribes and the Pharisees brought**  - Here the phrase "the scribes and the Pharisees" is a synecdoche that represents some of the members of these two groups. AT: "Some men who taught the Jewish laws and some who were Pharisees." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **a woman caught in the act of adultery**  - This is a passive statement. You may translate it in an active form. AT: "a woman that they had found committing adultery." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
