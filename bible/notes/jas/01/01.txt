===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **James** - “From James.” Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. This could be translated as “I, James, wrote this letter.” This James is not the brother of John, a disciple of Jesus. The author of this letter is James the half-brother of Jesus.
  * **a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ** - The phrase “I am” is implied (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]]). You could make it clearer with a new sentence: “I am a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.”
  * **to the twelve tribes** - "I am writing to the twelve tribes." Your language may have a particular way of introducing the one receiving the letter. 
  * **twelve** - "12" (See: [[en:ta:translate:translateunknowns-numbers]])
  * **of the Dispersion **- "living in many different places." James uses the word "dispersion" to refer to Jewish believer in Jesus who do not live in the land of Israel. 
  * **greetings** - "hello"
  * **Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you experience various troubles** - "My fellow believers, think of all your different kinds of troubles as something to celebrate"
  * **knowing that the testing of your faith works endurance** - "because you know that these troubles make your faith stronger"
