===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 8 Those who never behave sinfully are deceiving themselves, and refusing to believe what God says about them. \v 9 But God always does what he says he will do, and what he does is always right. So if we admit to him that we have behaved sinfully, he will forgive us for our sins and will free us from the guilt of everything we have done wrong. Because of that, we should admit to him that we have behaved sinfully. \v 10 Because God says that everyone has sinned, those who say that they have never behaved sinfully talk as though God lies! They reject what God says about us! </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. \v 9 But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. \v 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. </usfm>
