\v 25 Regarding the question about those who have never married, I will give my views, but I have no specific commandment from the Lord on this question. But you can have confidence in my reply because, by the Lord's mercy, he confirms my trustworthiness in these matters.
\v 26 Therefore, because of the difficult times that seem to be coming upon us all, I think it is good for you to remain as you where when God called you.
