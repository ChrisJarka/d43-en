===== Description =====

The Hebrew calendar used in the Bible has twelve months. Unlike the western calendar, its first month, Abib, begins  in the spring of the northern hemisphere. Sometimes a month is called by its name (Abib, Ziv, Sivan), and sometimes it is called by its order in the calendar year (first month, second month, third month).
