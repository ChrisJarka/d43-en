====== day of the Lord, day of Yahweh ======

===== Description: =====

The phrase "day of the Lord" or "day of Yahweh" refers to a time when there will be a final judgment of all who have rebelled against God. The resurrection of the righteous and the unrighteous will also happen at this time.

  * The "day of Yahweh" in the Old Testament means the same as the "day of the Lord" in the New Testament.
  * The word "day" in "day of the Lord" ("day of Yahweh") probably refers to a "time" or "occasion" that is longer than 24 hours. It begins when the Lord appears to judge sinners, and continues until God firmly and permanently establishes his rule over all creation.
  * This final time of judgment and resurrection on the day of the Lord is also known as the "last day". For example, Jesus promised his followers that he would raise them to life "on the last day".
  * The Bible sometimes uses the term "day of the Lord" to refer to other times of judgment that have some of the characteristics of the final judgment, such as the invasions of Jerusalem by Babylon and Rome.
===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Depending on the context, other ways to translate "day of the Lord" could include, "time of the Lord" or "time when the Lord Jesus will return to judge sinners."
  * "Day of the Lord" can also be translated as "day of Christ," "time of Yahweh," "day of Jesus."
