\c 22
\p
\v 1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a
sheep.
\v 2 If the thief be found breaking in, and be struck so that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him.
\v 3 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him; he shall make restitution: if he have nothing, then
he shall be sold for his theft.
\v 4 If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall pay double.
\p
\v 5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man’s field;
of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.
\p
\v 6 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; he
that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
\p
\v 7 If a man shall deliver to his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief be
found, he shall pay double.
\v 8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near to God,
to see whether he have not put his hand to his neighbor’s goods.
\v 9 For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment,
or for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith, This is it, the cause of both parties shall come before God; he
whom God shall condemn shall pay double to his neighbor.
\p
\v 10 If a man deliver to his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven
away, no man seeing it:
\v 11 the oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, whether he has not put his hand to his neighbor’s goods; and the owner
thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.
\v 12 But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution to the owner thereof.
\v 13 If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness: he shall not make good that which was torn.
\p
\v 14 And if a man borrow anything of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely
make restitution.
\v 15 If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be a hired thing, it came for its hire.
\p
\v 16 And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife.
\v 17 If her father utterly refuse to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
\p
\v 18 You shall not suffer a sorceress to live.
\p
\v 19 Whosoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 20 He that sacrifices to any god, save to Jehovah only, shall be utterly destroyed.
\v 21 And a sojourner shall you not wrong, neither shall you oppress him: for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
\v 22 You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
\v 23 If you afflict them at all, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry;
\v 24 and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children
fatherless.
\p
\v 25 If you lend money to any of my people with you that is poor, you shall not be to him as a creditor; neither shall you
lay upon him interest.
\v 26 If you at all take your neighbor’s garment to pledge, you shall restore it to him before the sun goes down:
\v 27 for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? And it shall come to pass, when he
cries to me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.
\p
\v 28 You shall not revile God, nor curse a ruler of your people.
\v 29 You shall not delay to offer of your harvest, and of the outflow of your presses. The firstborn of your sons shall you
give to me.
\v 30 Likewise shall you do with your oxen, and with your sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth
day you shall give it me.
\v 31 And you shall be holy men to me: therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; you shall cast
it to the dogs.
