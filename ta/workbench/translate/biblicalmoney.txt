//This page answers the question: How can I translate the terms for money that are in the Bible?//

==== Description: ====

The following terms are some of the most well-known units of money that are used in the Bible. Unless otherwise noted, these are the units of money used only by the Hebrew people.

[Note: In the Old Testament, the "shekel" referred to a type of weight (made of gold, silver, bronze, brass or iron) that was used for money and trade. In the New Testament, a "shekel" was a type of silver coin.]

  * shekel
      * In the Old Testament (11 grams weight of various materials)
      * In the New Testament (Jewish silver coin = 4 days' wages)
  * talent
      * In the Old Testament (33 kilograms weight of various materials)
      * In the New Testament (weight measurement of Roman or Greek silver = 6000 days' wages)
  * daric (Persian coin made of gold or silver)
  * denarius (Roman silver coin = one day's wages; plural= denarii)
  * drachma (Greek silver coin = one day's wages)

=== Translation Principles ===

  - Using the Bible terms can show that the Bible is true and that people actually used these types of money during that time period.
  - Do not use modern money values since these change from year to year. Using them will cause the Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate.

==== Translation Strategies ====

  - Keep the Bible term and spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate]])
  - Describe the value of the money in terms of its weight.
  - Describe the value of he money terms of what people in Bible times could earn in a day's work.
  - Use the Bible term and give the equivalent amount in the text or a note.
