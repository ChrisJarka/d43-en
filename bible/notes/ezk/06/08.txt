\v 8 Yet will I leave a remnant, in that you shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when you shall be scattered
through the countries.
\v 9 And those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captive, how that I have
been broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the harlot after their idols:
and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
\v 10 And they shall know that I am Jehovah: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.
