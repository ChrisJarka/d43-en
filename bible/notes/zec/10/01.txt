\v 1 Ask Yahweh to cause rain to fall in the springtime\f + \ft Or: before the hot season starts \f*,
\q2 because he is the one who makes the clouds \add from which the rain falls\add*.
\q1 He causes showers to fall on us,
\q2 and he causes crops to grow well in the fields.

\v 2 What people think that the idols in their houses suggest is only nonsense,
\q2 and people who \add say that they can\add* interpret dreams tell only lies.
\q1 When they tell people things to comfort them, what they say is useless,
\q2 so the people \add who consult\f + \ft Or: trust in \f* them\add* are like lost sheep;
\q1 they are attacked because they have no \add one to protect them \add*
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a shepherd \add protects his sheep\add*.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Ask you of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain, even of
Jehovah that makes lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.
\v 2 For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in
vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.
