<usfm>
\v 18 And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed
to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among
all the nations whither I have driven them;
\v 19 because they have not listened to my words, says Jehovah, wherewith I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising
up early and sending them; but you would not hear, says Jehovah.
