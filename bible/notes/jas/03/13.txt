\v 13 If any of you thinks that you are wise and know much, you should always act in a good way to show people that your good deeds are the result of your being truly wise. Being wise helps us to act gently toward others.
\v 14 But if you are very envious of other people and lie against them and do them wrong, you should not pretend that you are wise. By boasting like that you are saying that what is true is actually false.

\v 13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let that person show a good life by his works in the humility of wisdom.
\v 14 But if you have bitter jealousy and ambition in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who is wise and understanding among you?** - James uses this question to teach his audience about proper behavior. The words "wise" and "understanding" are similar. AT: "I will tell you how a wise and understanding person is to act." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Let that person show a good life by his works in the humility of wisdom** - This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "humility" and "wisdom." AT: "That person should live a good life by doing the kind of deeds that come from being humble and wise" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **if you have bitter jealousy and ambition in your heart** - The word "heart" refers to emotions or thoughts. This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "jealousy" and "ambition." AT: "if you are jealous and selfish" or "if you desire what other people have and you want to succeed even if it harms others" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **do not boast and lie against the truth** - The abstract noun "truth" can be stated as "true." AT: "do not boast that you are wise, because that is not true" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
