====== incense ======


===== Definition: =====


Incense refers to a mixture of fragrant spices that when burned produce smoke that has a pleasing smell. These spices are made from parts of plants that are beaten into tiny pieces.


    * In the Bible, the incense was made from mixing equal amounts of five specific spices that God had told the Israelites to burn for an incense offering. They had to follow his instructions exactly for making this mixture.
    * There was a special golden altar used only for burning the incense.
    * The incense was offered at least four times a day at each hour of prayer.
    * In addition, incense was burned every time a burnt meat offering was made.
    * The burning of incense represents prayer and worship rising up to God from his people.


One way to translate "incense" would be, "fragrant spices" or, "good-smelling plants."
