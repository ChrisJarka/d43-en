\v 16 To those who  \add are on the way to hell, our message is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a foul smell  \add because it is about dying\add* and being separated from God forever. But, to those\add on the way to heaven, the message that we teach is like\add* a pure fragrant smell, \add because we tell them\add* that they will live  \add forever with God. As we think about that, we think\add* no one can have enough ability  \add to do\add* such important work  \add for God!\add*\f + \ft Or: how can anyone have enough ability  \add to do\add* such important work  \add for God\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 17  \add But perhaps God considers us\f + \ft exclusive \f* sufficient\add*, because we do not work\f + \ft Or: act \f* like so many  \add others whom you know\add*. They teach God's message in a way that  \add they think people will like, and they think that\add* people will pay them for teaching that way. We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f* certainly do not do that\add*. On the contrary, \add as servants of\add* Christ, and knowing that God is watching us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, we teach sincerely  \add the message that\add* God sent us to proclaim.

\v 16 To those God does not save, that aroma of Christ, smells to them like something coming from death and taking them to death. But to those God is saving, it is the sweet aroma of Christ coming through life and taking people to life. Who deserves to think of such wonders!
\v 17  You know that many are selling the word of God for money, but we are not like them. We labor to please God, to do what he wants. And we speak about Christ in the way we do, because God sees everything we do, and we speak because we are joined to Christ.

\v 16 To the ones who are perishing, it is an aroma from death to death. To the ones being saved, it is an aroma from life to life. Who is worthy of these things?
\v 17 For we are not like so many, peddling the word of God, but with purity of motives, as sent from God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.
