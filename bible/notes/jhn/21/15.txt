===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Jesus said to Simon Peter... do you love me** - In the original language there are multiple words  which mean "love" which are present here. Both times the  word "love" which Jesus asks if Peter has is "God's love." this "love" is unselfish, sacrificial, and focused on the good of others. The same word can be used to describe when people love God and and when they love other people in this unselfish way.
    * **Peter said... I love you.** - In the original language there are multiple words which mean "love." Both times the word rendered as "love" here by Peter is "brotherly love” or “love for a friend or family member.” This is natural human love between friends or relatives. 
    * **“Feed my lambs.”**  - This reference is pertaining to the people who have come to believe in Jesus.  Alternate translation "Feed the people that also love me." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
    * **“Tend my sheep.”**  - Alternate translation "Care for the people that also love me." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
