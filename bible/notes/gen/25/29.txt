\v 29 One day while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came home from the field, very hungry.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Since this is the beginning of a story about something that happened one time, some translators may want to start it with a phrase like "One day" as the UDB does.

  * **cooked some stew**  - "boiled some food" or "cooked some soup." This stew was made of boiled lentils. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:gen:25:31|25:34]])
  * **he was weak from hunger**  - Alternate translations: "he was very hungry" or "he was weak because he was very hungry"
  * **I am exhausted**  - "I am weak from hunger." Alternate translation: "I am starving." 
  * **Edom**  - Translators may add a footnote that says "The name Edom means 'red.'"
