\v 10 according as each has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;
\v 11 if any man speaketh, speaking as it were oracles of God; if any man ministereth,
ministering as of the strength which God supplieth: that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, whose is the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
