\v 1 They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another manâ€™s, will he return to her again? will
not that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, says Jehovah.
\v 2 Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see; where have you not been lain with? By the ways have you sat for them,
as an Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your whoredoms and with your wickedness.
