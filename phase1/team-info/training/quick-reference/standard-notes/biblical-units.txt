====== Biblical units ======

===== Definition: =====

We have Important Term page for the major categories of Biblical units. However, if we link them in the Important Terms section, the general title will appear rather than the title of the individual unit (cubit, denarius, etc.). Therefore, we suggest that the unit be included in a note, followed by the link to the appropriate term page.
