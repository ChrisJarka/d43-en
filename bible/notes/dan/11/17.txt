\v 17 And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions; and he shall
perform them: and he shall give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she shall not stand, neither be for him.
\v 18 After this shall he turn his face to the isles, and shall take many: but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by
him to cease; yea, moreover, he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him.
\v 19 Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.
