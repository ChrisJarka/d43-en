======  Matthew 20 General Notes ======




=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Hypothetical Situation ==
Jesus uses a hypothetical situation ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:20:01|20:1-16]]) to show a young man the true nature of his heart. It is unlikely that he was commanding this boy to sell everything because this is needed for anyone to be "perfect." This is also used in reference to the subject of divorce and the rich man entering into the kingdom of heaven.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Paradox ==

This is a statement that  seems absurd or appears to contradict itself. For example, "whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it" ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:16:24|16:24-28]])
