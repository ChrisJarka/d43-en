===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 If people are building a house without \add knowing whether\add* it is Yahweh's \add will to build it\add*,
\q2 they are building it in vain.
\q1 Similarly, if Yahweh does not protect a city,
\q2 it is useless for guards\f + \ft Or: sentries \f* to stay awake \add to tell people if their enemies come to attack it\add*.
\q1
\v 2 It is also useless to arise very early and go to sleep late at night
\q2 in order that you can work hard \add all day\add* to \add earn money to buy\add* food,
\q1 because Yahweh gives food to those whom he loves.
\b
\q1

\v 1 Except Jehovah build the house,
\q They labor in vain that build it:
\q Except Jehovah keep the city,
\q The watchman wakes but in vain.
\q
\v 2 It is vain for you to rise up early,
\q To take rest late,
\q To eat the bread of toil;
\q For so he gives to his beloved sleep.
