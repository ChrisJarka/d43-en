===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **However** - "Just to prove that Jesus was truly dead,"
  * **pierced his side**  - The word "pierce" in this verse means to thrust a spear, javelin, sword, or any such weapon through a person's body.
  * **out came blood and water** - This was proof that Jesus' heart and lungs had stopped working, and proved Jesus' death.
  * **The one who saw this** - Verse 35 is separate from the story. The writer (John the apostle) is telling us that he was there and we can trust what he wrote.
  * **has borne witness**  - The writer (John the apostle) affirms that he is telling the truth about what he has seen. Alternate translation: "is describing what he saw"
