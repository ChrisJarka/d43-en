\p
\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.
\v 2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before
the children of Israel.
\v 3 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and
made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
