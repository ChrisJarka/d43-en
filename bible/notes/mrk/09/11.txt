\v 11 And they asked him, saying, How is it that the scribes say that Elijah must first come?
\v 12 And he said to them, Elijah indeed comes first, and restoreth all things: and how is it written of the Son of man,
that he should suffer many things and be set at nought?
\v 13 But I say to you, that Elijah is come, and they have also done to him whatever they would, even as it is written of
him.
