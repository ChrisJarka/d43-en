<usfm> \p
\v 16 Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 17 "Son of man, when the Israelite people were living in their own land, they defiled it by the things that they did. I considered that their behavior was disgusting, like the rags that women use during their monthly menstrual periods.
\v 18 So I severely punished them, because they had murdered many people and because they had defiled the land by worshiping idols there. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p
\v 16 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said, 
\v 17 â€œSon of man, when the house of Israel inhabited their land, they defiled it with their ways and their deeds. Their ways were like the unclean menstruation of a woman before me.
\v 18 So I poured out my fury against them for the blood that they poured out upon the land and their pollution of it by their idols! </usfm>
