\c 3

\v 1 And the word of Jehovah came to Jonah the second time, saying,
\v 2 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the preaching that I command thee.
\v 3 So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three
days’ journey.
\v 4 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
overthrown.
\v 5 And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even
to the least of them.
\v 6 And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him
with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
\v 7 And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man
nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water;
\v 8 but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily to God: yea, let them turn every
one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.
\v 9 Who knows whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
\v 10 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do
to them; and he did it not.
