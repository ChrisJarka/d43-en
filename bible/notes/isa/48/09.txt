===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 But, for my own sake, in order that I will be honored,
\q2 I will not punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* you immediately
\q2 and I will not completely get rid of you.
\q1
\v 10 I have purified you, but not the way \add people refine\add* silver.
\q1 Instead, I have caused you to suffer very much \add to get rid of your impure behavior\add*
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add people put metal in a very hot\add* furnace \add to get rid of the impurities\add*.
\q1
\v 11 But for my \f + \ft metonymy \f* own sake I will delay punishing you more;
\q1 I will do it for my own sake
\q2 in order that my reputation will not be damaged \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\q1 I will not allow any \add person or any idol\add* to be honored as I \add deserve to be\add* honored."

<usfm>
\v 9 For my reputation will I defer my anger, and for my honor  I will hold  back from destroying you.
\v 10 Look I  refined you, but not as silver; I have purified you in the furnace of affliction.
\v 11 For my own sake alone I will act; for how can I allow
my name to be defiled? I will not give my glory to anyone else.
