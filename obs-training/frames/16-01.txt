{{:en:obs:obs-16-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After **[[:en:obe:other:joshua|Joshua]]** died, the **[[:en:obe:other:israel|Israelites]]** **[[:en:obe:other:disobey|disobeyed]]** **[[:en:obe:kt:god|God]] and did not drive out the rest of the [[:en:obe:other:canaan|Canaanites]] or [[:en:obe:other:obey|obey]] [[:en:obe:kt:gods-law|God's laws]]**. The Israelites began to **[[:en:obe:kt:worship|worship]]** the Canaanite **[[:en:obe:kt:god-false|gods]]** instead of **[[:en:obe:kt:yahweh|Yahweh]]**, **the [[:en:obe:kt:true|true]] God**. The Israelites had no **[[:en:obe:other:king|king]]**, so everyone did **what they thought was right for them**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **and did not drive out** – This tells how they disobeyed God, so in some languages it may be better to start this as a new sentence, “They did not.” 
  * **drive out the rest of the Canaanites** - This can be translated, "fight with the rest of the Canaanites to force them to leave the land.” 
  * **or obey God's laws** - This means that the people also disobeyed the laws that God gave to the Israelites at Mount Sinai.
  * **the true God** - That is, “the only real God.” Yahweh is the only one that people should worship. 
  * **what they thought was right for them** – This means that they all did whatever they wanted to do, including many evil things.
