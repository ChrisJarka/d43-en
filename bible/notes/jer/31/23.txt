\v 23 Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Again, say this word in the land of Judah and in its cities when I restore their fortunes, “Yahweh has blessed you, 
righteous habitation, holy mountain
\v 24 For Judah and its cities will abide within you together! Also husbandmen will go forth with flocks.
\v 25 Since I will give the weary soul water to drink, and I will fill every languishing soul.”’”
\v 26 After this I awoke, and I saw my sleep was pleasant to me.
