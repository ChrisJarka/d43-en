\v 31 Jesus also told this parable: "The \add number of\add* (OR\add , God's influence in the lives of\add*) \add people whose\add* lives God rules over \add will continue to grow. It is very much\add* like mustard seeds grow after a man plants them in his field.
\v 32 Although mustard seeds are among the smallest of all the seeds\add that people plant, here in Israel they become large plants. When the plants have fully grown, they are larger than the other garden plants. They become shrubs that are large enough for the birds to build nests in their branches."\add*

\v 31 Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took,
and sowed in his field:
\v 32 which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the
birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.
