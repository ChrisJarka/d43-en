<usfm>
\v 17 When the sun had set and it had become dark, unexpectedly a blazing torch and a clay pot containing burning coals from which smoke was rising appeared and went between the halves of the animals.
\v 18 On that day Yahweh made an agreement with Abram. Yahweh told him, "I will give to your descendants all the land between the river that is on the eastern border of Egypt to the south, and north to the huge Euphrates River.
\v 19 That is the land where the Ken, the Keniz, the Kidmon,
\v 20 the Heth, the Perez, the Repha,
\v 21 the Amor, the Canaan, the Girgash, and the Tebus people-groups live."
