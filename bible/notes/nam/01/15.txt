===== translationNotes: =====

  * **on the mountains there are the feet of someone who is bringing good news** - Here the word "feet" represent the person who is running in order to declare a message. AT: "on the mountains there is someone who is bringing good news" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **wicked one ... he** - Nahum refers to the people of Nineveh as though they were one person.
  * **he is completely cut off** - Nahum speaks of the people of Nineveh being completely destroyed as if they had been cut off, like a person would cut a branch from a tree. This can be stated in active form. AT: "he is completely destroyed" or "Yahweh has completely destroyed him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
