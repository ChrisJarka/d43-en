\v 9 Moses wrote in one of those laws, "While an ox is threshing\add grain\add*, you must not tie its mouth shut \add so that it cannot eat the grain\add*." God was not only concerned about oxen \add when he gave that law\add*.\f + \ft Or: Was God \add only\add* concerned about oxen \add when he gave that law\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 10 \add No\add*, he was \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* concerned about us, also! Yes, \add God caused Moses to\add* write those words \add because he is concerned\add* about us! Those who plow the ground confidently expect \add to eat some of\add* the crop \add that grows\add*. Those who thresh grain confidently expect \add to eat some of the grain that they thresh. Similarly, we who proclaim the message about Christ have the right to confidently expect to receive financial help for our work\add*.
\v 11 And because we have proclaimed God's message to you, we certainly have the right to receive from you the things that we need for our bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f*!\f + \ft Or: do we not have the right to receive from you the things that we need for our bodies? \f* \f + \ft metaphor, rhetorical question \f*

\v 9 For it is written in the law of Moses, "Do not muzzel an ox while it is treading out the grain." But God is concerned about a much more important principle that the care of an ox, isn't he?
\v 10 He is writing most certainly about us, and not just about an ox. Moses is saying that those who plow and those who thresh should both have hope of sharing in the harvest.
\v 11 If we have sown spiritual blessings among you, and that was our labor on your behalf, would it be unreasonable for us to reap the material blessings that came from the harvest, from you?

<usfm>
\v 9 For it is written in the Law of Moses, "Do not muzzle an ox when it treading out the grain." Is it really the oxen that God cares about?
\v 10 Is he not speaking most certainly about us? It was written for us, because the one who plows should plow with hope, and he who threshes should thresh in hope of sharing in the harvest.
\v 11 If we sowed spiritual things among you, is it too much for us to reap material things from you?
