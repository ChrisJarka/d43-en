===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **In the meantime** - This phrase indicates this verse is happening at the same time as the previous verse. 
    * **"I have food to eat that you do not know about."**  - Jesus explains this in verse 34 as "My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work".
    * **No one else could have brought him something to eat, could they?**  - This question suggests that it was impossible for someone to have brought Jesus food and then asks for confirmation. Another way of putting it, “Could somebody else have possibly brought him something to eat?”
