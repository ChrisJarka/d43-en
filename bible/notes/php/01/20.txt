====== Philippians 01:20-21 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 I \add know that this will happen\add* because I very confidently expect \f + \ft doublet \f* that in no way I will be reluctant \add to honor Christ\add*. Instead, just like I always \add have done\add*, Christ will be greatly honored \f + \ft Or:I will continue now also to very boldly honor Christ \f* by means of all that I do \f + \ft synecdoche, metonymy \f*, whether by \add the way I\add* live or \add by the way I\add* die.
\p
\v 21 As for me, I live \add in order to honor\add* Christ. But if I die, it will be better \add for me than if I continue to live, because then I will be completely united with him\add*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 I eagerly and confidently expect that in no way will I fail to do what I should do. Instead, I will have courage now, just as in the past. I will honor Christ with my body, whether I live or die.
\p
\v 21 As for me, I live to honor Christ. But if I die, it will be even better for me.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 It is according to my eager expectation and certain hope that I will not be at all ashamed, and yet with all boldness, now as always, Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.
\v 21 For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

===== translationNotes: =====


  * *It is according to my eager expectation and certain hope** - Here the phrases "eager expectation" and "certain hope" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize how strong his expectation is. AT: "I am completely convinced" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **and yet with all boldness, now as always, Christ will be exalted** - This is part of Paul's expectation and hope. AT: "but I expect and hope that with all boldness, now as always, Christ will be exalted"
  * **with all boldness, now as always, Christ** - "I will be very bold now, as I always have been, and Christ"
  * **Christ will be exalted in my body** - The phrase "my body" is a metonym for what Paul does with his body. This can be stated in active form. Possible meanings are 1) "I will honor Christ by what I do" or 2) "people will praise Christ because of what I do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **whether by life or by death** - "if I go on living or if I die"
  * **For to me** - These words are emphatic. They indicate that this is Paul's personal experience.
  * **to live is Christ** - Here pleasing and serving Christ is spoken of as Paul's only purpose for living. AT: "to go on living is an opportunity to please Christ" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **to die is gain** - Here death is spoken of as "gain." Possible meanings for "gain" are 1) Paul's death will help spread the message of the gospel or 2) Paul will be in a better situation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
