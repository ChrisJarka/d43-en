\v 16 For this cause it is by faith that it be according to grace, in order for the promise to be sure to all the descendants. Not only to the one from the law, but to the one who is from the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.
\v 17 (As it is written, "I have made you a father of many nations") in the presence of him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that do not exist into existence.
