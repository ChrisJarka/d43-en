====== Publishing Workflow - Detailed ======

Notes: 
  * Colors
    * Red/Orange is computer/automated (or will be)
    * Green is performed by uW staff
    * Blue is performed by the submitter 
  * Shapes
    * Double circle signifies a check
    * Rectangle signifies a form
    * Arrows are actions
  * Numbers
    * Most numbers have no significance (e.g. server1, server2, server3 all refer to the same server) but have been used to simplify the chart
