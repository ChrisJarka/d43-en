====== Appropriate Level and Style ======

These are questions that will help determine whether or not the translation has been done in a style that is acceptable to the intended audience.

Q? Is the translation written in a way that can be understood easily by both young and old members of the language community? (Whenever someone speaks, they can change their choice of words for either a younger or an older audience. Is this translation done using words that suit a wide variety of people?)

Q? Is the style of this translation more formal or informal? (Is the manner of speaking appropriate for the local audience?)
