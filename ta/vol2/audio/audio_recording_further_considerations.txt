===== Further Considerations =====

//This page answers the question:// //What are further considerations for recording?//

Over time the recording team should develop a good rhythm to the process, a sense of how long of a section to record and many other things that make a recording project flow well. In addition, the following ideas are worth considering to help the recording process.

  * Begin your day of work with time spent in prayer as a recording team. The recording is not so important or so urgent that there is no time to spend a few minutes with the Lord as a team.
  * Don't push too hard in recording. When it is evident that taking a break will help the team recharge, take a short break.
  * A happy team will be more productive and work in much better unity together, which is really valuable when faced with difficult recording circumstances or passages. Discover how to enjoy working together and valuing each other. It will help greatly.
  * Some passages will be more difficult to narrate due to the phrasing or the presence of Proper Names or unusual words. Do not hesitate to make those difficult areas into smaller sections for recording. Struggling through long sections of difficult reading can be discouraging and there is no reason to do that. Instead, gain confidence and momentum by breaking the difficult passages into small pieces to record.
  * Have the narrator preview the text before the recording session begins. This will give the narrator an opportunity to consider how to read certain passages properly, perhaps even making notes on when to pause, which passages to read as smaller sections, etc.
  * Some passages will have unfamiliar Proper Names or words that are more complicated to pronounce. Take time to identify them and determine the proper pronunciation in advance of recording. Pronunciation guides are available in some languages and the narrator or checker can make notations to aid the narrator in proper pronunciation during the recording.

//One last tipâ€¦.// Save your work often. Don't wait to save your progress until you reach the end of a story or chapter. Otherwise, you could lose a lot of hard earned progress if the file is not saved when the recordist makes a serious error, the electricity goes off or a software program crashes.
