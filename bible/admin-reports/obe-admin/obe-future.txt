====== OBE: Future Tasks ======

This is a page for tracking OBE tasks that we want to do after the initial drafting of the terms is complete. Please use a bold title for each and provide a short explanation.

==== Task List: ====

**Update Bible References** - Remove tags to less important passages and make sure the most important references for the term are included in the list.

**Remove excess KT links** - Thin down the number of KT links in a passage so that "regular" terms only appear once per story/narrative, allowing the more important terms to stand out in the list.

**Update cross-links** - check that newer terms are cross-linked as needed to older pages.

**Create kings pages** - create "generic" pages with chronological lists of kings for Israel, Judah, etc. and cross-link to the KT pages for the individual kings.
