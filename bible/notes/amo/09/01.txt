\c 9
\p
\v 1 I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said, "Strike the tops of the pillars so that the foundations will shake.
\q Break them in pieces on all of their heads,
\q and I will kill the last of them with the sword.
\q Not one of them will get away,
\q not one of them will escape.
\q
\v 2 Though they dig into Sheol,
\q there my hand will take them.
\q Though they climb up to heaven,
\q there I will bring them down.

===== translationNotes: =====
  * **General Information:** - Yahweh shows Amos another vision.

  * **Strike the tops ... Break them** - It is uncertain to whom Yahweh is speaking these commands.
  * **Strike the tops of the pillars so that the foundations will shake** - It is implied that Yahweh is speaking about the pillars and foundations of a temple. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **so that the foundations will shake** - Here "foundations" represents the whole temple. AT: "so that the whole temple will shake" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Break them in pieces on all of their heads** - Here "heads" represents the whole person. AT: "Break the tops of the pillars so that the temple falls on all of the people and kills them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **I will kill the last of them with the sword** - Here "sword" represents an army attacking with their weapons. AT: "I will send an enemy army to kill the rest of them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Though they dig into Sheol, there my hand will take them. Though they climb up to heaven, there I will bring them down** - Yahweh uses an exaggerated image of people fleeing to Sheol or heaven to try to escape being killed. Here "Sheol" and "heaven" are a merism that represents all places. AT: "Even if they were to flee to Sheol or to heaven, they would not be able to escape me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **there my hand will take them** - Here "hand" represents Yahweh's power. AT: "I will pull them up from there" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
