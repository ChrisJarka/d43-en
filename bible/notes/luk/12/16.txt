\v 16 And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
\v 17 and he reasoned within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have not where to store my fruits?
\v 18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I store all my grain and my goods.
\v 19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry.
