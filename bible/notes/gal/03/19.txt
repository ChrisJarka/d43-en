\v 20 Now, when a mediator functions, one person is not speaking with another directly; but God himself made his promises directly to Abraham.

\v 19 Why then was there the law? It was added because of transgressions, untill the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made, and it was commanded through angels by the hand of a mediator.
\v 20 Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.
