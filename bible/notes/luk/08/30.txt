===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **What is your name?****
 - **  It is unclear if Jesus was addressing the man or the demon, but the demon answered.
    * **Army  **  - This could also be translated as "Battalion" or "Brigade" in languages that have words for large groups of soldiers in an army.
    * **they kept imploring him**  - That is, "the demons continued to beg him."
    * **the abyss**  - Or, "bottomless pit." The Jews recognized this as a place of the dead and demons. "Bottomless" may convey the idea of continually falling away from the love or presence of God.
