I received this message about Israel in a vision two years before the \add big\add* earthquake. It was when Uzziah was the king of Judah and Jeroboam, the son of \add King\add* Jehoash, was the king of Israel.

\v 2 This is what Yahweh said:
\q1 "I will roar \add like a lion\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 when I speak from Zion \add Hill in\add* Jerusalem \f + \ft doublet \f*, my voice will \add resemble the sound of\add* thunder.
\q1 \add When that happens\add*, the pastures where you shepherds \add take care of\add* your sheep will dry up
\q2 and \add the grass\add* on top of Carmel \add Mountain\add* will wither\f + \ft Or: become brown \f*
\q2 \add because I will cause that no rain will fall\add*."

\v 1 This is the message that Yahweh gave to Amos, a shepherd near the town of Tekoa south of Jerusalem. He received this message about Israel in a vision two years before the big earthquake. It was when Uzziah was the king of Judah and Jeroboam son of King Jehoash, was the king of Israel.
\p
\v 2 This is what Amos said:
\q1 "Yahweh will shout very loudly;
\q2 when he speaks from Mount Zion in Jerusalem, his voice will sound like thunder.
\q1 When that happens, the pastures where you shepherds take care of your sheep will dry up,
\q2 and the grass on top of Mount Carmel will wither
\q2 because Yahweh will order the rain not to fall."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **These are the things concerning Israel that Amos, one of the shepherds in Tekoa, received in revelation** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "These are the things concerning Israel that God revealed to Amos, one of the shepherds in Tekoa" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **These are the things** - "This is the message"
  * **in Tekoa** - "Tekoa" is the name of a town or village. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **He received these things** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "God gave him these things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and also in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash king of Israel** - This is an idiom and refers to the time when each king reigned. AT: "when Uzziah was king of Judah, and also when Jeroboam son of Joash was king of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **two years before the earthquake** - The assumed knowledge is that the original hearers would be aware of when a large earthquake had affected the area. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

  * **Yahweh will roar** - The author speaks of the voice of Yahweh as if it were the roar of a lion or the roar of thunder. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh** - This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the translationWord page about Yahweh concerning how to translate this.
