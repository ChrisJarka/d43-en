\v 9 The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesusâ€™ sake only, but that they
might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 10 But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;
\v 11 because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
