  * bullet

There are different ways to translate Biblical units for measuring weights:

  - Spell the word in a way that is similar to the way the Bible term is spelled, or the way it sounds. Then give the equivalent value using a unit of measure that is known to the receptor culture. This explanation could be put in the text or in a note.
  - Directly use the equivalent amount in terms of the unit of measure that is known to the receptor culture, without using the Bible name.
