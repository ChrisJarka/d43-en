\v 1 And working together with him we entreat also that you receive not the grace of God in vain
\v 2 (for he saith,
\q At an acceptable time I listened to thee,
\q And in a day of salvation did I succor thee:
\m behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation):
\v 3 giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed;
\v 4 but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in
distresses,
\v 5 in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
\v 6 in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
\v 7 in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
\v 8 by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and
yet true;
\v 9 as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
\v 10 as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and
yet possessing all things.
\p
\v 11 Our mouth is open to you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.
\v 12 You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own affections.
\v 13 Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as to my children), be you also enlarged.
\v 14 Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion has
light with darkness?
\v 15 And what concord has Christ with Belial? or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?
\v 16 And what agreement has a temple of God with idols? for we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell
in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\v 17 Wherefore
\q Come you out from among them, and be you separate,
\m says the Lord,
\q And touch no unclean thing;
\q And I will receive you,
\q
\v 18 And will be to you a Father,
\q And you shall be to me sons and daughters,
\m says the Lord Almighty.
