<usfm>
\q
\v 13 So also are the paths of all who forget God,
\q the hope of the godless will perish.
\q
\v 14 His confidence will break apart,
\q and his trust is as weak as a spider's web.
\q
\v 15 he leans on his house, but it will not support him;
\q he takes hold of it, but it does not stand.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - It is unclear if verses 11-14 are the teaching of Bildad, or if Bildad is quoting the sayings of the ancestors of [[:en:bible:notes:job:08:08|8:8-10]].

  * **So also are the paths of all who forget God** - Here "the paths" leads to a person's future and the events that will happen to them. AT: "The same thing will happen to everyone who forgets God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **the hope of the godless will perish** - "the things the godless desire will not happen"
  * **His confidence will break apart ... his trust is as weak as a spider's web** - These two phrases mean the same things and emphasize that the godless person is trusting in something that cannot save him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **his trust is as weak as a spider's web** - Here Bildad compares the trust of the godless person to a spider's web; the slightest force will break both. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **it will not support him** - This negative statement emphasizes the opposite. AT: "he will fall down" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **it does not stand** - This negative statement emphasizes the opposite. AT: "it will fall down" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
