\p
\v 14 Christ himself \add has caused us Jewish and non-Jewish believers\add* to have peace \add with each other\add*. He has made both \add of our groups\add* to become one \add group\add*. \add Just like people\add* tear down\f + \ft Or: demolish \f* a wall that separates \add groups of people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, he has destroyed the hatred \add between Jews and non-Jews\add*.
\v 15 By dying \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add for us on the cross\add* he made it no longer \add necessary for us to obey\add* all the \add Jewish\add* laws and rituals \add in order to be saved\add*. He did that in order to enable the two \add groups\add* to become one new group because of our relationship with him. The result was that he has caused us to have peace \add with each other\add*.
\v 16 By \add dying on\add* the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f* he caused both Jews and non-Jews to have a peaceful relationship with God. That is how he caused us to no longer be \f + \ft metaphor \f* enemies \add with God\add* \f + \ft Or: \add with each other\add* \f*.

\v 13 But now because of what Christ Jesus has done, you have been able to trust in him because Christ agreed to die on the cross.

\p
\v 14 Christ has brought peace and unity between Jews and non-Jews by destroying the barrier between us, as if he had destroyed a wall of hate that separated our peoples from one another.
\v 15 He made it no longer necessary for us to obey all the Jewish laws and commandments. He made Jews and non-Jews into one people instead of two because he made peace between us.
\v 16 Jesus caused Jews and non-Jews together to both become friends with God in one new group of believers. By dying on the cross, Jesus made it possible for them to stop hating each other.

\v 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away from God have been brought near to God by the blood of Christ.
\v 14 For he is our peace because he made both Jews and Gentiles one people. By his body He destroyed the wall of hostility that divided us from each other.
\v 15 That is, he abolished the the law of commandments and regulations so that he might create one new people out of two peoples, thus making peace.
\v 16 He did this to reconcile both peoples into one body to God through the cross, putting to death the hostility between them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But now in Christ Jesus** - "But now because of what Christ Jesus has done" (See: UDB)
  * **you who were once far away from God have been brought near to God** - A person being moved from a distant location to one close to home is compared to unbelievers being brought close to God when they become believers. (See: [[;en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **he is our peace** - This might be translated as "Jesus gives us his peace"; however the original text would be better translated as "he himself is our peace" rather than just Jesus gives us peace.
  * **By his body** - "By his death on the cross"
  * **He destroyed the wall of hostility that divided us from each other** - The word "hostility" could be translated as "hatred" or "ill will" or "enmity".
  * **he abolished the the law of commandments and regulations** - "he made it no longer necessary for us to obey all the Jewish laws and commandments" (See: UDB)
  * **He did this to reconcile both peoples** -  The word "reconcile" could be translated "bring together". The phrase "both peoples" refers to the Jews and Gentiles.
  * **putting to death the hostility between them** - The word "hostility" could be translated as "hatred" or "ill will" or "enmity". This phrase shows how the fighting between Jews and Gentiles was ended in the same way as death brings an end to a living person. (See: [[;en:ta:translate:metaphor|Metaphor]])
