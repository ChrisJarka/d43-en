===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **some of his ways, and we may walk in his paths** - "his will so that we may obey him"
  * **for out of Zion will go the law, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem** - Both of these phrase mean the same thing. Isaiah is emphasizing that all nations will understand that the truth is only found in Jerusalem. It can be translated "for the law of Yahweh will go out from Zion, and the message of Yahweh from Jerusalem." (See:[[:en:ta:translate:doublet|Doublet]])
