====== Text Team Member ======


==== Team Purpose ====

The purpose of the Text team is to create two source texts for Bible translation:

  - **ULB (UnfoldingWord Literal Bible)** - This is an update to the 1901 ASV, removing archaic language and terms, and making it more understandable for people with limited English skills, and yet retaining the accuracy and the symmetry with the original languages.
  - **UDB (UnfoldingWord Dynamic Bible)** - This is an adaptation of TFT (Translation for Translators) to restore many of the idioms and theological terms, and yet keep the easy-reading nature and the shortened sentences as much as possible. 

The team will strive to keep the balance of accuracy and readability of the two versions, so that translators will have both a dynamic and a literal source text. 

The team should also continually remember that the texts are to be used as //intermediate source texts//, and not as //finished English versions//. Both texts will be translated into several dozen "gateway" languages, so they must be very clear and easy to understand.
