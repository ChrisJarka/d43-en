\v 12 They will take away all the people's valuable possessions and steal the things that the merchants sell. They will tear down the walls of the houses and destroy their fine houses. Then they will throw into the sea the stones \add from the walls\add* of those houses and the timber and the rubble.
\v 13 No longer will you sing noisy songs, and people will not play their harps anymore.
\v 14 They will cause the city to become a bare rock and \add only\add* a place where men spread their fishing nets. And the city will never be rebuilt. \add Those things will surely happen\add* because I, Yahweh the Lord, have declared \add that they will happen\add*.

\v 12 And they shall make a spoil of your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise; and they shall break down your walls, and
destroy your pleasant houses; and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the waters.
\v 13 And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound of your harps shall be no more heard.
\v 14 And I will make you a bare rock; you shall be a place for the spreading of nets; you shall be built no more: for I
Jehovah have spoken it, says the Lord Jehovah.
