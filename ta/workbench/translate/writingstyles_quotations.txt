===== Writing Styles - Quotations =====

===== Description =====

When telling what a person has said, what he said is put between inverted commas or quotation marks. ("_") Who said it and to whom was it said along with a verb of saying is called the quote margin and is placed outside of the inverted commas or quotation marks. English allows the quote margin to be before, in the middle or at the end of the quotation. It also allows a large verity of verbs of saying. Most languages allow the quote margin to occur either only before, after or both before the quotation and most languages have fewer "saying" words they use.\\
Examples(s)\\
__the angel said to him,__ "Do not be afraid," (Luke 1:13)\\
"Come over here," __he shouted to them,__ "and I will show you what I mean."\\
Purpose: The purpose of this page is to help you decide where to put your quote margins.\\

=== Reason this could be a translation issue ===
It is important for naturalness and clarity that you follow the system of quote margins that your language uses.


===== Examples from the Bible =====
But his mother answered and said, "No, instead he will be called John." (Luke 1:60)
"For look, days are coming"—this is Yahweh’s declaration—"when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel"  (Jeremiah 30:3)

===== Translation Strategies =====
  - Observe how and where people in your language group place the quote margin and what verbs they use.
  - Make sure you follow that system in your translation.



===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====
1. Observe how and where people in your language group place the quote margin and what verbs they use.
2. Make sure you follow that system in your translation.
  * **But his mother answered and said, "No, instead he will be called John.**:(Luke 1:60)
  * If your language uses a margin both before and after the quotation:
  * saying, "No, instead he will be called John" his mother said.
  * 
  * **“For look, days are coming”—this is Yahweh’s declaration—“when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel”** (Jeremiah 30:3)
  * If your language puts the margin before the quotation:
  * Yahweh declares, “For look, days are coming when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel” (Jeremiah 30:3)
