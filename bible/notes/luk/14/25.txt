\v 25 A large crowd of people was traveling with Jesus. He turned toward the people and said to them,
\v 26 "If anyone comes to me who loves his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters more than he loves me, he cannot be my disciple. He must even love me more than he loves his own life!
\v 27 Whoever does not carry his own cross and whoever does not obey me cannot be my disciple.

\v 25 Now large crowds were going together with him, and he turned and said to them,
\v 26 "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
\v 27 Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father ... he cannot be my disciple.** - This has "not" and "cannot." It can also be expressed positively: "If anyone comes to me, he can be my disciple only if he hates his own father ..."
    * **hate**  - This is an exaggeration to show how important it is that people love Jesus much more than anyone else. (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:hyperbole]]). If the hyperbole would be misunderstood, it can be translated "If anyone comes to me and does not love me more than he loves his father ... He cannot be my disciple." It too, can be expressed positively "If anyone comes to me, he can be my disciple only if he loves me more than he loves his own father ...."
    * **yes, and his own life also**  - "and even his own life"
    * **carry his own cross**  - figurative phrase meaning "willing to die"; a disciple must be willing to die for Christ's treachings if necessary. This could also be translated, "carry the means of his own death or execution."
