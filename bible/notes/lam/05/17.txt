===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For this our heart has become sick** - The "heart" represents a person's emotions. This speaks of a person being discouraged as if their emotions were sick. AT: "Because of this we are discouraged" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **for these things our eyes have grown dim** - This means that they have a hard time seeing because they are crying. AT: "and we can hardly see because our eyes are full of tears" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **jackals** - These are fierce wild dogs. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lam:04:03|4:3]].
  * **for Mount Zion lies desolate** - Here "Mount Zion" refers to Jerusalem. The phrase "lies desolate" means that no one lives there.
