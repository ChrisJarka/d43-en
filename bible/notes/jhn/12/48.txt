====== John 12:48-50 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 48 There is something that will judge those who reject me and do not accept my message. On the judgment day \add God\add* will condemn them\add because they rejected\add* the message that I have told them.
\v 49 I have not said things from my own \add authority\add*. Instead, \add my\add* Father, the one who sent me, instructed me what to say and how I should say it.
\v 50 I know that \add paying attention to\add* what he has instructed us \add leads to\add* eternal life. So whatever I say is exactly \f + \ft Or: only \f* what \add my\add* Father has told me to say."
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 48 The one who rejects me and does not follow my message already has a judge who will condemn what they do, that is: The message I have spoken to them.
\v 49 I have not taught about God and his kingdom by my own authority. The Father who sent me gave me clear instructions on what I should say and how I should say it.
\v 50 I know that his most important instructions are the ones that lead to eternal life. And I have said exactly what my Father has told me to say."
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, has one that judges him: the word that I spake, the same shall
judge him in the last day.
\v 49 For I spoke not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he has given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I
should speak.
\v 50 And I know that his commandment is life eternal; the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to
me, so I speak.
