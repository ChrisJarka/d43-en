\v 12 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about,
even the wheels that they four had.
\v 13 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing the whirling
wheels.
\v 14 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and
the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
