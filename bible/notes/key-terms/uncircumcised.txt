====== uncircumcised, uncircumcision ======

===== Definition: =====


The terms "uncircumcised" and "uncircumcision" refer to the state of a male who has not been physically circumcised.

  * In the Old Testament, circumcision was required as a physical sign of being part of God's people, Israel. It was typically done on male babies eight days after birth. A male who has not had this procedure done is uncircumcised.
  * In the Bible, people who have an "uncircumcised heart" or who are "uncircumcised in heart" are people who are stubbornly disobedient to God and who are not his people.
