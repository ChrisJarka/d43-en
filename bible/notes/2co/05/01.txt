\v 1 We know that these bodies we live in here in this world are like tents. They are like temporary living places. So we should not be concerned about what happens to our bodies. We know that if we are killed, God will give us permanent living places. Those permanent living places will not be houses that people have made. They will be new bodies in which we will live forever in heaven.
\v 2 While we are here on earth, we suffer. We often groan because we desire to go to heaven where God will give us our new bodies .
\v 3 When God gives us our new bodies, our spirits will have bodies to live in that will last forever.

\v 1 We know that if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed, we will have a building from God, a house not made by human hands, but an eternal house, in heaven.
\v 2 For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our heavenly dwelling--
\v 3 if by putting it on, we will not be found naked.
