\v 1 For the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that was a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers
into his vineyard.
\v 2 And when he had agreed with the laborers for a shilling a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
\v 3 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing in the marketplace idle;
\v 4 and to them he said, Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
\v 5 Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.
\v 6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing; and he says to them, Why stand you here
all the day idle?
\v 7 They say to him, Because no man has hired us. He says to them, Go you also into the vineyard.
\v 8 And when even was come, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the laborers, and pay them their hire,
beginning from the last to the first.
\v 9 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a shilling.
\v 10 And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a shilling.
\v 11 And when they received it, they murmured against the householder,
\v 12 saying, These last have spent but one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of
the day and the scorching heat.
\v 13 But he answered and said to one of them, Friend, I do you no wrong: did not you agree with me for a shilling?
\v 14 Take up that which is thine, and go your way; it is my will to give to this last, even as to thee.
\v 15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? or is your eye evil, because I am good?
\v 16 So the last shall be first, and the first last.

\v 17 And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said to them,
\v 18 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes; and they shall
condemn him to death,
\v 19 and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall be raised up.
\p
\v 20 Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping
him, and asking a certain thing of him.
\v 21 And he said to her, What would thou? She says to him, Command that these my two sons may sit, one on your right
hand, and one on your left hand, in your kingdom.
\v 22 But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say
to him, We are able.
\v 23 He says to them, My cup indeed you shall drink: but to sit on my right hand, and on
my left hand, is not mine to give; but it is for them for whom it has been prepared of my Father.
\v 24 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren.
\v 25 But Jesus called them to him, and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones
exercise authority over them.
\v 26 Not so shall it be among you: but whoever would become great among you shall be your minister;
\v 27 and whoever would be first among you shall be your servant:
\v 28 even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

\v 29 And as they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
\v 30 And behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Lord,
have mercy on us, you son of David.
\v 31 And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Lord, have mercy
on us, you son of David.
\v 32 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will you that I should do to you?
\v 33 They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
\v 34 And Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and straightway they received their sight, and followed him.
