<usfm> \p \v 19 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: When I make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I rais up the deep against you and the great waters cover you, \v 20 then I will bring you down as those who went down into the pit, to the people of antiquity; for I will make you dwell in the lowest realms of the earth like ruins of ancient times, going down into the pit. Because of this you will not be inhabited, but I will give splendor in the land of the living! \v 21 I will give you calamity and you will be no more. Then you will be sought but you will never be found for all time.’—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration!” </usfm>
