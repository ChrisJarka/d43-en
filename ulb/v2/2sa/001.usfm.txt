\v 1 And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had
abode two days in Ziklag;
\v 2 it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth
upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
\v 3 And David said to him, From whence come thou? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
\v 4 And David said to him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle,
and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
\v 5 And David said to the young man that told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
\v 6 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear;
and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.
\v 7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here am I.
\v 8 And he said to me, Who are thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
\v 9 And he said to me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet
whole in me.
\v 10 So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the
crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither to my lord.
\p
\v 11 Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
\v 12 and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and
for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
\v 13 And David said to the young man that told him, Whence are thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an
Amalekite.
\v 14 And David said to him, How was you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Jehovah’s anointed?
\v 15 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he struck him, so that he died.
\v 16 And David said to him, Your blood be upon your head; for your mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain
Jehovah’s anointed.
\p
\v 17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son
\v 18 (and he bade them teach the children of Judah the song of
the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
\q
\v 19 Your glory, O Israel, is slain upon your high places!
\q How are the mighty fallen!
\q
\v 20 Tell it not in Gath,
\q Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon;
\q Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
\q Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
\q
\v 21 You mountains of Gilboa,
\q Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings:
\q For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,
\q The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
\q
\v 22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,
\q The bow of Jonathan turned not back,
\q And the sword of Saul returned not empty.
\q
\v 23 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives,
\q And in their death they were not divided:
\q They were swifter than eagles,
\q They were stronger than lions.
\q
\v 24 You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
\q Who clothed you in scarlet delicately,
\q Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
\q
\v 25 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
\q Jonathan is slain upon your high places.
\q
\v 26 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:
\q Very pleasant have you been to me:
\q Your love to me was wonderful,
\q Passing the love of women.
\q
\v 27 How are the mighty fallen,
\q And the weapons of war perished!
