\c 14
\p
\v 1 O Israel, return to Jehovah your God; for you have fallen by your iniquity.
\v 2 Take with you words, and return to Jehovah: say to him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so will
we render as bullocks the offering of our lips.
\v 3 Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands,
You are our gods; for in you the fatherless finds mercy.
\p
\v 4 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him.
\v 5 I will be as the dew to Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
\v 6 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
\v 7 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive
as the grain, and blossom as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
\v 8 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a
green fir-tree; from me is your fruit found.
\v 9 Who is wise, that he may understand these things? prudent, that he may know them? for the ways of Jehovah are right, and
the just shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein.
