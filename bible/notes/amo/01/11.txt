\v 11 Yahweh also said this to me:
\q1 "\add I will punish the people of\add* Edom because of the many sins that \add their people\add* have committed;
\q2 I will not change my mind about punishing them,
\q1 because they pursued the people of Israel, who descended from Esau's \add brother Jacob, and killed them\add* with swords;
\q2 they did not act mercifully toward them at all.
\q1 They were extremely angry \add with the people of Israel\add*,
\q2 and they continued to be angry with them.
\q1
\v 12 I will cause a fire to burn Teman \add district in Edom\add*
\q2 and completely burn the fortresses of Bozrah, \add the biggest city in Edom\add*."

\q
\v 11 This is what Yahweh says,
\q "For three sins of Edom,
\q even for four,
\q I will not turn away punishment,
\q because he pursued his brother with the sword
\q and cast off all pity.
\q His anger raged continually,
\q and his wrath lasted forever.
\q
\v 12 I will send fire on Teman,
\q and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **For three sins of ... even for four** - This poetic device is not meant to imply that a specific number of sins had been committed, but to communicate that an abundance of sins had led to God's judgment. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:01:03|1:3]].
  * **Edom** - Here "Edom" represents the people of the country of Edom. AT: "the people of Edom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I will not turn away punishment** - Yahweh uses two negatives here for emphasis. See how you translated these words in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:01:03|1:3]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **he pursued his brother** - The assumed knowledge is that Esau, from whom the people of Edom were descended, was the brother of Jacob, from whom the people of Israel were descended. Here "his brother" represents the people of Israel. AT: "he pursued the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **cast off all pity** - "showed them no mercy"
  * **His anger raged continually, and his wrath lasted forever** - These two phrases mean the same thing and are repeated for emphasis. The abstract nouns "anger" and "wrath" can be translated using the adjectives "angry" and "furious." AT: "He was continually angry and always furious" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **his wrath lasted forever** - This is an exaggeration that is meant to express the ongoing nature of his wrath. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Teman ... Bozrah** - These are names of places. See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]
  * **it will devour the palaces of Bozrah** - Here Yahweh's judgment is spoken of as if it were a fire that was consuming the palaces. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
