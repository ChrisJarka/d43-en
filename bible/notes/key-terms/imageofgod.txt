====== image of God ======

===== Definition: =====

People were created in the "image of God," which means that man is created in the likeness of God himself. When this phrase is applied to Jesus, it means that he is God himself.

  * The term "image of God" may refer to man's physical image, but also may refer to emotions, spirituality, thought, reasoning ability, and ability to communicate.
  * In the New Testament, it says that Jesus is the "image of the invisible God" and that he is the "exact representation of his being."
  * Jesus was not created in the image of God, he has always been the image of God, which means he is the same essence and being as God.
