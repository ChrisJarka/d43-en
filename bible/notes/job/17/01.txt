===== Translation Notes: =====

Job continues to speak.

  * **My spirit is consumed** - AT: "I am consumed" or "I have lost all of my strength" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) 
  * **my days are over** - AT: "I am going to die soon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **my eye must always see** - AT: "I always have to see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **provocation** - the offensive, unpleasant, and irritating remarks of other people
  * **Give now a pledge** - Job is speaking to Yahweh.
  * **a pledge** - When people accused a person of a crime, a guarantor could give a pledge for that person until a trial could be held. This pledge allowed the person to go free until the trial and was the guarantors way of affirming the innocence of that person. 
  * **be a guarantee for me with yourself** - Job is asking God to give a pledge confirming Job's innocence, but God is also his judge. So God has to give the pledge to himself.
  * **who else is there who will help me** - "there is no one else who can help me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
