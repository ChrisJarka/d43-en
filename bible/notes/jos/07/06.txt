\v 6 And Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the
elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.
\v 7 And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, wherefore have you at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into
the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan!
