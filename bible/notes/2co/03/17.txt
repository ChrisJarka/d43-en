<usfm>
\v 17 Now the world "Lord" here means "the Spirit." Where the Spirit of the Lord is, people become free.
\v 18 But as for all of us who believe, we see the Lord who shines with the light from God, and we look at him with no veil over his face.  God is changing us to be more and more wonderful like him. This is what the Lord does, he who is the Spirit.

<usfm>
\v 17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
\v 18 Now all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same glorious likeness from one degree of glory into another, just as this is from the Lord, who is the Spirit.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord**  - Both of these phrases refer to the ability to understand God's message. The word "seeing" is used to refer to the ability to understand something.  Unveiling a person's face allows them to see clearly and is also used to refer to being able to understand.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **the same glorious likeness** - something that is like the Lord, or something that shows God's glory.
