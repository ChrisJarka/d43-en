===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 This is what you should ask each prophet: 'What did Yahweh reply \add when you talked to him\add*? What is he saying to us?'
\v 38 If he replies, '\add What I told you\add* is a prophecy\f + \ft Or: message \f* from Yahweh,' you should say to him, 'You have continued to say, "I received a prophecy\f + \ft Or: message \f* from Yahweh" even though I told you to not claim that you have received prophecies\f + \ft Or: messages \f* from Yahweh.'
\v 39 So I, Yahweh, will get rid of you \add false prophets\add*. I will expel you from my presence. And I will get rid of this city that I gave to you and to your ancestors.
\v 40 I will cause people to make fun of you forever. People will never forget that you were disgraced."

\v 37 Thus shall you say to the prophet, What has Jehovah answered thee? and, What has Jehovah spoken?
\v 38 But if you say, The burden of Jehovah; therefore thus says Jehovah: Because you say this word, The burden of Jehovah, and
I have sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The burden of Jehovah;
\v 39 therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave to you and to your
fathers, away from my presence:
\v 40 and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
