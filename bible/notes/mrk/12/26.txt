\v 26 But as to people becoming alive again after they die, in the book that Moses \add wrote, he said something about people who have died\add* that I am sure that you have read \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. When Moses \add was looking at\add* the bush \add that was burning\add*, God said to him, 'I am the God whom Abraham \add worships\add* and the God whom Isaac \add worships\add* and the God whom Jacob \add worships\add*.'
\v 27 It is not dead people who worship God. It is living people who worship him. \add Abraham, Isaac and Jacob died long before Moses lived, but God said that they were still worshipping him, so we know their spirits were still alive!\add* So your \add claim that dead people do not become alive again\add* is very wrong."

\v 26 But as touching the dead, that they are raised; have you not read in the book of Moses, in
the place concerning the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I
am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
\v 27 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: you do greatly err.
