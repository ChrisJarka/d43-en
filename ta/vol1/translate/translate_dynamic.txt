===== Meaning-Based Translations =====

This module answers the question: What are Meaning Based Translations?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: ['translate_whatis', 'translate_process', 'translate_literal', 'translate_fandm']

We have looked closely at literal translations. Now, we will look at meaning-based translations.
Other Names Meaning-based translations are also called: 
  * meaning-equivalent
  * idiomatic
  * dynamic
==== Key Characteristic ====
The key characteristic of meaning-based translations is that they give priority to the meaning over the form of the text. That is, they **change the form of the text as needed in order to make the meaning clear.**  The most common types of changes that are made are: 
  * change word order to match grammar of receptor language
  * substitute or explain idioms
  * explain or translate words or terms with deeper meaning (ex: "Golgotha" = "place of the skull")
  * replace objects or terms that are unknown in the receptor culture with equivalent terms
=== Paraphrases ===
The most extreme form of meaning-based translation is the "paraphrase." Many people would debate whether a paraphrase is actually a translation of the Bible, or whether it is really another kind of Scripture product. However, most meaning-based translations are more moderate.
==== Examples of Meaning-Based Translations ====
What does a meaning-based translation look like? We will look at how different versions translate the same verse.
In Luke 3:8, //John the Baptist rebukes the self-righteous people who came to be baptized.//\\
The **Greek **  text of the first half of the verse is shown below.
Ποιήσατε οὖν καρποὺς ἀξίους τῆς μετανοίας
The **English **  translation in the same order as each Greek word.
Do/make/produce therefore fruits fit/appropriate of the repentance
=== Literal ===
A literal translate would usually follow the words and order of the Greek text as closely as possible.
Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, … [NASB]
Note that this fairly-literal translation retains the words "fruit" and "repentance. The word order is also very similar to the Greek text.
=== Meaning-Based ===
Meaning-based translations, on the other hand, are more likely to change the words and order if the translators think it will help to clarify the meaning. Consider these two meaning-based translations:
//…prove that you have turned from sin by doing worthy deeds.//  [Living Bible (LB)]
//Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. //  [New Living Translation (NLT)]
Notice that both of these translations have changed the word order. Also, the word "fruit" no longer appears. Instead, they refer to "deeds" or to "the way you live." The meaning is the same, but the form is very different.
