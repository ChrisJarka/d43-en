===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **keep fast**  - explanation
    * **come to harm**  - this has more to do with the fact that she's “gleaning” in the field at the beginning of the barley harvest rather than gleaning at the proper time, which is the end of the harvest. Naomi knows that in another field, the owner would interfere or stop her from picking grain until the appropriate time. Naomi isn't necessarily speaking about someone physically harming Ruth but about them interfering with her “gleaning.”
