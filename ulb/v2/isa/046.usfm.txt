\c 46
\p
\v 1 Bel bows down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: the things that you carried about are
made a load, a burden to the weary beast.
\v 2 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
\p
\v 3 Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne
by me from their birth, that have been carried from the womb;
\v 4 and even to old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry
you; I have made, and I will bear; yea, I will carry, and will deliver.
\v 5 To whom will you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?
\v 6 Such as lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, they hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god; they
fall down, yea, they worship.
\v 7 They bear it upon the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it standeth, from its place shall it not
remove: yea, one may cry to it, yet can it not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.
\p
\v 8 Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to mind, O you transgressors.
\v 9 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else;
I am God, and there is none like me;
\v 10 declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not
yet done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure;
\v 11 calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it
to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.
\p
\v 12 Listen to me, you stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness:
\v 13 I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry; and I will place salvation in
Zion for Israel my glory.
