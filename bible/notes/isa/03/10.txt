===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh continues speaking.
  * **Tell the righteous that it will be well with him** - "Tell those who are doing what is right that I will make things good for them"
  * **for they will eat the fruit of their deeds** - "for they will receive their reward for their good deeds."
  * **O my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them** - The Lord is comparing the leaders of Judah to children and women. He is emphasizing that Judah's leaders are immature and weak. Alternate translation: "Those who act like children harm them, and those who should not be leaders are ruling over them." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]]) 
  * **your leaders lead you astray and confuse the direction of your path** - This compares Judah's leaders who rule over the people to shepherds who lead their sheep. Like a shepherd leads the sheep down good paths to safety, leaders are supposed to teach the people the truth and help them do what is right. The Lord is emphasizing that Judah's leaders are not doing this. Alternate translation: "your leaders are like bad shepherds who lead you away from good paths and do not show you where to go."
