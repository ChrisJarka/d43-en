\v 17 When the king \add of Egypt\add* let the \add Israelite\add* people go, God did not lead them to go through the land of the Philistines. That was a shorter road, but God said, "It would be bad if my people change their minds when they realize that they will have to fight \add the Philistines\add* \add to take their land\add*, and then \add decide to\add* return to Egypt."
\v 18 Instead, God led them to go around through the desert toward the Red Sea \f + \ft Or: the Gulf of Suez \f*. When the Israelite people left Egypt, they were carrying weapons to fight \add their enemies\add*.

\v 17 When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was nearby. For God said, "Perhaps the people will change their minds when they experience war and will return to Egypt."
\v 18 So God led the people around through the desert to the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of the land of Egypt armed for battle.
