===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the commanders of hundreds** - The phrase "commander of hundreds" is probably an official title for a military officer. Possible meanings are 1) the word "hundreds" represents the exact amount of soldiers that these commanders led. AT: "the commanders of 100 soldiers" or 2) the word translated as "hundreds" does not represent an exact number, but is the name of a military division. AT: "the commanders of military divisions" See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:23:01|23:1]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **all the people of the land** - This is a generalization that means he took very many people with him. AT: "a very large group of the people of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **He brought down the king from the house of Yahweh** - The temple was built on the highest hill in Jerusalem. AT: "He brought the king down from the temple to the palace" 
  * **the throne of the kingdom** - "the royal throne"
  * **So all the people of the land** - This is generalization to say that most of the people rejoiced. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **the city was quiet** - Here "the city" represents the people of the city, and "quiet" represents peace, since no one opposed Joash after Athaliah died. AT: "the people of the city were at peace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
