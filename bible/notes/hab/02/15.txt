===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **the one**  - The phrase "the one" refers to the Chaldeans.
    * **add your poison** - "add your poison to their drink" (See:[[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
    * **gorged with shame rather than glory** - The word "gorged" refers to someone who has eaten a lot.  Here it is used to show the Chaldeans will have a lot of shame instead of glory. (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])
    * **The cup of Yahweh's right hand**  - This phrase means Yahweh's judgement is represented as a cup. It is held in the hand of power which is the right hand. This continues the image of a cup being forced upon another that has been previously developed earlier in the book. (See: [[en:ta:translate:personification]])
    * ** will come in its turn to you**  - This means "will happen to you."
