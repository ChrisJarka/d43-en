\c 7
\p
\v 1 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings
and blessed him,
\v 2 to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also
King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
\v 3 without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like to
the Son of God), remains a priest continually.
\p
\v 4 Now consider how great this man was, to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.
\v 5 And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priestâ€™s office have commandment to take tithes of the people
according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham:
\v 6 but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes of Abraham, and has blessed him that has the promises.
\v 7 But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.
\v 8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
\v 9 And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, has paid tithes;
\v 10 for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.
\p
\v 11 Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it has the people received the law), what
further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after
the order of Aaron?
\v 12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
\v 13 For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no man has given attendance at the altar.
\v 14 For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
\v 15 And what we say is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another
priest,
\v 16 who has been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:
\v 17 for it is witnessed of him,
\q You are a priest for ever
\q After the order of Melchizedek.
\p
\v 18 For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness
\v 19 (for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
\v 20 And inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath
\v 21 (for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that says of him,
\q The Lord sware and will not repent himself,
\q You are a priest for ever);
\p
\v 22 by so much also has Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.
\v 23 And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:
\v 24 but he, because he remains for ever, has his priesthood unchangeable.
\v 25 Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near to God through him, seeing he ever lives to
make intercession for them.
\v 26 For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
\v 27 who needs not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the
sins of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.
\v 28 For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law,
appointeth a Son, perfected for evermore.
