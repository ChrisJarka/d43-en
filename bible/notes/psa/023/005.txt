David, the Psalm writer, continues the picture of Yahweh as his shepherd.

  * **prepare a table** - David pictures the shepherd taking the sheep to grass for their meal.
  * **anointed my head with oil** - The shepherd would put oil on their cuts for soothing and healing.
  * **my cups runs over** - These words are used to indicate the joy of the author. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
