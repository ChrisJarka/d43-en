\v 1 About that time we disciples approached Jesus and said, "Who \add among us will be\add* the most important when God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] \add makes you\add* king?"
\v 2 Jesus called a child to come, and he placed that child in our midst.
\v 3 He said, "Think about this: If you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* do not change \add the way you\f + \ft plural \f* think\add* and become \add as humble\add* as little children, you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* will surely not go to the place where God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] rules.
