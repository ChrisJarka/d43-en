<usfm>
\v 5 Instead, the goal of what we command you to teach is to love God from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from faith that is sincere.
\v 6 Some men have stopped trying to do these good things; instead, they are now saying useless things.
\v 7 They want to teach about the law, but they do not understand it. Yet they insist that what they teach is true.
\p
\v 8 But we know that law is good if we know how to use it according to what the law says.
