\v 17 You who are called Jew by name, rest upon the law, rejoice proudly in God,
\v 18 know his will, test the things that differ--being instructed out of the Law--
\v 19 are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
\v 20 a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, and have in the Law the form of knowledge and of the truth.
