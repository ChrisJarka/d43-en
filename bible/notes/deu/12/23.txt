===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **do not consume the blood, for the blood is the life - **  Translators may add a footnote such as this: “The blood is a symbol for life.” They may also add a foot note saying something like this: “God commanded people not to eat meat while the blood was still in it. They had to drain out the blood first.” See how you translated in Gen 9:3,4.
  * **you will pour it out on the earth like water**  - Here the blood is compared to water to show that it should be shed without ceremony (or idolatry) and poured on the earth as a common thing like water. In Lev 17:13 Yahweh ordains to cover the blood with earth.
  * **right in the eyes of Yahweh**  - “right according to Yahweh” or “right before Yahweh” (See: Synecdoche)
