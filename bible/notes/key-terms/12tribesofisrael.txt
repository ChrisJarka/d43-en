====== twelve tribes of Israel ======

===== Definition: =====

The twelve tribes of Israel refer to the descendants of Jacob, who was also known as "Israel".

  * Jacob was the grandson of Abraham, and God changed Jacob's name to Israel. Both the name "Jacob" and the name "Israel" refer to the same person.
  * The Tribes are as follows: Levi (The Levis were a tribe of priests. The Levis inherited no land in Canaan.), Reuben, Simeon, Judah, Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Benjamin, and Joseph. Joseph inherited no land, but the inheritance of land went to Joseph's two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh.
