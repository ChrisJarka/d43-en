\v 8 This is also what Yahweh the Lord says: "The people of Moab \add south of Ammon\add* and the people of Seir \add south of Moab despised Israel and\add* said, 'The people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Israel have become \add as unimportant\add* as all the other nations!'
\v 9 Therefore, I will destroy the cities that protect the borders of Moab, starting at Beth-Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiriathaim, the finest cities in Moab.
\v 10 I will enable people from the east to conquer Moab and also to conquer Ammon. As the result, just like \add I will cause that\add* Ammon will no longer be remembered by other nations,
\v 11 I will also punish the people of Moab. When that happens, people will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*."

\v 8 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because Moab and Seir say, “Behold! The house of Judah is like every nation!”
\v 9 Therefore behold! I will open the slopes of Moab from his cities on the borders—the splendor of Beth Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiraiathaim—
\v 10 to the children of the east who were against the sons of Ammon. And I will give them up like a property like the sons of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations.
\v 11 So I will perform judgments against Moab and they will know that I am Yahweh!
