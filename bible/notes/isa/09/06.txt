===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given** - Notice that the ULB uses the past tense, but the UDB uses the future tense. Often in prophecy events that will happen in the future are described as happening in the past.  This emphasizes that the events will certainly happen.  Notice that the ULB now uses "us" referring to Israel instead of "them," suggesting Isaiah's view that he belongs to the people of Israel. Alternate translation: "For to us a child has been born; to us the Lord has given a son."  (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:doublet]] and [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:active]] and [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:inclusive]).
  * **the rule will be on his shoulder** - The word "his" refers to the son. Alternate translation: "The son will rule the people." 
  * **his name will be called** - "his name will be" (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:grammar:active]])
  * **Mighty God, Everlasting Father** - These phrases suggest the divine nature of the child who was born to rule.
  * **to establish it and sustain it with justice and with righteousness** - "He will establish and protect his kingdom and rule fairly and justly."
  * **from this time onward and for evermore** - "now and forever" (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:topics:figures:doublet]])
  * **The Zeal of Yahweh of Hosts will do this** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:01:09|1:9]].  Alternate translation: "With great passion and might, the Lord will cause all this to happen."
