====== Joel 02 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

This chapter continues in the poetic form with striking imagery of armies and soldiers. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

It was common for farmers in the Ancient Near East to experience massive locust attacks, in millions of these insects would come and eat all crops in their fields. Joel might be describing such attacks in the second chapter. But because Joel uses military terms and images to describe these locust attacks in this chapter, it is easy to think that his descriptions might instead be a picture of the enemy invaders who would come and destroy the land and its people.

In the same manner, the drought (severe lack of rain) that Joel describes might be a real drought, or it might be a picture of either enemy invaders or of Yahweh himself coming to punish his people and the other nations.

Translators should translate simply, presenting the scenes of locusts and drought as Joel describes them, and not worry about the various possible meanings.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

This chapter uses simile to a great extent as Joel tries to describe this army. Please review [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]].

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

All of the text in the Book of Joel is poetry, as is represented in the ULB. The UDB, however, presents the text as prose, because many translators will choose to use prose in their versions. Translators who wish to translate the book as poetry should read [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_poetry]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]].
