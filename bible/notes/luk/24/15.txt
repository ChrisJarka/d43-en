===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It happened that**  - This phrase is used here to mark where the action starts. It starts with Jesus approaching them. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **Jesus himself**  - The word "himself" focuses on Jesus and the surprise of Jesus actually appearing to them. So far the women had seen the angels, but no one had seen Jesus.
  * **Their eyes were restrained so that they should not recognize him**  - This can be translated with figures of speech as "Their eyes were kept from recognizing Jesus." The men's ability to recognize Jesus is spoken of as their eyes' ability to recognize him. It can be translated without the synecdoche: "They were kept from recognizing him" or "Something prevented them so they did not recognize him."
