\q
\v 23 They will pick up bows and spears. They are cruel and have no compassion. 
\q Their sound is like the sea roar,
\q and they are riding on horses, 
\q set out in order as men for battle, against you,
\q daughter of Zion.'"
\q
\v 24 We have heard the reports about them and our hands fall limp in distress. 
\q Anguish seizes us as a woman giving birth.

  * **They will pick up bows and spears** - "The soldiers will carry bows and spears"
  * **Their sound is like the sea roar** - The loud noise that the soldiers make is compared to the loud noise of the ocean. AT: "The sound that they make is very loud, like the sound of the ocean" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **they are riding on horses, set out in order as men for battle** - The phrase "set out in order" means that they have organized themselves and are riding in rows.

AT: "they are riding on horses in their assigned rows, and they are ready to fight against you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **We have heard** - The word "We" probably refers to Jeremiah and the people of Judah.
  * **our hands fall limp in distress** - "our hands are weak because we are anxious"
