\c 82
\d A Psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 God stands in the congregation of God;
\q He judges among the gods.
\q
\v 2 How long will you judge unjustly,
\q And respect the persons of the wicked? \qs [Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 3 Judge the poor and fatherless:
\q Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.
\q
\v 4 Rescue the poor and needy:
\q Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.
\q
\v 5 They know not, neither do they understand;
\q They walk to and fro in darkness:
\q All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
\q
\v 6 I said, You are gods,
\q And all of you sons of the Most High.
\q
\v 7 Nevertheless you shall die like men,
\q And fall like one of the princes.
\q
\v 8 Arise, O God, judge the earth;
\q For you shall inherit all the nations.
