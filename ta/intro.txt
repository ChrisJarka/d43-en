This section will explain:

  * [[#Why]] the unfoldingWord project exists and why we do what we do
  * [[#How]] we go about trying to accomplish that goal
  * [[#What]] we do to meet that goal

There is also a [[en:ta:intro:map|translation roadmap]] that will help you navigate through the translation and checking process. 

==== Why ====

Jesus commanded his disciples to make disciples of EVERY people group:

<blockquote>"Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.'” -Matthew 28:18-20 (NIV)</blockquote>

We have the promise that one day representatives from EVERY language will be in heaven:

<blockquote>“After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb.” -Revelation 7:9 (NIV)</blockquote>

Having the WORD OF GOD in one's heart language is so important:

<blockquote>"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ." -Romans 10:17 (ESV)</blockquote>

Why do we do what we do? 

The unfoldingWord project exists because every people group deserves to have the Word of God in their language. To this end we seek to make disciples of all nations by helping to provide **unrestricted biblical content in every language of the world**. 

==== How ====

How do we accomplish our goal of **unrestricted biblical content in every language**?

  * [[en:ta:intro:translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines]] - By using a common translation theory and practice
  * [[en:ta:intro:license|Open License]] - By releasing everything we create under an open license
  * [[en:ta:intro:glstrategy|Gateway Languages Strategy]] - By empowering local believers to translate from a language they know
  * [[en:ta:intro:content|What Needs To Be Translated]] - So only what is needed is translated

==== What ====

What do we do? 
  * [[en:ta:intro:projects|Open-licensed content]] - We create free and open biblical content
