===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 13 Those who do not pay attention to what God says are like those reeds; \q2 godless people stop confidently expecting that good things will happen to them. \q1 \v 14 The things they confidently expect to happen do not happen; \q2 things they trust will help them are as weak as a spider's web. \q1 \v 15 If they lean against a house, it falls on them; \q2 if they cling to things for safety, those things will not remain firm.

\q1 </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \q \v 13 So also are the paths of all who forget God, \q the hope of the godless men will perish— \q \v 14 those whose confidence will break apart, \q and those whose trust is as fragile as a spider’s web. \q \v 15 Such a person will lean on his house, but it will not stand; \q he will hold onto it, but it will not last. </usfm>
