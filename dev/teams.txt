====== Overview ======

The unfoldingWord technical initiatives are broken down into various projects.  Each of these projects is run by a Core Team of people who each have specific roles within that project.  Each Core Team is also a part of an Extended Team that primarily provides feedback to the Core Team.

Graphically, the teams look like this:

===== Core Team =====

The roles defined below are the categories that everyone on the Core Team falls into.

^  Accountability  ^  Responsibility  ^  Authority  ^
| Tracker: single person who ensures communication and progress occur | Implementer: group that does the majority of the work to make it happen | Decision Maker: group that makes the high level decisions |

Each of these people or teams must work together to make the project move forward.  Though each has a unique role, the relationship between the three is reciprocal.

^  Core Team  ^  Consultants  ^  Users  ^
