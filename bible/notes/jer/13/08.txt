====== Jeremiah 13:8-11 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Then Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 9 "\add What happened to your waistcloth\add* shows that I will destroy the things that the people of Jerusalem and \add other places in\add* Judah are very proud of.
\v 10 Those wicked people refuse to pay attention to what I say. They stubbornly do just what they desire to do; they worship other gods. Therefore, they will become completely useless, like your waistcloth.
\v 11 Just like a waistcloth clings closely\f + \ft Or: tightly \f* to a man's waist, I wanted the people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Israel and Judah to cling closely to me. I wanted them to be my people, people who would praise me and honor me. But they would not pay attention to me.

\v 8 So the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 9 ‘Thus says Yahweh: I will destroy the presumption of Judah and the presumption of Jerusalem thusly.
\v 10 This wicked people who refuse to listen to my word, who walk in the hardness of their heart, go after other gods to serve them and to worship them: they will be as this undergarment that is profitable for nothing.
\v 11 For just as the undergarment clings to the hips of man, thus I have made all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah cling to me—this is Yahweh’s declaration—to be my people, and a name, a praise, and an honor; yet they would not listen!
