\v 16 And the children of Joseph said, The hill-country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of
the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.
\v 17 And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have
great power; you shall not have one lot only:
\v 18 but the hill-country shall be thine; for yough it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and the goings out thereof shall
be thine; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, yough they have chariots of iron, and yough they are strong.
