\v 7 When he noticed how those that were invited chose the seats of honor, he spoke a parable, saying to them,
\v 8 "When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the place of honor, because a more honorable man than you may have been invited.
\v 9 And when the man that invited you arrives, he will say to you, 'Give this man your place,' and then in shame you will proceed to take the lowest place.
