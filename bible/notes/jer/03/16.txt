===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 Then it will happen that you will increase and bear fruit in the land in those daysâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration. They will no longer say, "The ark of the covenant of Yahweh!" This matter will no longer come up in their hearts, for they will no longer think about it or pay attention to it. This statement will no longer be made.'

===== translationNotes: =====


  * **will increase and bear fruit** - The phrase "bear fruit" is an idiomatic way of saying that they will "increase" in number. AT: "will increase greatly in number." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself as if he were another person so that Jeremiah and the people of Judah will listen carefully to what he says. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07|01:8]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what Yahweh has said" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
