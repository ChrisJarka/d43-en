\v 8 The goat became very powerful. But when its power was very great, its great horn was broken off. But four other distinctive horns grew up in its place. They each pointed to one of the four winds of heaven: north, south, east, and west.

\v 7 I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him, and he struck the ram, and broke off his two horns. The ram was powerless to stand before him, but the goat knocked him down to the ground, and trampled upon him. There was no one who could deliver the ram from his power.
\v 8 Then goat became exceedingly great. But when he became strong, the great horn was broken, and in the place of it there grew up four conspicuous horns that pointed toward the four winds of heaven.
