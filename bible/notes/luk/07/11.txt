\v 11 And it came to be the next day, that He, His disciples and a large crowd journeying together with Him, went to a city called Nain. 
\v 12 And as He came near to the city gate, behold, a man in the state of death was being carried out, an only son to his mother, and she being a widow; but, a sizeable crowd from the city was with her.
\v 13 And beholding her, the Lord was deeply moved with compassion upon her and said to her, "Do not cry;"
\v 14 And coming forward, He touched the coffin and those bearing it stood still. And He said, "Young man, I say to you , arise."
\v 15 And the dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
