===== Wisdom About Best Solutions =====

This module answers the question: //How can best solutions for distribution be identified?//

The best distribution and listening solutions are those which most fully meet the needs of the end-user in their local context. It requires wisdom and discernment to avoid assumptions that one particular method or listening device will work for everyone. Take time to understand the dynamics of a community and identify the best solutions. With a diversity of needs, a combination of options may be the right solution. Thankfully, working with open-licensed content allows us to finally have the freedom to make the best decisions for distribution!
