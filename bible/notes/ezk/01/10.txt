===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 10 The likeness of their faces were like the face of a man, then face of a lion on the right side of the four, and the face of an ox on the left side of the four faces, then the fourth face was the face of an eagle. \v 11 And their faces and their wings were separate above, so each had a pair that joined one another and a pair that covered their bodies. \v 12 So each went straight forward, so wherever the Spirit directed them to go, they went without turning as they went. </usfm>
