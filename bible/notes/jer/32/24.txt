\v 24 And now, \add the army\add* of Babylonia has built ramps up against our city walls \add in order to attack our city\add*. Because of our enemies' swords and because of famines and diseases, they will be able to conquer it easily. The things that you said would happen have now happened.
\v 25 And it is evident that the Babylonian army will soon conquer this city. So now, Yahweh my Lord, \add I do not understand\add* why you told me to buy this field with my silver, while others were watching. \add It seems that I have just been wasting my money by doing that\add*!"

\v 24 Look! The siege mounds have come to the city to take it, for the city has been given to the hand of the Chaldeans who wage war against it because of 
the sword, the famine, and the plague; for what you have declared will be, and look! You are watching.
\v 25 Then you yourself said to me, “Purchase a field for yourself with silver and have witnesses witness it; though this city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.”’”
