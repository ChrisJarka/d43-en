  * cubit = 46 centimeters (18 inches)
  * furlong = 202 meters (660 feet)
  * span = 23 centimeters (9 inches)

There are different ways that units of measure for distance can be translated:

  - Spell the word in a way that is similar to the way the Bible term for that distance unit is spelled, or the way it sounds. Then give the equivalent value using a unit of distance or length that is known to the receptor culture. This explanation can be put in the text or in a note.
  - Directly use the equivalent distance or length in terms of the unit that is known to the receptor culture, without using the Bible name.
