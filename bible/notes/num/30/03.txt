<usfm>
\v 3 When a young woman living in her father's house makes a vow to Yahweh and binds herself with a promise,
\v 4 if her father hears the vow and the promise by which she has bound herself, and if he says nothing to reverse her, then all her vows will remain in force. Every promise by which she has bound herself will remain in force.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **has bound herself** - "has committed herself"
  * **to bind himself with a promise** - Here Moses speaks of a person promising to do something as if his promise were a physical object the he ties to himself. AT: "promising to do something" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **if he says nothing to reverse her** - "if he does not cancel her vow"
  * **then all her vows will remain in force. Every promise by which she has bound herself will remain in force** - These two statements said basically the same thing twice for emphasis. These two statements can be combined. AT: "then she must keep every vow and promise she made" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
