\v 12 Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to
the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished,
to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the
women),
\v 13 then in this wise came the maiden to the king: Whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of
the women to the kingâ€™s house.
