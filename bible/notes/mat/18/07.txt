\v 7 It will be terrible for those \f + \ft metonymy \f* who cause others to stop believing in me. \add God will punish them eternally\add*. It is inevitable that there will be \add those who\add* cause others to stop believing in me. But it will be horrible for everyone who does that.
\v 8 So, if you \add are wanting to use\add* one of your hands or feet to sin, \add stop using that hand or foot! Even if you have to\add* cut it off \add to avoid sinning, do it\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! It is good\add that you not sin and\add* go where you will live \add with God eternally, even though while you are still here on earth\add* you are maimed or lame and do not have a hand or a foot. But it is not good that you continue to have your two hands and two feet \add and do\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add the sinful things you want to, and as a result\add*, you are thrown into \add hell\add*, where there is eternal fire burning.

\v 7 How terrible it will be for those who cause others to stop believing in me. It is inevitable that there will be those who cause others to stop believing in me. But how terrible it will be for everyone who does that.
\v 8 So if you are wanting to use one of your hands or feet to sin, stop using that hand or foot! Even if you have to cut it off to avoid sinning, do it!  Suppose you had only one hand or one foot and still lived forever with God; that would be much better than if you had both hands and both feet and God threw you into the eternal fire in hell.

\v 7 Woe to the world because of times of stumbling! For it is necessary that those times come, but woe to the person through whom those times come!
\v 8 If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame, than to be thrown into the eternal fire having both hands or both feet.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Draft version:

  * **cut it off and throw it away-**  This phrase is a hyperbolic metaphor articulating the seriousness of sin and the necessity to avoid it at all costs.

Review version:

  * **Woe to the world** - "Terrible things will happen to the world" or "Terrible things will happen to the people of the world"
  * **the world** - "the people who live in the world"
  * **times of stumbling** - This metaphor compares the time when people stop believing in God to a time when people fall down and injure themselves. The purpose of the metaphor is to warn the audience how dangerous it is to refuse to obey God. (See: Metaphor)
  * **woe to the person** - Jesus switches from speaking about people in general, and now speaks more directly about individuals who cause other people not to believe in God. 
  * **If your hand** - Jesus now uses the singular "your" to speak directly and to the each person in the audience. Try to translate this in a way that shows the message become more personal. 
  * **If your hand or foot causes you to stumble** - Verse 6 continues to use stumbling as a metaphor not believing in God. If this metaphor will be understood, you should keep it in your translation.
  * **cut it off and throw it away** - It would be an extreme response for them to cut off a hand or a foot because they stumbled. Jesus is not saying they should do that, but is using the metaphor to show how serious it is to reject God. Anything that causes them to reject God must be removed from their lives, at any cost. 
  * **life...eternal fire** - Jesus ends the metaphor by contrasting eternal life and eternal punishment. If we remove the things that separate us from God, we will not miss them when we receive eternal life. But if we keep things that separate us from God, we will regret it when we are in eternal suffering. Make sure this contrast is clear in your translation.
