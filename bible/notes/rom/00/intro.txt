====== Introduction to Romans ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

=== Outline of the Book of Romans ===

  - Paul begins his letter by introducing himself and telling who it is that he is writing to (1:1-15)
  - Paul writes about the condition of mankind in sin and about salvation through Jesus Christ (1:16-11:36)
  - Paul gives practical instructions for Christian living (12:1-15:13)
  - Paul sends greetings to people in the church at Rome whom he knows personally (16:1-27)

=== What is the Book of Romans about? ===

Rome was the most important city in the Mediterranean area at that time. Paul wrote this letter to the Christians in Rome in order to get them ready to receive him as a visitor. He stated his purpose was to “bring about the obedience of faith” (16:26). 

In his letter to the Christians in Rome, Paul writes the fullest description of his understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He explains that God offers everyone his love and acceptance through Jesus Christ. This is true, even though there were at that time deep divisions between Jews and non-Jews.
 
=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Romans." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's Letter to the Church in Rome," or "A Letter to the Christians in Rome." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of Romans? ===

Paul from the city of Tarsus was the author. He had been known as Saul in his early life, when as a Pharisee he was a determined persecutor of Christians. After he began to trust in Jesus Christ, he made a number of missionary journeys in order to preach the gospel among both Jews and non-Jews living outside the land of Israel.

He probably wrote this letter while he was staying in the city of Corinth in Greece, on his third missionary journey. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What are the titles used to refer to Jesus? ===

In Romans, Paul describes Jesus Christ many titles and descriptions: Jesus Christ (1:1), the Seed of David (1:3), the Son of God (1:4), the Lord Jesus Christ (1:7), Christ Jesus (3:24), Propitiation (3:25), Jesus (3:26), Jesus our Lord (4:24), Lord of hosts  (9:29), a Stumbling Stone and Rock of Offence (9:33), the End of the Law (10:4), the Deliverer (11:26), Lord of the Dead and the Living (14:9),and the Root of Jesse  (15:12).

=== How should theological terms in Romans be translated? ===

Romans contains many theological terms that do not occur very much in the four gospels. As early Christians thought more about the meaning of Jesus Christ and his message, they realized that they needed words and expressions for new ideas, such as "justification" (5:1), "works of the law" (3:20), and "gospel" (2:16). Other such terms are "righteousness" (1:17), "grace" (1:7), "reconcile" (5:10), "salvation" (1:16), "propitiation" (3:25), "sanctification" (6:19), "glorify" (8:17), and "the old man" (6:6).

The "key terms" dictionary can help translators understand many of these terms. Also, because many of the terms are abstract concepts; see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns|abstract nouns]].

Terms such as those given above are complicated to explain. It is often hard or impossible for translators to find equivalent terms in their own languages. It can help to know that word equivalents of these terms are not necessary. Instead, translators are free to develop any short expressions they can in order to communicate these ideas. For example, the term "gospel" can be translated as, "the good news about Jesus Christ." "Grace" can be translated as, "God's kind gifts" or "God's acceptance of people," etc. 

Translators should also remember that some of these terms have more than one meaning, depending on the context in which it is used. For example, "righteousness" sometimes signals the idea that a person can perfectly obey God's law. At other times, "righteousness" signals the idea that Jesus Christ has obeyed God's law for us, and that God allows us to share in Christ's obedience.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====


=== What does Paul mean by being "in Christ" (3:24; 6:11, 23; 8:1,2,39; 9:1; 12:5,17; 15:17; 16:3,7,9,10)? ===

Paul uses a metaphor ("in Christ") to express the reality of the Christian believer's relationship to Jesus Christ. In this relationship, the believer is saved, is made into a friend with God, and is promised eternity with him. However, this idea can be difficult to represent in many languages, so translators must become very creative.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Romans? ===

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of Romans:\\

  * "who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit." (8:4) 
  * "But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work." (11:6)
  * "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen." (16:24) (so noted in ULB)

Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to the Book of Romans.
