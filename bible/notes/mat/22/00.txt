======  Matthew 22 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of verse 44, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Wedding Feast ==
This parable may pose difficulties in translation because weddings are not the same in different cultures. Jesus uses this hypothetical situation as a means of teaching people. A through understanding of the wedding practices of the ancient Near East is not necessary because this story is meant to be taken as an allegory. An allegory is a story which teaches using an analogous situation to make it point.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Implicit meaning ==
It is implicit, in many of the questions asked by the Pharisees, that they were trying to "trap" Jesus by asking him an impossible question. For example, when they asked him about taxes, they expected him to respond yes (angering the Jews) or no (angering the Romans). 

== Paradox ==
This is a statement that seems absurd or appears to contradict itself. In this chapter, Jesus quotes a psalm referencing that David calls his son "lord" or "master." At that time, the son served his father. Only Jesus could be both son and master.
