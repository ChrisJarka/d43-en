\v 4 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, even all
the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.
\v 5 For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they
came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.
