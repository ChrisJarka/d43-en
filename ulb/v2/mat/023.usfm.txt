\c 23
\p
\v 1 Then spoke Jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples,
\v 2 saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat:
\v 3 all things therefore whatever they command you, these do and observe: but do not you after their works; for they
say, and do not.
\v 4 Yea, they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move
them with their finger.
\v 5 But all their works they do to be seen of men: for they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders
of their garments,
\v 6 and love the chief place at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
\v 7 and the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called of men, Rabbi.
\v 8 But be not you called Rabbi: for one is your teacher, and all you are brethren.
\v 9 And call no man your father on the earth: for one is your Father,
even he who is in heaven.
\v 10 Neither be you called masters: for one is your master, even
the Christ.
\v 11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
\v 12 And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and whoever shall humble himself shall be exalted.
\p
\v 13 But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men: for you enter not
in yourselves, neither suffer you them that are entering in to enter.
\v 14 \f + Some authorities insert here, or after v. 12, v. 14 \fqa Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you
devour widows’ houses, even while for a pretense you make long prayours: therefore you shall receive greater
condemnation.\f*
\p
\v 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is become
so, you make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves.
\p
\v 16 Woe to you, you blind guides, that say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by
the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.
\v 17 You fools and blind: for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that has sanctified the gold?
\v 18 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, he is a
debtor.
\v 19 You blind: for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
\v 20 He therefore that swears by the altar, swears by it, and by all things thereon.
\v 21 And he that swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him that lives therein.
\v 22 And he that swears by the heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him that sits thereon.
\p
\v 23 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you tithe mint and anise and cummin, and have left undone the
weightier matters of the law, justice, and mercy, and faith: but these you ought to have done, and not to have left the other
undone.
\v 24 You blind guides, that strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel!
\p
\v 25 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within
they are full from extortion and excess.
\v 26 You blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside thereof may become clean
also.
\p
\v 27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like to whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear
beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.
\v 28 Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
\p
\v 29 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you build the sepulchres of the prophets, and garnish the tombs of
the righteous,
\v 30 and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
prophets.
\v 31 Wherefore you witness to yourselves, that you are sons of them that killed the prophets.
\v 32 Fill you up then the measure of your fathers.
\v 33 You serpents, you offspring of vipers, how shall you escape the judgment of hell?
\v 34 Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: some of them shall you kill and crucify; and some
of them shall you scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city:
\v 35 that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of
Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
\v 36 Verily I say to you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
\p
\v 37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent to her! how often would I have
gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!
\v 38 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
\v 39 For I say to you, You shall not see me henceforth, till you shall say, Blessed
is he that comes in the name of the Lord.
