    * **The proud garland of the drunkards of Ephraim will** - See Isaiah 28:1.
    * **will be trodden underfoot** - "will be trampled on by their enemies"
    * **The fading flower of his glorious beauty, that is on the head of the rich valley** - See Isaiah 28:1.
    * **will be as the first ripe fig...gulps it down** - This is comparing the destruction of Israel by its enemies to when someone sees the first good fig on a fig tree and quickly picks and eats it. In the same way, when the enemies of Israel see all the beauty of Samaria they will quickly plunder it and take away all its good things. (See: Metaphor)
