===== Translation Notes: =====

Nehemiah is recounting the numbers of how many people originally returned from exile to Jerusalem. Each family is grouped by their patriarch, or oldest living male relative.

  * **the number of the men **- a census had been taken when Israelites first returned to Jerusalem after the exile. The numbers represent how many men belonged to each family group.
  * **Parosh…Shephatiah…Arah**  - These are the names of the patriarch of each family group. Family groups would contain children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. (See: Translate Names).
