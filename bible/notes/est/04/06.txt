\v 6 So Hathach went forth to Mordecai to the broad place of the city, which was before the king’s gate.
\v 7 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to
the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
\v 8 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to
Esther, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and
to make request before him, for her people.
