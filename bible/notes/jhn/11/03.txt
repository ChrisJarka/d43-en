\v 3 So the two sisters sent someone to tell Jesus about Lazarus; they said, "Lord, the one you love is ill."
\v 4 When Jesus heard about Lazarus' illness, he said, "This illness will not end in the death of Lazarus. The purpose of this illness is so that people may see and know how great God is when he does wonderful things and so that I, the Son of God, also will show his great power."
