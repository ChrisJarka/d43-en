\v 27 But fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
\v 28 Fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, says Jehovah; for I am with thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven you; but I will not make a full end of you, but I will correct you in measure, and will in no wise
leave you unpunished.
