===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze? **- Job is using rhetorical questions to further explain his lack of desire to live, just as he did in verse 11. When translating "stones" or "bronze" consider using items that the reader would know are very tough and durable. AT: "I am not as strong as the rocks. My body is not made of metal." See: Rhetorical Question
  * **Is it not true that I have no help in myself? **- "I don't have any strength left."
  * **and that wisdom has been driven out of me **- "My success has been taken from me."
