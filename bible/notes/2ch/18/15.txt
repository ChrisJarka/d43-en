===== translationNotes: =====

  * **How many times must I require ... in the name of Yahweh?** - Ahab asks this question out of frustration to rebuke Micaiah. AT: "Many times I have required ... in the name of Yahweh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **in the name of Yahweh** - Here the word "name" refers to authority. AT: "as the representative of Yahweh" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **I saw all Israel** - Here "all Israel" refers to the army of Israel. AT: "I saw the entire army of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **like sheep who have no shepherd** - The people of the army are compared to sheep that have no one to lead them because their shepherd, the king, has died. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **These have no shepherd** - Yahweh speaks of the king as if he were a shepherd. Just like a shepherd is responsible to care for and protect his sheep, the king is responsible to lead and protect his people. AT: "These people no longer have a leader" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
