\v 16 I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
\v 17 And I will set my face against you, and you shall be struck before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and you shall flee when none pursueth you.
