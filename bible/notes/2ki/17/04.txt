\v 4 The king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea, for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and offered no tribute
to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.
\v 5 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria and besieged it three years.
\v 6 In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah and on the Habor River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
