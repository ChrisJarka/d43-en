====== Writing Styles ======

Also known as 'Discourse.'  Every story has a storyline. The storyline tells a series of events in chronological order and has a beginning, middle and end. It is full of types of words or phrases that moves the reader along the storyline. 

For Example:

  * **Background Information** - Occasionally an author may take a break from the storyline to share something of interest. This break usually contains background information.(See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:writingstyles_background]]) An author may use background information for several reasons: 1) to add interest to the story, 2) to provide important historical or cultural information or 3) to tell the reader, or listener, something very important.
  * **Therefore** - The word 'therefore' is used to mark the conclusion or reason for a discussion.  (See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:writingstyles_therefore]])
  * **Now** - The word "now" at the beginning of the sentence .... (See: [[en:ta:workbench:translate:writingstyles_now]])
