<usfm>
\q
\v 11 You rejoice, you celebrate the plundering of my inheritance;
\q you jump around like a calf stamping in its pasture;
\q you neigh like a powerful horse.
\q
\v 12 So your mother will be greatly ashamed; the one who bore you will be embarrassed.
\q See, she will be the least of nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
\q
\v 13 Because of Yahweh's anger, Babylon will not be inhabited, but will be a complete devastation.
\q Everyone who passes by will shudder because of Babylon and will hiss because all of its wounds.

 * **General Information:** - Yahweh is speaking to the people of Babylon.

  * **You rejoice** - "You people of Babylon rejoice" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **You rejoice, you celebrate** - These terms mean the same thing and are used to emphasize how happy they were to conquer Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **You rejoice ... you jump ... you neigh ... bore you** - Each instance of "You" or "you" is plural and refers to the people of Babylon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]])
  * **you jump around like a calf stamping in its pasture** - The people of Babylon are spoken of as a calf who runs around joyfully in a pasture. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **stamping** - Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:47:03|47:3]].
  * **you neigh like a powerful horse** - The people of Babylon are spoken of as stallions that are making loud noises because they are excited. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])

(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
