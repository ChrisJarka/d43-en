\v 12 The ten horns that you saw \add represent\add* ten rulers who have not yet begun to rule. They will receive authority in order to rule \add people\add* together with the beast \add for only a short time, as if it were\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* for one hour.
\v 13 Those \add rulers\add* will all agree to do the same thing. \add As a result\add* they will give to the beast their right \add to rule people\add* and their authority \add to rule people\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 14 The rulers and the beast will fight against \add Jesus\add*, the \add one who is like a\add* lamb.

\v 12 The ten horns that you saw represent ten rulers who have not yet begun to rule. They will receive authority in order to rule people together with the beast, but they will rule for only a short time, as if it were for only one hour.
\v 13 Those rulers will all agree to do the same thing. As a result they will give to the beast their right and authority to rule people.
\v 14 The rulers and the beast will fight against the lamb. He will defeat them because he is the Lord who rules over all other lords and the King who rules over all other kings. The people who are with him are the ones whom God has chosen and called to himself, and who keep serving him faithfully."

\v 12 The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they will receive authority as kings for one hour together with the beast.
\v 13 These are of one mind, and they give over their power and authority to the beast.
\v 14 They will make war against the Lamb. But the Lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of lords and King of kingsâ€”and with him are the called ones, the chosen, the faithful."
