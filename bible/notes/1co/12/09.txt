\v 9 And to another Christian the Spirit gives the gift of faith, to trust God and to believe his promises. And to another the ability to understand diseases and to find cures for them either from good medicine or from the power of God, or both. The Spirit gives a variety of gifts, but he is still the one Spirit of God.
\v 10 And to another Christian the Spirit gives the ability to work miracles for the glory of God. And to another, the gift of insight and powerful application of God's word. And to another, the Spirit gives various kinds of tongues, and to others the interpretation of those tongues into meaningful messages.
\v 11 Again and again we see the many different gifts, but the one Spirit giving these gifts to individuals. The Spirit gives these gifts as he chooses.
