===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **believe me** - To believe someone is to acknowledge that what that person has said is true.
  * **You people worship what you do not know. We worship that which we know** - Jesus means that God revealed himself and his commands to the Jewish people, not to the Samaritans. Through the scriptures the Jewish people know who God is better than the Samaritans.
  * **you will worship the Father...for salvation is from the Jews** - Eternal salvation from sin comes from God the Father, who is Yahweh, the God of the Jews. Jesus, the Son of God, is the God and Savior of all who believe in him. To retain the correct identity of the true God of eternal salvation, the God of the Bible, translate "Father" and "Son" as literally as possible in your language. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_sonofgodprinciples]])
  * **for salvation is from the Jews** - This does not mean the Jewish people will save others from their sins. It means God has chosen the Jews as his special people who will tell all other people about his salvation. AT: "for all people will know about God's salvation because of the Jews."
