\v 12 This will be the plague with which Yahweh will attack all the peoples that waged war against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot away even as they are standing on their feet. Their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
\v 13 It will happen on that day that great fear from Yahweh  will come among them. Each man will seize his neigbor's hand; each hand will be raised against its neighbor's hand.
