\v 29-32 Lord, you promised me that I would see the one \f + \ft metonymy \f* who would enable you to save people of all people-groups from the guilt of their sins. He will be \f + \ft metaphor \f* like a light that will reveal your truth to non-Jews, and he will cause people to think highly of your people, the Israelite people.
