  * Doing something "in the name of" a person means to do it on their behalf, or as if they were there.
  * Speaking "in the name of God" means speaking with his power and authority, or as his representative.
  * The "name" of someone can refer to the entire person, as in "there is no other nameâ€¦by which we must be saved."
