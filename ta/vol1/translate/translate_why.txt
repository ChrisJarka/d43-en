Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_manual|Introduction to Translation Manual]]

The Bible is the most influential book in history. It is God's message to mankind. The Church is commanded to make disciples by teaching people from every nation to observe everything that is contained in it.
//Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.// [ESV]
The original Bible was written in the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages. Few people today understand any of those languages. Therefore, the Bible must be translated so they can read and understand it. People continue to translate the Bible into the language of every people group so that God's message can change their lives.
