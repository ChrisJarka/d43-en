\c 16
\p
\v 1 And the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east, even the
wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill-country to Beth-el;
\v 2 and it went out from Beth-el to Luz, and passed along to the border of the Archites to Ataroth;
\v 3 and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, to the border of Beth-horon the nether, even to Gezer; and
the goings out thereof were at the sea.
\v 4 And the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
\p
\v 5 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was
thus: the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, to Beth-horon the upper;
\v 6 and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north; and the border turned about eastward to Taanath-shiloh,
and passed along it on the east of Janoah;
\v 7 and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah, and reached to Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.
\v 8 From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the
inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families;
\v 9 together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children
of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
\v 10 And they drove not out the Canaanites that lived in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this
day, and are become servants to do taskwork.
