**What is Job about?**
Job tells of the reality that God permits trials and loss to come into the lives of those who worship him. Earthly blessings do not always come to those who worship Yahweh. There may be some greater goal  to be made known in man's experiences, even when the experience causes suffering or sorrow. Job stands alone in its depth, in the way in which the ultimate answers are given by Yahweh, but his answers are not that the answers explain the sorrows or lose that Job experienced, but these answers are more about finding peace, no matter what the circumstance, in the nature and character of Yahweh.



**How should the title of this book be translated?**  \\ 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). The name "Job" is not related to the word "job" meaning an occupation or career. One possible title is "The book about Job."

**Who wrote Job?**\\
The author of Job is not known. Many suggest that Moses composed the book, but this conclusion is uncertain.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

**Does sin cause suffering?**\\
Sin does cause suffering, but this does not mean that suffering is cause by a person's sin. It was commonly held in the ancient Near East that a person suffered because of some sin in their life or in the lives of their parents. Many religions teach that the [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteous]] are blessed by their god or gods and the evil are punished by their god or gods.

**When does the book of Job take place?**\\
The exact date of the events of Job is unknown. It is likely that Job lived before Moses. Because of this, very little is known for certain about the religious and cultural context of the book. Many cultures have stories similar to Job because of the desire to know why the righteous suffer.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====
**What style of writing is Job?**\\
While the beginning and end of Job mostly contain narrative, there is a large portion of poetry in the book. Hebrew poetry is not so much about words rhyming as having one phrase reflect, describe, or expand on the meaning and focus of a previous section. There are many examples of this kind of poetry in ancient middle-east languages. The book is not concerned with producing a precise historical narrative because the lessons of the book are timeless.

**How do I translate the term "friends"?**\\
While the ULB uses the term "friends" in reference to Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, this is somewhat of a misnomer.  Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar were not really Job's friends. Instead, they tempted Job and gave his bad advise.  

**Is Job difficult to translate?**\\
Because Job is not connected with a specific historical context, the translator may wish to translate this book before other Old Testament books.  The translator should be aware that this book is very difficult to translate and may therefore be better left to near the end of translating the Old Testament.
