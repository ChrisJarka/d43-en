===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The man**  - This can also be translated as the name Adam. The name Adam is the same as the Hebrew word meaning "human being." Some translations say "Adam" and some say "the man."
  * **called his wife's name**  - Adam "gave his wife a name," or, "named his wife" (UDB).
  * **Eve** - Translators may write a footnote saying, "The name Eve sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'living.'"
  * **all living things**  - "This could be translated as "all the living," since it refers to people.
  * **garments of skins**  - This could be translated "garments made out of animal hide." "Skins" refers to the material used to make the garments.
