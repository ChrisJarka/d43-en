=== What is the Book of 1 Corinthians about? ===

1 Corinthians is a book about conflicts among believers in the church in the city of Corinth. Paul had heard many bad reports about the believers' actions. Some of their problems included theological or doctrinal issues, but most of them were about bad behavior. This letter is Paul's response and encouragement for the Christians in Corinth to live in a God-pleasing way.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "First Corinthians" or "Paul's first Letter to the Church in Corinth." This letter is actually the first of two letters to the Corinthian Christians that are in the New Testament. There was at least one earlier letter, but that letter no longer exists. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of 1 Corinthians? ===

Paul of Tarsus was the author. He probably wrote from Ephesus after he lived for some time in Corinth and planted the church there. Paul had been known as “Saul” before his conversion to Christ, when he had been a persecutor of the church. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What was the city of Corinth like? ===

Corinth was a major city located in ancient Greece. Because it was near the Mediterranean Sea, many people bought and sold goods there. This caused the city to have people from many different cultures. It was known for its immorality. Its religious practices centered on Aphrodite, the goddess of love. As part of the ceremonies honoring Aphrodite, her worshipers had sexual intercourse with temple prostitutes.

=== What is meat sacrificed to idols? ===

Many animals were slaughtered and sacrificed to the gods in Corinth. However, much of the meat was kept by the priests and worshipers, and much of it was sold in markets. Many Christians disagreed with each other over whether it was right for them to eat this meat. Paul writes about this problem in 1 Corinthians.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the meaning of "flesh?" ===

Paul frequently uses the terms "flesh" or "fleshly" to refer to Christians who follow their own sinful desires. Despite the imagery, it is not the physical world which is evil. Paul also describes Christians who live [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteously]] as "spiritual" people because they follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit. 

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Corinthians? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of manuscripts that many believe are more accurate. The follow are the most significant issues in the Book of 1 Corinthians:\\

  * "and in your spirit, which are God's." (6:20) 
  * "though not being myself under the law" (9:20) (so noted in ULB **by parentheses ?**)

Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to the Book of 1 Corinthians.
