====== Add New Important Terms to Notes Page ======

This page explains the process of requesting a new Important Term link on the page.


==== Team Members ====

Before requesting a new Key Term for a page, check here to see if a page for the term already exists:

  * [[:en:obe:home|Complete list of Important Terms]]

If a page for the term exists, make a note in the discussion requesting that the link be added.

If a page for the term does note exist, :

  - Make a note in the discussion explaining why you think the terms should be added to the list.
  - Notify your team leader about your request.


==== Team Leaders ====

When you are informed that a term with an existing page needs to be added to a notes page, do the following:

  - Insert the name of the term into the Important Terms list (do not create the link).
  - Alert the text team by adding the tag "ktlink" to the tags on the notes page, as in the examples below:

<code>
{{tag>draft ktlink}}

{{tag>draft ktlink jesus bethleman sonofgod}}

</code>

When you are informed that a new term page needs to be created, notify your notes team manager via email about the specific chunk and term. 


==== Team Managers ====

Email the KT team managers (Andrew and Lizz) that a new term page has been requested for a specific notes page. 


==== KT Team Managers ====

The KT team managers will:

  * Check the terms admin page to see which pages have "ktlink" tags and need to have additional existing terms linked. Once they have linked the terms, they will delete the "ktlink" tag.
  * Follow up on email requests for new terms from the team managers, and create terms as needed.
