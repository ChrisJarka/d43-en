===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Those teachers of false doctrine are \add as dangerous to you as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* â—„hidden rocks on a reef\f + \ft Or: rocks underneath the surface of the ocean \f* \add are to a boat\add*. When you gather together \add to eat the meals that\add* help you believers to love each other more and have a closer relationship with each other, they \add join you and\add* carouse shamelessly, caring \add only\add* for themselves \add and not for others. Because they do not do anything to help others\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, they are \add as useless as\add* clouds that are blown along by the wind \f + \ft Or:that the wind blows along \f* but that do not \add produce, Or: give\add* any rain. \add They are as disappointing as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* trees that do not produce fruit in the autumn \add as we expect them to\add*. They are not only \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* dead themselves, \add but they are\add* not \add able to cause others to be\add* alive \add spiritually, just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* trees that have been \f + \ft Or:that \add someone\add* has \f* uprooted and \add as a result\add* are unable to produce any fruit.
\v 13 They are \add restless\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like\add* the pounding waves of the ocean. \add Just like\add* waves \add produce foul-smelling\add* foam on the shore, \add those teachers of false doctrine do\add* shameful \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add deeds. We cannot depend\f + \ft Or: rely \f* on them to show us how to conduct our lives\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like we cannot depend\f + \ft Or: rely \f* on\add* meteors\f + \ft Or: falling stars \f* \add to show us the way when we travel\add*. \add God\add* has reserved intense darkness for them forever \add in hell\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 These people are like rocks under the water that ships crash against. When they share in your love-feasts, they have no shame, because they eat only to please themselves. They are like clouds that give no rain, clouds that the wind pushes along. They do no good deeds, for they are like trees in late autumn that bear no fruit. They are like people who have died two times; they are like trees that have been uprooted.
\v 13 They do not control themselves. They are like the sea's strong waves in a storm, and they pollute others with their shame, just as the waves bring up foam and dirt onto the beaches. They are like stars that do not stay where they should in the sky. God will put them in very great darkness forever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 These are the ones who are hidden reefs in your love-feasts when they feast with you, shamelessly caring only for themselves; they are clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, torn up by the roots;
\v 13 wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved for ever.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jude continues with a series of metaphors. 
  * **These are the ones** - "These" refers to the ungodly men first mentioned in 1:04
  * **who are hidden reefs** - As under water rocks are a danger to ships, so are these people a danger to the believers. Alternate Translation: "who are like dangerous rock hidden under water." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **in your love-feasts, when they feast with you** - "in you fellowship meals, when they eat with you".
  * **clouds without water** -  Just as clouds that do not provide water to the gardens, these people do not care for the believers. 
  * **autumn trees without fruit** - Just as some trees do not produce fruit at the end of summer, so these ungodly people do not have faith and works of righteousness. 
  * **without fruit, twice dead** -  Just as trees that have been killed twice such as by frost would not give fruit these the ungodly men have no values and contain no life within them.
  * **torn up by the roots** -  Just as trees that have been completely pulled out of the ground by their their roots, the ungodly people have been separated from God who is the source of life. 
  * **wild waves of the sea** -  the sea's waves blown by a strong storm. (As a metaphor, this states that the ungodly people had not foundation of faith and were easily moved in many directions.  See Metaphor).
  * **foaming out of their own shame** - the waves are not blown by the wind, but are foaming because of their own guilt or regret. (As a metaphor, this states that the ungodly people are driven in many directions by their own sense of guilt. See Metaphor)
  * **wandering stars for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever** -  these wandering stars will never approach other stars or lights in the sky.  (As a metaphor, these ungodly people are without a path, and will never know God.  See Metaphor)
