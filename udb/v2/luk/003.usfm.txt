\v 1 When the Emperor Tiberius had been ruling the Roman Empire for fifteen years, and while Pontius Pilate was the governor of Judea district, and Herod Antipas was ruling Galilee district, and his brother Philip was ruling Iturea and Trachonitis districts, and Lysanius was ruling Abilene district,
\v 2 and while Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests in Jerusalem, God gave messages to Zechariah's son John while he was living in the desolate region.
\v 3 So John went all over the area close to the Jordan River. He kept telling people, "If you want God to forgive you for your sins, you must repent before you ask me to baptize you!"
\p
\v 4 John was the one who fulfilled these words that had been written by the prophet Isaiah  on a scroll long ago:
\pi In a desolate area, someone  will be heard shouting to the people who pass by,
\pi Prepare yourselves to receive the Lord when he comes!
\pi Make yourselves ready so that you will be prepared when he comes,
\pi just like people straighten out the road !
\pi
\v 5 Just like people level off all the places where the land rises and just like they fill all the ravines,
\pi and just like people make the road straight wherever it is crooked,
\pi and just like people make smooth the bumps in the road,
\pi Similarly you need to remove all the obstacles which prevent God from blessing you!
\pi
\v 6 Then people  people.
\p
\v 7 Although large groups of people came to John to be baptized 
\v 8 Do the deeds that are appropriate for people who have truly turned from their sinful behavior! God promised to give Abraham many descendants. In order to fulfill that promise, God does not need you! I tell you that he can change these stones to make them descendants of Abraham! So do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We are descendants of Abraham, so God will not punish us, even though we have sinned!'
\v 9 God is ready to punish you if you do not turn away from your sinful behavior, just like a man ."
\p
\v 10 Then various ones in the crowd asked him, "What shall we do to escape God punishing us (OR), to show that we have repented?"
\v 11 He answered them, "If any of you has two shirts, you should give one of them to someone who has no shirt. If any of you has plenty of food, you should give some to those who have no food."
\v 12 Some tax collectors came and asked to be baptized  do to please God?"
\v 13 He said to them, "Do not take from the people any more money than the Roman government tells you to take!"
\v 14 Some soldiers asked him, "What about us? What should we do not give me some money, I will hurt you,' and do not takepeople to court and falsely accuse them of doing something wrong! And be content with your wages."
\p
\v 15 People were expecting that the Messiah would come soon. Because of that, many of them wondered about John. Some of them asked him if he was the Messiah.
\v 16 John replied to them all, "No, I am not. I used only water when I baptized you. But the Messiah will soon come! He is far greater than I am. He is so great that I am not worthy to be like his slave and untie his sandals  in hell.
\v 17 He is like a man ."
\p
\v 18 John kept telling them many things to urge them to turn to God, as he told them the good message from God.
\v 19 He also rebuked the ruler of the district, Herod Antipas. He rebuked him for marrying Herodias, his brother's wife, while his brother was still alive, and for doing many other evil things.
\v 20 But Herod had his soldiers put John in prison. That was another evil thing he did.
\s Luke 3:21-22
\sr John baptized Jesus.
\p
\v 21 But before John was put in prison, when many people were being baptized  and Jesus was praying, the sky opened.
\v 22 Then the Holy Spirit, resembling a dove, descended upon Jesus. And God [SYN are my Son, the one whom I love dearly. I am very pleased with you!"
