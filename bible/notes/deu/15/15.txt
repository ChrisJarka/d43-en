===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 Do not forget that your ancestors were once slaves in Egypt, and Yahweh our God freed them. That is the reason that I am now commanding you to do this.
\p
\v 16 But one of your slaves may say, 'I do not want to leave you.' He loves you and your family, because you have treated him well.
\v 17 If he says that, take him to the door of your house and, \add while he stands against the doorway\add*, pierce one of his earlobes with an awl\f + \ft Or: a sharp pointed tool \f*. That will indicate that he will be your slave for the rest of his life. Do the same thing to any female slave \add who does not want to leave you\add*.

\v 15 And you shall remember that you was a bondman in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah your God redeemed thee: therefore I command you this thing to-day.
\v 16 And it shall be, if he say to you, I will not go out from you; because he loves you and your house, because he is well with thee;
\v 17 then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant for ever. And also to your female servant you shall do likewise.
