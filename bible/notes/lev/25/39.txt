\v 39 And if your brother be waxed poor with thee, and sell himself to thee; you shall not make him to serve as a bond-servant.
\v 40 As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with you; he shall serve with you to the year of jubilee:
\v 41 then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers shall he return.
