\v 8 Even though what \add I wrote\add* in my letter distressed you\f + \ft Or: made you sad \f*, I am not sorry \add that I wrote it\add*. For a while I was sorry that I had written it, \add because I knew that it would distress you\add*. Now \add Titus has also told\add* me that it did distress you \add when you read it\add*, but you were distressed only for a short time.
\v 9 \add So now\add* I am happy \add that I wrote it\add*. I am not happy that you were distressed \f + \ft Or:that \add I\add* distressed you \f*, but \add I am happy\add* because, when you became distressed, you became sorry for what you had done and \add you asked God to forgive you. What I mean is that you became sorry in the way that God wanted you to be sorry, so my making\add* you sorry did not harm you at all.
\v 10 \add The fact is that\add* when God causes \add us to be\add* truly sorry for having sinned and we turn from our sinful behavior, then God saves us \add and will not punish us for the sinful things that we have done\add*. And no one is ever sorry about that. \add However\add*, the people who do not trust \add in God\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* may be sorry \add for the sinful things that they have done\add*. But \add if they do not turn from their sinful behavior and ask God to forgive them\add*, they will remain separated from him forever.

\v 8 Even though what I wrote in my letter distressed you, I am not sorry that I wrote it. For a while I was sorry that I had written it, because I knew that it would distress you. Now Titus has also told me that it did distress you when you read it, but you were distressed only for a short time.
\v 9 So now I am happy that I wrote it. I am not happy that you were distressed , but I am happy because, when you became distressed, you became sorry for what you had done and you asked God to forgive you. What I mean is that you became sorry in the way that God wanted you to be sorry, so my making you sorry did not harm you at all.
\v 10 The fact is that when God causes us to be truly sorry for having sinned and we turn from our sinful behavior, then God saves us and will not punish us for the sinful things that we have done. And no one is ever sorry about that. However, the people who do not trust in God  may be sorry for the sinful things that they have done. But if they do not turn from their sinful behavior and ask God to forgive them, they will remain separated from him forever.

\v 8 Even if I hurt you with my letter, I do not regret it (although I did regret it since I see that that letter made you sorry but only for a short time),
\v 9 I now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance; for you were made sorry after a godly sort, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing.
\v 10 For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, a repentance which brings no regret: but the sorrow of the world works death.
