\v 10 And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You shall surely recover; howbeit Jehovah has showed me that he shall
surely die.
\v 11 And he settled his countenance stedfastly upon him, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
\v 12 And Hazael said, Why weeps my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of
Israel: their strongholds will you set on fire, and their young men will you kill with the sword, and will dash in pieces
their little ones, and rip up their women with child.
