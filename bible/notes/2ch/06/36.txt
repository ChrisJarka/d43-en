\v 36 \add It is true that\add* everyone \f + \ft litotes \f* sins. So, when your people sin against you, and you become angry with them, you may allow their enemies to capture them and take them to their countries, even to countries that are far away.

\p
\v 36 If they sin against you (for there is no man that sins not), and you be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near;
\v 37 yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;
\v 38 if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name:
\v 39 then hear you from heaven, even from your dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against thee.
