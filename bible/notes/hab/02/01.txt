===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **I...my**  - The words "I" and my refer to Habakkuk.
    * **he**  - The word "he" refers to Yahweh.
    * **I will stand at my guard-post and station myself on the watch-tower** - These phrases say the same thing in two different ways. "I will stand at my post on the watchtower" (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])  Habakkuk uses these phrases to compare himself waiting to hear from God to a soldier waiting on a watchtower. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
    * **I should turn from my complaint** - The word "turn" compares someone changing their mind to turning from one thing to another. "I should stop complaining and agree with God." (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])
