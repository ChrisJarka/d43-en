<usfm>
\v 11 All those who touch a corpse will be unacceptable to me for seven days.
\v 12 On the third day and on the seventh day \add after touching a corpse\add*, in order to become acceptable to me again, \add they must sprinkle on themselves\add* some of that water for removing the guilt of their sin. If they do not do that on both of those days, they will continue to be unacceptable to me.
\v 13 All those who touch a corpse, and do not perform in the correct way the ritual to become acceptable to me again, defile Yahweh's Sacred Tent. They will no longer belong to the Israelite people. The water to remove the guilt of sin was not sprinkled on them, so they continue to be unacceptable to me.

\v 11 He who touches the dead body of any man will be unclean seven days.
\v 12 The same man will purify himself on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean. But if he purifies not himself the third day, then the seventh day he will not be clean.
\v 13 Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and does not purify himself, he defiles the tabernacle of  Yahweh. That soul will be cut off from Israel because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him. He will be unclean and his uncleanness is yet upon him.
