===== Translation Notes: =====

David continues to pray to Yahweh.
  * **by your covenant faithfulness** - Because Yahweh's covenant faithfulness is so great, David thinks that Yahweh will save him. AT: "because your covenant faithfulness is so great." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **May they know that this is your doing** - "Then they will know that this is your hand." It is implied that they will know that Yahweh saved David because no one else could have saved him. AT: "Then they will know your power saved me, because no one else could save me."
  * **May they** - The word "they" refers to David's accusers and the people who say bad things about him.
  * **that you, Yahweh, have done this** - AT: "and they will know that you, Yahweh, have saved me." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
