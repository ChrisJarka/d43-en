\v 11 So this is the meaning of that parable: The seeds \add represent\add* God's message.
\v 12 \add Some people are like\add* the path on which some of \add the seeds fell\add*. When these people hear God's message, the devil comes and causes them to forget what they have heard. As a result, they do not believe it and will not be saved \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will not save them \f*.
\v 13 \add Some people are like\add* the \add soil with\add* rock \add underneath\add*. When they hear \add God's\add* message, they accept it joyfully. \add But because it does not penetrate deeply\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add into their inner beings\add*, they believe it for \add only\add* a \add short\add* time. \add They are like the plants that\add* did not have \add deep\add* roots. When difficult things happen to them, they stop believing \add God's message\add*.

\v 11 Now, this is what the story means: The seeds represent God's word.
\v 12  The seeds that fell on the pathway show what happens when people hear God's word,  but afterwards the devil comes and takes that word away from their minds and hearts. As a result, they do not believe it and are not saved.
\v 13 The seeds that fell on the rocky ground show what happens when people hear God's word and receive it joyfully, but they do not have deep roots. As a result, they only believe for a short time. As soon as difficult things happen to them, they stop believing God's word.

\v 11 Now this is what the parable means: The seed is the word of God.
\v 12 The seeds that fell by the wayside are people who have heard the word but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved.
\v 13 Then, the ones that fell on the rocky ground are people who, when they have heard the word, receive it with joy,  but they do not have any roots;  they only believe for a while, and then during a time of testing they fall away.
