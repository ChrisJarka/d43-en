Sample notes from Jim's revisions:

  * **For just as the sufferings of Christ abound for our sake** - Paul speaks of Christ's sufferings as if they were objects that could increase in number. AT: "For just as Christ suffered greatly for our sake"  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **our comfort abounds** - Paul speaks of comfort as if it were an object that could increase in size (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **abound in glory** - Paul speaks of the work that Christ did as if it were an object that could produce another object. He means that Christ's service of righteousness is far more glorious than the law, which also had glory. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **unveiled faces, see the glory of the Lord** - Unveiling a person's face allows him to see clearly and also refers to being able to understand. The word "seeing" refers to the ability to understand something. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

  * **strangers to the covenants of the promise** - Paul speaks to the Gentile believers as if they had been foreigners, kept out of the land of God's covenant and promise. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **you were dead in your trespasses and sins** - This shows how sinful people are unable to obey God in the same way a dead person is unable to respond physically. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **children of wrath** - people with whom God is angry (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
