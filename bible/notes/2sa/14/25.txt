\v 25 Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the
crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
\v 26 And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him,
therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king’s weight.
\v 27 And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair
countenance.
