\v 5 Yahweh replied to me,
\q1 "This is happening, but look around at what is happening in the other nations.
\q2 If you look, you will be amazed, and even astonished, since I am doing something
\q1 during this time that you would never have believed would happen,
\q2 even if someone told you about it.
\q1
\v 6 Very soon I will bring the soldiers of Babylonia, who are fierce and swift.
\q1 They will march across the entire earth
\q2 and conquer many other countries.
\q1
\v 7 They are a people whom others fear very much,
\q2 and they do whatever they want to,
\q2 because they believe that they are very great and that they have the right to judge everyone else.

\q
\v 5 "Look at the nations and examine them; be amazed and astonished!
\q For I am surely about to do something in your days that you will not believe when it is reported to you.
\q
\v 6 For look! I am about to raise up the Chaldeans—that fierce and impetuous nation—
\q they are marching throughout the breadth of the land to seize homes that were not their own.
\q
\v 7 They are terrifying and fearsome; their judgment and splendor proceed from themselves.
