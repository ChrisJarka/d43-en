\p
\v 5 O house of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the light of Yahweh..
\v 6 For you have abandoned your people the house of Jacob, because they are filled
with customs from the east  and are omen readers like the Philistines, and they strike bargains with the
 foreigners.
 
 
 \v 7 Their land is full of silver and gold, and is there no end of their treasures; their land also is full of horses,
and is there any end to their chariots.
\v 8 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.
