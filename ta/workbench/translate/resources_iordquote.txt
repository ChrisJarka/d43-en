===== Indirect to Direct Quote =====

==== Description =====

There are two kinds of quotations: direct quotation and indirect quotation. When translating a quotation, translators need to decide whether to translate it as a direct quotation or an indirect quotation.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])

When there is an indirect quote in the ULB, the notes may have an option for a direct quote. The translation suggestion will start with "It can be translated as a direct quote:" followed by the new phrase.

Notice that there is a link to the tA page with more information about Direct Quotes and translation strategies for the translator to accurately translate the passage according to the form of the target language.

==== Translation Notes Examples ====

> He instructed him to tell no one (Luke 5:14 ULB)

  * **to tell no one**  - This can be translated as a direct quote: "Do not tell anyone." The implied information is "that you have been healed." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])

Here the translation suggestion is to change the passage with the indirect quote of what Jesus said to a direct quote.
