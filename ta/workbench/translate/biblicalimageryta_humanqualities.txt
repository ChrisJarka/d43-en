===== Description =====

Biblical imagery uses ideas to represent other ideas. For example one image in the Bible involves the idea of MASTER. The idea of MASTER represents ANYTHING THAT MOTIVATES SOMEONE OR SOMETHING TO ACT. In Matthew 6:24 below, God and wealth are represented as masters because both can motivate people to act. A person will either serve God by doing what God motivates him to do, or he will serve wealth by doing what wealth motivates him to do.

  * **No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.** (Matthew 6:24)

In the example above, the idea of MASTER is stated explicitly with the words "serve" and "masters".

Very often, a key idea is only implied in a passage; it might not be stated explicitly. For example, in Isaiah 55:11 below,  the idea of MASTER is implied by what God says about his word. Just as masters send their servants to do things and their servants do what they want and then return to their masters, God is the master, and he speaks his word and it does what he wants. \\ 
  * **so also my word will be that goes from my mouth: it will not return to me uselessly, but it will accomplish that which I wish, and it will succeed in that for which I sent it.** Isaiah 55:11
