\v 51 Have you understood all these things?" The disciples said to him, "Yes."
\v 52 Then Jesus said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like a man
who is the owner of a house, who brings forth out of his treasure old things and new things."
\v 53 Then it came about that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from that place.
