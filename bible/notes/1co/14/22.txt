\v 22 Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving. But prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.
\v 23 If therefore the whole church is assembled together and all speak in other languages, and people who are not believers or do not understand come in will they not say that you are maniacs?
