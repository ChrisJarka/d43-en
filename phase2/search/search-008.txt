====== Search 008: See Verse Ref. (23) ======

~~NOCACHE~~

The script on this page searches for a string of text anywhere in the notes, the ULB, and the UDB. To modify the search, open in edit view and change the text between the quotation marks following the -q.  

//Note: Special characters and symbols must be preceded by a backslash "\".//

This search is to find references where note states "verse x:y". 
  - Verse is not to be included 
  - all verse references are to be links.


Some search string ideas:
  * "verse", "see verse", "in verse"
  * " v."
  * " v "
