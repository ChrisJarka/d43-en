\v 13 So he and Nebushazban, who was one of their chief officers, and Nergal-Sharezer the king's advisor, and other officers of the king of Babylon
\v 14 sent some men to bring me out of the courtyard outside of the palace. They took me to Gedaliah who was the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. Then Gedaliah took me to my home, and I stayed in Judah among my own people \add who had been allowed to remain there\add*.

\v 11 Also, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had commanded the hand of Nebuzaradan the chief guard concerning Jeremiah, and said,
\v 12 “Take him and set your eyes upon him and do not do to him anything evil, for just as he declares to you, so you do with him.”
\v 13 So Nebuzaradan the chief guard, Nebushazban the high eunuch, Nergal-Sharezer the high official, and all the officials of all the chiefs of the king of Babylon sent out,
\v 14 and they sent out and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard and gave him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home, so he lived among the people.
