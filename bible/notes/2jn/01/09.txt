\v 9 Those who change what Christ taught and do not continue \add to believe\add* what he taught do not have\add a relationship with\add* God. \add But\add* those who continue to believe \add what Christ\add* taught have \add a close relationship with\add* both \add God, our\add* Father, and with his Son\f + \ft Or: the one who is also God \f*.
\v 10 So when anyone comes to you who teaches something different from \add what Christ\add* taught, do not welcome him into your homes! Do not \add encourage him by\add* wishing him well\f + \ft Or: greeting him as a fellow believer \f* \add in any way!\add*
\v 11 \add I say that\add* because if you treat people like that as you would treat a fellow believer, \add God will punish you\add* along with them for the evil that they do.

\v 9 Those who change what Christ taught and do not continue to believe what he taught do not havea relationship with God. But those who continue to believe what Christ taught have a close relationship with both God, our Father, and with his Son.
\v 10 So when anyone comes to you who teaches something different from what Christ taught, do not welcome him into your homes! Do not encourage him by wishing him well in any way!
\v 11 I say that because if you treat people like that as you would treat a fellow believer, God will punish you along with them for the evil that they do.

\v 9 Whosoever goes onward and remains not in the teaching of Christ, has not God: he that remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.
\v 10 If any one comes to you, and brings not this teaching, receive him not into your house, and give him no greeting:
\v 11 for he that gives him greeting partaketh in his evil works.
