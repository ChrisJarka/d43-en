====== Possession ======

===== Description =====

This module answers the question: What is possession?

Possession refers to a special relationship between two nouns, when one noun belongs to, or defines, or describes the other noun in some way. The English language often shows possession with the word “of,” as in, “the love of God,” or by using an apostrophe and the letter “s,” as in, “God’s love,” which can mean the love that God possesses. However, a relationship between nouns can have several other meanings that this page will describe.

**Definition**: Possession literally refers to the relationship between two nouns in which one owns the other. Also, possession may refer to the close relationship two nouns can have with each other, and the various ways those nouns can be related and the meanings that can result.

=== Reason this could be a translation issue ===

When two nouns are connected by the word “of” in the Bible, as in “the love of God,” the meaning can be unclear. Does “the love of God” refer to God’s love for us, or to our love for God, or to something else? This page seeks to provide help with how to translate phrases where two nouns are joined by “of” in the Bible.

=== Translation Principles (optional) ===

The list below explains the possible special relationships between two nouns that could apply in a passage you are translating. Use this information to help you determine how best to translate related nouns, which occur very often in the Bible.

Seek to understand the relationship of the nouns in the original context, and work to make sure your translation makes that relationship clear. The context should clarify which possible meaning from below is actually meant.

One noun (or pronoun) can be related to another noun (or pronoun) in several different ways:
These verse quotations are from the ULB, and then they are retranslated to describe the meaning.
  - **Description**: when the noun after “of” describes the other noun\\ Mark 1:4 - “a baptism of repentance,” meaning,  “a repentance kind of baptism,”
  - **Ownership**: when the noun after “of” owns the other noun
         Ephesians 3:1 - “the prisoner of Jesus Christ,” meaning, “the prisoner who belongs to Jesus Christ”
  - **Identity**: when the noun after “of” has the same identity as the other noun
       Acts 10:45 - “the gift of the Holy Spirit,” meaning, “the gift which is the Holy Spirit” 
  - **Subject**: when the noun after “of” produces or causes the other noun\\
       2 Corinthians 5:14 - “the love of Christ,” could mean, “the love that Christ produces”\\
          Christ would be the subject who produces the love.\\
       Acts 12:11 - “the expectation of the people of the Jews,” meaning, “the expectation the the Jews caused”\\
  - **Object**: when the noun after “of” is the object of the action done by the other noun\\
       2 Corinthians 5:14 - “the love of Christ,” could mean, “the love for Christ”\\   
          Christ would be the object who receives love from those who love him.\\
     Matthew 12:31 - “blasphemy against the Spirit,” meaning, the Spirit is the object of blasphemy\\
  - **Whole**: when the noun/pronoun after “of” is a group in which the other noun/pronoun is a part\\
       Ephesians 4:7 - “To each one of us has been given a gift ”—“each” refers to the parts of the whole group,\\ 
       and the whole group is “us”
