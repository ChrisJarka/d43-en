<usfm> \q1 \v 17 The light of Israel will become a fire, and her Holy One a flame; \q1 it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day. \q1 \v 18 Yahweh will consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful land, both soul and body; \q1 it will be like when a sick man's life wastes away. \q1 \v 19 The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few, that a child could count them. </usfm>

  * [[:en:obe:kt:holyone|Holy One]]

  * [[:en:obe:kt:remnant|remnant]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The light of Israel**- This is Yahweh.
  * **will become a fire- **  Yahweh's wrath is again compared to a fire as seen also in verse 16. (See: Simile)
  * **and ****her Holy One a flame**- This phrase is also describing Yahweh. (See: Doublet)
  * **his thorns and briers**- The Assyrian army is being compared to dry, brittle thorns and briers, which would easily burn up. (See: Metaphor)
  * **Yahweh will consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful land, soul and body**- This can be translated as "Yahweh will completely destroy the glorious farmlands". The phrase "soul and body" here either means the farmlands were completely destroyed or Isaiah is switching to a new metaphor having the "farmlands" actually mean the people of Assyria, since land does not have a soul or body.
