\v 21 And say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations,
whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
\v 22 and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and
they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;
\v 23 neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their
transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so
shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
