  * **"whose way is hidden"**  - the idea is that Job feels as though God has taken his future from him.
  * **"a man whom God has hedged in" **- the idea is that Job feels confined by the disasters that have happened to him.
  * **"for my sighing happens instead of eating" **- "Sighing" is referring to Job grieving the loss of his children. He is so grieved he cannot eat.
  * **"my groaning is poured out like water"**  - this sentence is used to intensify the description of Job's grief. (See: Parallelism)
  * **"poured out like water"**  - Job is using a simile to describe the way his grief comes out of his mouth. (See: Simile)
