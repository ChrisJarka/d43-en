\v 23 But the Levites will do the service of the tent of meeting and they will be responsible for any sin regarding it. It will be a statute forever for this and future generations. But among the people of Israel they will have no inheritance.
\v 24 For the tithes of the people of Israel, which they offer as a presented offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance. Therefore I have said to them, 'Among the people of Israel they will have no inheritance.'"
