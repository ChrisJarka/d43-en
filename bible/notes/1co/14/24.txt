\v 25 He will realize that \add God knows the evil things that he has done that\add* other people do not know. Then he will kneel down and worship God and say, "God is truly among you!"

\v 24 But if you were all prophesying (each in his turn), an unbeliever would be able to understand what was being said, and could be convicted of his sin by what he hears, and he could understand he is under the judgment of God for what he has done,
\v 25 and the secrets of his heart would be revealed as the Spirit takes the word and opens his understanding so he can be convicted, and he would fall on his face in prayer to God, and, at the end, he would worship God and declare that God is truly among you.

\v 24 But if you all were prophesying and an unbeliever or an outsider came in, he would be convicted by all he hears, he would be judged by all that is said,
\v 25 and the secrets of his heart would be revealed so that, falling on his face, he would worship God and declare that God is really among you.
