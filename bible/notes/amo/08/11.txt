\v 11 Behold, the days come, says the Lord Jehovah, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst
for water, but of hearing the words of Jehovah.
\v 12 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of
Jehovah, and shall not find it.
