\v 11 Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be
lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this:
\v 12 and the God that has caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples that shall put forth their hand to
alter the same, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with
all diligence.
