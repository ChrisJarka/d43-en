\c 57
\d For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm
of David. Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave.
\q
\v 1 Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me;
\q For my soul takes refuge in thee:
\q Yea, in the shadow of your wings will I take refuge,
\q Until these calamities be overpast.
\q
\v 2 I will cry to God Most High,
\q To God that performeth all things for me.
\q
\v 3 He will send from heaven, and save me,
\q When he that would swallow me up reproacheth; \qs [Selah\qs*
\q God will send forth his lovingkindness and his truth.
\q
\v 4 My soul is among lions;
\q I lie among them that are set on fire,
\q Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,
\q And their tongue a sharp sword.
\q
\v 5 Be you exalted, O God, above the heavens;
\q Let your glory be above all the earth.
\b
\q
\v 6 They have prepared a net for my steps;
\q My soul is bowed down:
\q They have digged a pit before me;
\q They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed:
\q I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.
\q
\v 8 Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp:
\q I myself will awake right early.
\q
\v 9 I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, among the peoples:
\q I will sing praises to you among the nations.
\q
\v 10 For your lovingkindness is great to the heavens,
\q And your truth to the skies.
\q
\v 11 Be you exalted, O God, above the heavens;
\q Let your glory be above all the earth.
