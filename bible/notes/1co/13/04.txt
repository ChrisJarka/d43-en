===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 4 Love is able to wait and it knows how to be kind. Love has no envy and it does not praise itself. Love does not put itself before anyone else,
\v 5 and love does not speak harshly. Love does not serve itself, but it serves others. Love does not lose its temper and it does not keep a list of the wrongs done to it by others.
\v 6 Love does not rejoice when people break God's rules, but it celebrates when the truth is told.
\v 7 Love puts up with anything that happens, and it trusts in God through every kind of trial. Love has great hope that God will provide all that is needed God, and love can go through every difficulty you can imagine, and love is still strong.

\v 4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
\v 5 or rude. It is not self-serving, it is not easily-angered, nor does it keep a count of wrongs.
\v 6 It does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth.
\v 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.
