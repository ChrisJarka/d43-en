===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Jesus continues to teach his disciples.)
    * **I came to cast fire upon the earth**  - "I came to throw fire on the earth" or "I came to set the earth on fire."  This is a metaphor for 1) division, 2) purification, or 3) judgment. 
    * **how I wish that it was already kindled** - This is an exclamation emphasizing how much he wished this. It can be translated as "I wish very much that it was already lit."
    * **But I have a baptism to be baptized with** - Baptism is used here as a metaphor for suffering. Just as a person can be completely covered over by water, they can be covered over by suffering. This can be translated as "I will be baptized with suffering" or as a simile: "I must be immersed in suffering as a person being baptized is immersed  in water." (See: [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor]])
    * **how I am distressed until it is completed!** - This is an exclamation emphasizing how distressed he was. It can be translated as "I am terribly distressed and will be so until this suffering is completed!"
    * **how I am distressed** - This exclamation emphasizes how distressed he was. It can be translated as “I am terribly distressed and will be so until this suffering is completed!” This is like a pregnant woman looking forward to childbirth not for the pain but for the final result.
