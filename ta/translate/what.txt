===== What is Translation? =====

The word "translation" is from the verb "to translate."

The verb "to translate" can mean any of the following:
  - to turn one language into another (French to Spanish, English to Swahili ...)
  - to explain in a way that is easier to understand (interpret)
  - to change something into another form (for example, words into actions)
  - to move from one place to another (transfer funds to a different account)

The first definition is the most common use of "to translate." When we take material from one language and put it into another language, we do not substitute random words. We must follow the basic principles, rules, and guidelines of translation.
