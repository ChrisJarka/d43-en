  * **You will only observe and see** - "You yourself will not suffer, but you will watch carefully, and you will see"
  * **the punishment of the wicked** - The abstract noun "punishment" can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "how God punishes the wicked" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **Yahweh is my refuge** - The writer speaks of Yahweh protecting him as if Yahweh were a safe place for him to find protection from his enemies. AT: "Yahweh protects me, like a person finds protection in a place of refuge" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Make the Most High your refuge also** - "You should make the Most High your refuge also." The psalmist stops speaking to God and speaks to the reader.
