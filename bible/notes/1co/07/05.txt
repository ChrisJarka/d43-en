<usfm>
\v 5 You may refuse \add to have sexual relations with\add* each other \f + \ft euphemism \f* only if you both first agree to do that for a short time, in order that you may both have more time to pray. Then after that, begin having sexual relations again \f + \ft euphemism \f* in order that Satan will not be able to persuade you \add to have sex with someone else\add* because you are unable to control your sexual desires.
\p
\v 6 I am telling you these things to say that \add God\add* allows \add you to get married, but he\add* does not say that you must \add get married\add*.
\v 7 I myself wish that all people would stay \add unmarried\f + \ft Or: single \f*\add*, as I am. But God has enabled each person to live in different ways. He has enabled some people to \add live without getting married\add*, and he has enabled other people to \add get married\add*.

\v 5 Do not deprive one another except it be by consent for a short while so that you may give yourselves to prayer. And may then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self control.
\v 6 But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.
\v 7 Yet I wish that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man has his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.
