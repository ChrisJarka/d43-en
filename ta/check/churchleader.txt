===== Church Leader Check =====

After the translation has been checked by community members for clarity, it will be checked by a group of church leaders for accuracy. This group must consist of at least three church leaders who are native speakers of the target language, and at least one of which understands well one of the languages in which the source text is available. They should not be related to, or otherwise closely connected with, the translator (or translation team). Usually these reviewers will be pastors of church congregations. These church leaders should represent the different churches in the language community. That is, they must not be from the same church network, but must be from three different church networks, if the community has that many.

These reviewers should follow these steps:

  - Read the [[:en:statement-of-faith|Statement of Faith ]]and [[:en:translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines ]]to make sure that the translation is in agreement with both of those as they review the translation.
  - Answer the questions about the translator or translation team that are located [[:en:ta:check:translatorqualifications|here]].
  - Verify that the translation communicates clearly and naturally by following the guidelines [[:en:ta:check:clear|here]].
  - Verify that the translation accurately communicates the meaning of the source text by following the guidelines [[:en:ta:check:accurate|here]].
  - Verify that the translation is complete by following the guidelines [[:en:ta:check:complete|here]].
  - After you have reviewed several chapters, or a whole book of the Bible if it is short, meet with the translation team and ask about each problem. Discuss with the translation team how they might adjust the translation in order to fix the problems. Make plans to meet again with the translation team at a later time, after they have had time to adjust the translation and test it with the community.
  - Meet again with the translation team to verify that they have fixed the problems.
  - Affirm that the translation is good. Click [[:en:ta:check:level2churchaffirmation|

  - Is the translation appropriate[[https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/checking/level2/appropriate|?]]

  - Are the words used [[https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/checking/level2/acceptable|acceptable? ]]

  - If there is a problem in the translation in any of the areas mentioned in sections 3 or 4, make a note of that.

[[:en:ta:check:4|[4]]] These are questions that will help determine whether or not the translation has been done in a style that is acceptable to the intended audience:

  - Is the translation written in a way that can be understood easily by both young and old members of the language community? (Whenever someone speaks, they can change their choice of words for either a younger or an older audience. Is this translation done using words that suit a wide variety of people?)
  - Is the style of this translation more formal or informal? (Is the manner of speaking appropriate for the local community?)

[[:en:ta:check:5|[5]]] These questions will help to determine if an appropriate alphabet has been chosen to represent the sounds of the language and words have been written in a consistent way so that the translation will be easy to read:

  - Is the alphabet suitable to represent the sounds of the language of the new translation? (Are there any sounds that make a difference in meaning but have to use the same symbol as another sound? Does this make the words hard to read? Can additional marks be used to adjust these letters and show the differences?)
  - Is the spelling used in the book consistent? (Are there rules that the writer should follow to show how words change in different situations? Can they be described so others will know how to read and write the language easily?)
  - Did the writer use an appropriate form of the language acceptable to the wider language community? (Is the writer familiar with the dialects of your language found throughout the area? Has the writer used expressions, phrases, connectors, and spellings that will be recognized by a broad section of the language community?)
