\v 26 And he said to him, Went not my heart with thee, when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a
time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive yards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and male servants and
maid-servants?
\v 27 The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave to thee, and to your seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a
leper as white as snow.
