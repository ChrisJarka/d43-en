===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to teach the crowd not to judge people.)
  * These verses are a metaphor that compares the things that a person thinks and does to things that a person stores carefully in a safe place. It could be translated without the figure of speech as in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **The good man from the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good**  - "The good man brings what is good out of the good treasure of his heart"
  * **The good man**  - "The good person." The word "good" here refers to moral goodness. The word "man" here refers to a person, male or female. Since it does not refer to a specific person, it could be translated as "A good person" or "Good people" (UDB).
  * **from the good treasure of his heart**  - "from among the good things he keeps in his heart" or "from what he values"
  * **brings out that which is good**  - "brings out good things" or "displays good things." This could be translated without the metaphor as "lives his life in a good way" or "does good things which show" (UDB).
  * **from the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks**  - "his mouth speaks from the things that his heart is full of" or "what he thinks in his heart affects what he says with his mouth" or "what he values in his heart determines what he says with his mouth." It could be translated without reference to the mouth and heart, as in "what a person says shows what he constantly thinks about" or "what he thinks about affects what he says."
