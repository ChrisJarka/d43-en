<usfm>
\v 7 And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when you entered, you
defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.
\v 8 The priests said not, Where is Jehovah? and they that handle the law knew me not: the rulers also transgressed against me,
and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.
