\v 12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had instructed when he said, "Come back to me on the third day."
\v 13 The king answered the people roughly and ignored the advice of the old men that they had given him.
\v 14 He spoke to them following the advice of the young men; he said, "My father burdened you with a heavy yoke, but I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **heavy yoke** - A heavy yoke is a metaphor for very difficult labor and requirements. AT: "treated us cruelly" or "forced us to work very hard" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:12:03|12:4]].
  * **My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions** - This metaphor means that the punishment Rehoboam plans to give will be worse than what his father gave. AT: "My father used whips to force you to work but I will use more cruel punishment." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:1ki:12:10|12:11]].
