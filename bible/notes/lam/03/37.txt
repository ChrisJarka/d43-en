<usfm>
\v 37 No one can \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* command something to happen \add and then cause it to happen\add*
\q2 if Yahweh has not already decided that it should happen.
\q1
\v 38 God in heaven \f + \ft metonymy \f* is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the one who causes disasters to happen,
\q2 and he also causes good things to happen.
\q1
\v 39 So it is certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* right for us, who are only humans, to complain
\q2 when he punishes us for the sins that we have committed.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord decreed it?** - The author uses this rhetorical question to teach that when someone commands something to happen, it will happen only if God has already decreed that it should happen. AT: "No one has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord decreed it." or "What someone has commanded to happen has never happened unless the Lord decreed it." (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **has spoken** - It can be expressed clearly that this refers to commanding something to happen. AT: "has commanded that something should happen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **and it came to pass** - "and what he said happened"
  * **Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and the good come?** - The author uses this rhetorical question to teach that both calamities and good things happen only because God has commanded them to happen. AT: "It is only from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and the good come." or "It is only because the Most High has commanded it that both calamities and good things happen." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **from the mouth of the Most High** - Here "mouth" represents what God says or commands. AT: "from the command of the Most High" or "because the Most High has commanded it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **both calamities and the good come** - Here "come" represents happening. AT: "Both calamities and pleasant things happen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **How can any person alive complain? How can a person complain about the punishment for his sins?** - The author uses these rhetorical questions to teach that people should not complain when God punishes them. AT: "A person who is alive should not complain when God punishes him for his sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **How can any person alive complain** - Possible meanings are 1) it is implied that people are merely people. AT: "How can a mere person complain" or 2) it is implied that being alive is a gift from God. AT: "How can a person who is blessed to be alive complain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
