\v 8 And now you think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude, and
there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.
\v 9 Have you not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner
of the peoples of other lands? so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams,
the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.
