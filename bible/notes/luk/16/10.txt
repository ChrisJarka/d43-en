\v 10 People who faithfully manage small matters will also faithfully manage important matters. People who are dishonest in the way they handle small matters will be dishonest in the way they handle important matters.
\v 11 So if you have not faithfully handled the money you have while here on earth,how can you be trusted to handle spiritual riches? that God has given you here on earth, he will certainly not allow you to possess true riches!
\v 12 And if you have not faithfully managed things that belong to other people, you will certainly not be given things of your own to manage!

\v 10 He who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much, and he who is unrighteous in very little is also unrighteous in much.
\v 11 Therefore, if you have not been faithful in using worldly wealth, who will trust you with true wealth?
\v 12 And if you have not been faithful in that which belongs to another person, who will give you that which is your own?
