===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Yahweh has said that he** - Solomon speaks to Yahweh as if he were speaking to someone else to show that he respects Yahweh. AT: "Yahweh, you have said that you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **in thick darkness** - Here the word "thick" shows that the darkness is extreme. Yahweh spoke of not allowing sinful people to see him as if he were to live in darkness. AT: "in great darkness" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I have built you a lofty residence** - Solomon speaks of commanding the people to build the temple and telling them how to do it as if he himself had built it. AT: "I and your people have built you a loft residence" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **a lofty residence** - a magnificent house, appropriate for someone who is very important
  * **while all the assembly of Israel was standing** - The phrase "all the assembly" is a generalization. It does not mean that every person of Israel was standing, but that all of the people who were gathered there were standing. AT: "while the people of Israel there were standing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
