\v 4 Then he said to me, "Son of man, go, travel to the house of Israel and speak my words to them.
\v 5 For you are not being sent to a people of a strange speech or a difficult language, but to the house of Israel--
\v 6 not to a mighty nation of strange speech or a difficult language whose words you could not understand! If I sent
you to them, they would listen to you!
\v 7 But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me. So all the house of Israel is stubborn-browed and hard-hearted.
