====== Mark 01 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 1:2-3, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "You can make me clean" ==
Leprosy was a disease of the skin and makes a person unclean and unable to properly worship God. Jesus is capable of making people physically clean or healthy as well as spiritually clean or right with God.


=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Past Events ==
Parts of this chapter are a narrative sequence of events that have already happen. Marks sometimes writes as if the events have already happened and at other times writes as if the events are still in progress. This can cause difficulty in translation by creating an illogical order of events. It may be necessary to make these consistent by writing as if all the events have already happened. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:mrk:01:04|1:4-5]])

== "The kingdom of God is near" ==

Scholars debate whether the “kingdom of God” was present at this time or still coming. English translations frequently use the phrase “at hand,” but this can create difficulty in translating. Other versions use the phase “is drawing near” and “has come near.”
