===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **sell your people for nothing**  - When Yahweh allows his people to be taken into slavery they compare it to being sold for no money. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **You make us a rebuke...a scoffing and a derision...** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize how much the people among whom they live mock them. See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * ** a scoffing and a derision** - The words "scoffing" and "derision" mean basically the same thing and emphasize how greatly people scoff at them. AT: "something that people make fun of" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]]) 
  * ** an insult among...a shaking of the head...** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize how much the people among whom they live insult them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
