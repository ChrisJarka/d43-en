\p
\v 1 A man of God came out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Bethel. Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.
\v 2 The man of God cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh and said, "O altar, altar, Yahweh says, 'Behold, a son will 
be born to the family of David, Josiah by name, and upon you will he sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn
incense upon you, and men’s bones they will  burn upon you.' "
\v 3 And the man of God gave a sign the same day, saying, "This is the sign which Yahweh has spoken, 'Look, the altar will be split apart, and the ashes upon it will be poured out."
