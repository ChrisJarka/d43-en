====== wine ======


===== Definition: =====


Wine is a kind of fermented drink made from the juice of a fruit called grapes, which grow on vines.


    * To make wine, grapes are crushed so that the juice comes out. Then the juice is left until it ferments and alcohol forms in it.
    * The wine in the Bible did not have as much alcohol in it as current wine does. Modern day wine has had alcohol added to it but the wine in the Bible was fermented without anything added to it.


This could be translated as, "fermented grape juice" or, "fermented drink made from a fruit called grapes."
