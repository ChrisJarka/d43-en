=== What is the Gospel of John about? ===

The Gospel of John is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ, but that focus especially on his work. The four Gospels emphasize different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. The author of this book says that he wrote it so "that people might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God" (20:30–31). 

John's Gospel is very different from the other three Gospels, because it focuses on the [[:en:obe:kt:sign|signs]] Jesus did to prove that what he said about himself was true.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "The Gospel of John" or "The Gospel according to John." Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, for example, "The Good News about Jesus that John wrote." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]])

=== Who wrote the Book of John? ===

The book does not give the reader the name of the author. Since early Christian times, however, it has generally been believed that the author was John, one of Jesus' disciples.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Why does John spend a great deal of time recording the final week of Jesus' life? ===

While the life of Jesus is important, his sacrificial death is of greatest importance to the Christian. His life provides an example for Christians to follow, but it also prepares Jesus to be a perfect sacrifice for sin. John's focus on the events immediately prior to Jesus's death emphasize that Jesus willingly died for the sins of man.

=== How many Gods are there in Christianity? ===

According to Scripture, there is only one God. John explains that this God exists as three persons: God the Father, Jesus (the Son) and the Holy Spirit. This can be difficult to understand and Christians often use theological terms like trinity or the triune God to refer to the existence of one God in three persons. John emphasizes to his reader that Jesus is the "Son of God", meaning that he is both fully God and fully man.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of John? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of more accurate manuscripts. The follow are the most significant issues in John:\\

  * "waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel of the Lord occasionally went down into the pool and stirred the water and whoever went first after the stirring of the water, was made well from the disease they had." (5:3-4) (so noted in ULB)
  * The story of the adulterous woman (7:53–8:11) (so noted in ULB)
  * "going through the midst of them, and so passed by" (8:59)


Translators are advised not to translate these passages. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region that have some of these verses, it is not wrong to translate them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to John's Gospel.
