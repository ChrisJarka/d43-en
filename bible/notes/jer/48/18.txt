\v 18 Come down from your honored place and sit on the dry ground, you daughter living in Dibon.
\q For the one who will destroy Moab is attacking you, 
\q the one who will destroy your strongholds.
\q
\v 19 Stand on the road and watch, you people who live in Aroer.
\q Ask the ones who are fleeing and escaping. Say, 'What has happened?'

\q Howl and lament; shout for help.
\q Tell it to people by the Arnon River that Moab has been devastated.
