\v 4 What can I do with you, O Ephraim?
\q2 and what can I do with you, O Judah?
\q1 Your love for me is like the morning cloud, it soon vanishes, 
\q2 and your love is like the dew that quickly vanishes when the sun shines on it.
\q1
\v 5 I send my prophets to you, 
\q2 and it was as though they cut you into pieces when they gave you their messages, 
\q1 so devastated were you by what they said. 
\q2 And I slaughtered you with the words I spoke to youâ€” 
\q1 speaking judgment against you 
\q2 and showing you my anger in the message I gave the prophets.
\q1 My justice will come like the flashes of lightning, 
\q2 quickly showing you your sins and making my judgment known to you.

\v 4 O Ephraim, what will I do with you?
\q O Judah, what will I do with you?
\q Your goodness is like a morning cloud,
\q and like the dew that goes away early.
\q
\v 5 Therefore I have cut them to pieces with the prophets,
\q I have slain them with the words of my mouth,
\q and your decrees are like the light that goes forth.
