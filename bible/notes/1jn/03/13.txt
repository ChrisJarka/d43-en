<usfm> \v 13 You should not be amazed when unbelievers hate you. \v 14 We know that God has made us to live forever with him, because we love our fellow believers. But God regards anyone who does not love them as dead. \v 15 Those who hate any of their fellow believers, God considers them to be murderers. And you know that no murderer has eternal life. </usfm>
