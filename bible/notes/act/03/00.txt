====== Acts 03 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Abrahamic Covenant ==
This chapter explains that part of the Abrahamic covenant has been fulfilled in Jesus.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "You delivered up" ==
There are many references to the "men of Israel" as "you." While it is true that the leaders of Israel were responsible for these events, ultimately it was Jesus' choice to be delivered up and the need for his death was the [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]] of mankind. Therefore, the author is not bringing [[:en:obe:kt:judge|judgment]] upon these people, but is urging [[:en:obe:kt:repent|repentance]] for their [[:en:obe:kt:condemn|condemnation]] of Jesus.
