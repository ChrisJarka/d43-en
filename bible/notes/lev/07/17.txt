\v 17 But any meat that is left until the third day must be completely burned.
\v 18 If any meat from the offering to maintain fellowship with Yahweh is eaten on the third day, Yahweh will not accept that offering; it will be useless to offer it, because Yahweh will consider that it is worthless. Anyone who eats some of it will have to pay a penalty \add to Yahweh\add*.

\v 17 but that which remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
\v 18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him that offers it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity.
