===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **like briers and thorns**- See how you translated "thorns and briers" in 5:6.
  * **unless they grasp my protection and make peace with me; let them make peace with me**- Yahweh will not completely destroy Israel's enemies if they turn from their evil ways and "make peace" with him. Here this means for the people to have a good relationship with him. This is repeated for emphasis. (See: Doublet)
