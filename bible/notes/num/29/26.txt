\v 26 On the fifth day of the festival, you must bring to the altar nine  young bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs that are one year-old. These animals must have no defects. They must all be burned on the altar, and their smell will please me.
\v 27 Bring also with the animals the offerings of flour and wine that are required.
\v 28 Also offer one male goat to be sacrificed to remove the guilt of your sins. These animals will be in addition to the offerings of animals and flour and wine that are completely burned on the altar each day.
