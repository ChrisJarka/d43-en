====== know that I am Yahweh ======

===== Description =====

"You will know that I am Yahweh" and "They will know that I am Yahweh" occur many times in the Old Testament. It is not simply that people will know that God's name is Yahweh, but they will know something about his character.

When writing the note, replace "[UDB text]" with the content of the UDB text that tells what God says about himself. 

This note is given as a suggestion to help you. You may find that you need to write it differently.
