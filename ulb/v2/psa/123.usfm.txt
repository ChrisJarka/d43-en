\c 123
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q
\v 1 To you do I lift up mine eyes,
\q O you that sit in the heavens.
\q
\v 2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,
\q As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress;
\q So our eyes look to Jehovah our God,
\q Until he have mercy upon us.
\q
\v 3 Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah, have mercy upon us;
\q For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
\q
\v 4 Our soul is exceedingly filled
\q With the scoffing of those that are at ease,
\q And with the contempt of the proud.
