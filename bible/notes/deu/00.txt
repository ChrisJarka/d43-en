**What is Deuteronomy about?**\\

The name “Deuteronomy” is taken from the Greek language and means “Second Law” because this is the second time Moses was giving the law. (Covenant renewal) He wrote this book to remind the Israelites of what God had done for them and what he expected from them. He repeated the “Ten Words” (“The Ten Commandments”) he had given the people at Sinai, and warned them against idolatry and the danger of falling away from their faith in Yahweh. He promised Yahweh’s judgment on those who disobeyed, and Yahweh’s blessings on those who obey his Law. 

Deuteronomy is quoted directly or reflected in the New Testament over 80 times. It must be noted that there also is remarkable prophecy in this book that should not be overlooked. Deuteronomy 28:49 can be read as a prophecy, giving great authenticity to the account as a whole. The great theme is that God rescued his people and gave them his Law to obey.

**Who wrote Deuteronomy?**\\

The Bible tells us that Moses composed the book of Numbers. The writers of both the Old and New Testament confirm his part in the composition of the book of Numbers. However, it is widely assumed that Chapter 34 and the matters dealing with Moses’ death or events occurring after Moses’ death were compiled or written by Joshua.

**What are the different parts of Deuteronomy?**\\ 

In the first four chapters Moses encourages the Israelites to obey the laws of God after reminding them of the Exodus and their journey of the wilderness. 

From chapter 5 through 28, Moses repeats the Ten Commandments to the Israelites and gives details about the meaning of the law and the importance of obeying the law, as well as putting God first as his chosen people. He promised Yahweh’s blessings on those who obey and his judgment on those who disobey. 

In the last chapters, Moses blesses the tribes of Israel and appoints Joshua as his successor. Before he dies, God also shows him the promise land, although he is not allowed to enter it.
