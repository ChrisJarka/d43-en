====== will of God ======

===== Definition: =====

Text

  * The will of God refers to God's desires and plans mostly relating to his interaction with people and how he wants people to respond to Him.  It also refers to his plans or desires for creation.  Romans 12:2 refers to God's "good, perfect and pleasing will" which in the Greek construction refers to one will, not different levels of God's will, such as we might say: I have a good, perfect and pleasing goat, referring to one goat.
