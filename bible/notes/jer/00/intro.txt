===What is Jeremiah about?===

The book of Jeremiah begins at about 626 BC. After the death of Josiah, Jeremiah was opposed by many groups with Israel (some were aligned with Egypt, and also there were the idol worshipers who hated him for denouncing their gods. During the reign of King Jehoiakim, Jeremiah proclaimed his prophecies about “The Temple of Yahweh.” King Jehoiakim received one of these prophecies and burned it. The next king, King Zedekiah, imprisoned Jeremiah because he called for the king to surrender to Babylon. When Nebuchadnezzar (of Babylonia) conquered (beginning at 597 BC and finally conquering Israel in 587 BC), Jeremiah was offered housing and a pension when (and if) he came to Babylon. But Jeremiah remained in Jerusalem to help the few Jews that remained there. Soon, Gedaliah (the governor of Judah for the Babylonians) was murdered, and Jeremiah was captured by some Jewish rebels, and taken to Egypt. Those rebels chose Egypt for refuge rather than to live under the tyranny of Nebuchadnezzar in Babylonia. Jeremiah may have died soon after being taken to Egypt, but not before he prophesied the Babylonian campaign against Egypt.

===How should the title of this book be translated?=== 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Jeremiah" may also be called the "The book about Jeremiah" or "The sayings of Jeremiah."

===Who wrote Jeremiah?===

The book of Jeremiah was likely written by Jeremiah, son of Hilkah. He was a priest and a prophet from Judah. This was not the first edition of the book. The original writing was burned by Jehoiakim. A man named Baruch helped Jeremiah in physically writing the letter.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
===What is the New Covenant?===
Jeremiah 31 introduces a new covenant between Yahweh and Israel. It is promised that the law would be written on the hearts of men who would have a new heart. There would also be many other things.


===Would God give Judah victory because the temple was his dwelling place?===

As a nation, the people of Judah felt indestructible because the presence of Yahweh was with them in the temple. They assumed that they could not be conquered because of this. 

===Is God only concerned about Israel?===
While much of the Old Testament prior to this time is concerned with the nation of Israel, Jeremiah begins to focus on God's judgment on the other nations of the world. Judgment must come upon the nations because of their sin.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

===How do I translate Jeremiah's illustrations?===

Jeremiah frequently uses illustrations or symbols to explain a lesson. These illustrations are meant to be easy to understand and have a great impact on the reader, typically bringing them to repentance. In 27:1-15, Jeremiah wore a yoke around his neck to illustrate that Nebuchadnezzar would have a yoke put around his neck. It may be helpful to see these illustrations function as a type of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|metaphor]].

===Is Jeremiah arranged in chronological order?===

No, Jeremiah has many instances where it is clearly out of chronological order. It appears instead that it is arranged by topic.
