====== Parables ======

The word parable in Greek (and its Hebrew counterpart) has a fairly broad meaning. Concepts translated as "parable" include narrative stories, metaphors, similes, proverbs and even riddles. In the broadest sense, parables are a "general term for figurative sayings." When you encounter a parable, know that the intent is to convey meaning through a story or word picture.

A parable is not an actual account of an event; it is more like a hypothetical situation (e.g. This could happen…) or it is an earthly reality meant to broaden understanding of eternal truths (e.g. Kingdom parables).

The [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor]] and [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile]] pages may help in understanding the concept of parables; however, the translation tips are specific for those situations.

The power of a Parable is that it can touch a heart with conviction in a way that a pointed, direct teaching may be unable to do. A parable allows the reader to experience a truth in a non-threatening way. The lesson comes in a story a reader understands and can feel themselves being a part of, and the meaning of the story has the opportunity to settle into their heart.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Luke 4:23 //Jesus said to them, "Certainly you will say this proverb to me, 'Doctor, heal yourself. Whatever we heard that you did in Capernaum, do it here in your hometown too.'" ULB//


Luke 5:36 36 //Then Jesus also spoke a parable to them. "No man tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to mend an old garment. If he did that, he would tear the new garment, and the piece of cloth from the new garment would not fit with the cloth of the old garment. ULB//

Luke 6:39 //Then he also told them a parable. "Can a blind person guide another blind person? If he did, they would both fall into a pit, would they not?//
 
The following passage seems to be a combination of a parable and simile. Jesus actually used the words ”compare” and ”like” so it seems to be a simile. But the translation suggestions on the [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile]] page would not be appropriate here.

Luke 7:31,32
//'To what then should I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like? They are like children playing in the marketplace, who sit and call to one another and say, "We played a flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned, and you did not weep."'//



===== Translation Suggestions =====
Do __not__ try to explain the story or what Jesus was teaching, but simply translate the parable. Your language may have a way of communicating that a narrative is a story (or even a story whose purpose is to teach something) and not an account of a historical event.

Parable are best translated as a situation that can be understood within your own culture. The culture of the Biblical writer impacts any parable, so full understanding of the parable prior to translation is necessary to accurately convey the message of a parable.

Parables seldom (if ever) contain the names of specific individuals (That may be a key for you in identifying what is a parable vs what is a narrative account.)
