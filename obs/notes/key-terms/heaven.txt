====== heaven, sky ======


==== (heaven, sky, heavenly) ====

===== Definition: =====

The word "heaven" in the Bible can have two different meanings: "heaven" or "sky." It also has a figurative use as a reference to God.

  * When it is translated as "heaven," this refers to the place where God lives.
  * When it is translated as "sky," this is the blue expanse above the earth that has clouds and the air we breathe.
  * In some contexts, the word "heaven" could refer to either the sky or the place where God lives.
  * The term "heavens" refers to everything we see above the earth, including the sun, moon, and stars.
  * When "heaven" is used figuratively, it is a way of referring to God. So for example, the "kingdom of heaven" really means the "kingdom of God."
