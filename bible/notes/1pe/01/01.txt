\v 1 I, Peter, who have been appointed by Jesus Christ to be an apostle, am writing this letter to you believers whom God has chosen to belong to him. You are living in the Roman provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. Just like the Jews who lived in Israel long ago were scattered to other countries far from their homes, you now live far from heaven, which is your true home.
\v 2 God our Father chose you according to what he himself decided previously, and his Spirit has set you apart in order that you would obey Jesus Christ, and in order that just like Moses sprinkled the Israelites with blood when God established the old covenant, Jesus would establish his new covenant with you with the blood that flowed from his body when he died. May God act very kindly to you, and may he give you much inner peace.
