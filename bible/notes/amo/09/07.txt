===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Are you not like the people of Ethiopia to me, people of Israel?** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that the people of Israel are no more special to him than the people of Ethiopia. AT: "You people of Israel, you are certainly now no more important to me than the people of Ethiopia." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate these words as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:02:11|2:11]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Did I not bring up Israel out of the land of Egypt, the Philistines from Crete, and the Arameans from Kir?** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that the people of Israel are no more special than the Philistines or the Arameans. AT: "Yes, I brought the people of Israel from the land of Egypt, but I also brought the Philistines from Crete and the Arameans from Kir." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Kir** - See how you translated the name of this region in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:01:05|1:5]].
  * **the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom** - Here "eyes" represents seeing. Also, Yahweh speaks of himself in third person. AT: "I, the Lord Yahweh, see that the people of this kingdom are very sinful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **I will destroy it from the face of the earth** - The idiom "from the face of the earth" means "completely." AT: "I will completely destroy this kingdom" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the house of Jacob** - Here "house" represents a family. And, "Jacob" represents his descendants. AT: "the descendants of Jacob" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
