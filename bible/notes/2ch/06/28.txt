\v 28 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there be;
\v 29 what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house:
\v 30 then hear you from heaven your dwelling-place, and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know (for you, even you only, know the hearts of the children of men);
\v 31 that they may fear thee, to walk in your ways, so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.
