====== A Sweet Aroma ======

===== Definition: =====

"A sweet aroma" is a metaphor that is used a lot in the pentateuch. It may show up in different ways, but the note below will give you ideas of how to write about it. When the metaphor is explained, is it good to keep "aroma/smell" in the translation?


===== Standard Notes: =====

  * **It will produce a sweet aroma pleasing to the Lord** - The Lord being pleased with the sincere worshiper who offered the sacrifice is spoken of as if God were pleased with the aroma of the sacrifice. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

The following show how I've applied the explanation of the metaphor to some ATs. What do you think?
