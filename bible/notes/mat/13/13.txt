\v 13 That is why I use parables when I speak to people, because although they see \add what I do\add*, they do not perceive \add what it means\add*, and although they hear \add what I say\add*, they do not really understand \add what it means\add*.
\v 14 What these people do completely fulfills what \add God told\add* the prophet Isaiah \add to say long ago to the people who did not\add* try to understand what he said,
\p You will hear \add what I say\add*, but you will not understand it. You will keep seeing \add what I do\add*, but you will not understand \add what it means\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*.

\v 13 Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they
understand.
\v 14 And to them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith,
\q By hearing you shall hear, and shall in no wise understand;
\q And seeing you shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:
