===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It came about** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here. AT: "It happened that."
  * **the window of the ark which he had made** - The phrase "which he had made" tells about the "window." Some languages may need to make this phrase a separate sentence: "Noah had made a window in the boat. It came about after forty days that he opened the window." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_distinguish]])
  * **raven** - a bird with black feathers that mainly eats the flesh of dead animals that it finds
  * **it flew back and forth** - This means that the raven kept leaving the boat and returning.
  * **until the water was dried up** - This could be translated as an active clause: "until the wind dried up the water" or "until the water dried up." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
