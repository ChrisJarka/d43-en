\v 5 O Yahweh, my God, you have done many wonderful things!
\q2 No one can list all the wonderful things that you have planned for us.
\q1 If I tried to tell \add others\add* about all those wonderful things,
\q1 I would not be able to,
\q2 because there would be too many for me to mention.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Various kinds of sacrifices and other offerings are not the \add only\add* things that delight you.
\q2 You have enabled me to understand that very well [IDI].
\q1 \add Animals\add* burned \add on the altar\add* and other offerings
\q2 are not all that you require \add for sins to be forgiven\add*.

<usfm>
\q
\v 5 Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful works which you have done,
\q And your thoughts which are to us-ward:
\q They cannot be set in order to thee;
\q If I would declare and speak of them,
\q They are more than can be numbered.
\q
\v 6 Sacrifice and offering you have no delight in;
\q Mine ears have you opened:
\q Burnt-offering and sin-offering have you not required.
</usfm>
