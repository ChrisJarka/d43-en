In discourse, the end of the story can be used to give several different types of information. This information is different from the actions that make up the main part of the story. A book of the Bible is often made up of many smaller stories that are part of the larger story of the book itself.

===Different types of end of story information:===

  * To summarize the story.
  * To give a comment about what happened in the story.
  * To connect a smaller story to the larger story it is a part of.
  * To tell the reader what happens to a specific character after the main part of the story ends.
  * To tell on-going action that continues after the main part of the story ends.
