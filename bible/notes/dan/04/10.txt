\v 10 This is what I dreamed while I was lying on my bed: I saw a large tree \add growing\add* in the middle of the land.
\v 11 The tree was very strong and had grown very tall; \add it seemed that\add* its top reached up to the sky, with the result that everyone in the world \f + \ft hyperbole \f* could see it.
\v 12 It had beautiful leaves, and it had produced a lot of fruit for people to eat. Wild animals rested in the shade of that tree, and birds built nests in its branches. All the living creatures everywhere in the world got food from that tree.

\v 10 Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and the height
thereof was great.
\v 11 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached to heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the
earth.
\v 12 The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow
under it, and the birds of the heavens lived in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed from it.
