\v 12 Even though the Lord opened many ways for us to share the Good News with the city of Troas,
\v 13 But I was worried about my brother Titus, because I did not find him there. And so I left Troas and returned to Macedonia to look for him.

\v 12 Though a door was opened to me by the Lord when I came to the city of Troas to  preach the gospel of Christ there, 
\v 13 I had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I left them and returned to Macedonia.
