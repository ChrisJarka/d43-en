<usfm>
\v 10 I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have
carried away your horses; and I have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your nostrils: yout have you not returned
to me, says Jehovah.
\v 11 I have overthrown cities among you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a brand plucked
out of the burning: yout have you not returned to me, says Jehovah.
