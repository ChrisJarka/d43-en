\c 120
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q
\v 1 In my distress I cried to Jehovah,
\q And he answered me.
\q
\v 2 Deliver my soul, O Jehovah, from lying lips,
\q And from a deceitful tongue.
\q
\v 3 What shall be given to thee, and what shall be done more to thee,
\q You deceitful tongue?
\q
\v 4 Sharp arrows of the mighty,
\q With coals of juniper.
\q
\v 5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech,
\q That I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
\q
\v 6 My soul has long had her dwelling
\q With him that hates peace.
\q
\v 7 I am for peace:
\q But when I speak, they are for war.
