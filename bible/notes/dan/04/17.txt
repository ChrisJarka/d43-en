\v 17 The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living
may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whoever he will, and sets up over it the
lowest of men.
\v 18 This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the
wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able; for the spirit of the holy
gods is in thee.
