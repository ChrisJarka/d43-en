\v 27 I saw what looked like glowing metal with the appearance of fire in it around him from his hips upward; from his hips downward I saw what looked like fire and brightness surrounding him!
\v 28 It looked like a rainbow that appears in the clouds on a rainy day—it looked like bright light surrounding him! This appeared as the likeness of the glory of Yahweh! When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice speaking!

===== Translation Notes: =====

Ezekiel continues to  describe the vision.

  * **with the appearance of fire in** - "that looked like it had fire in it"
  * **around him **- "all around the person sitting on the throne"
  * **from his hips upward** - Every part of the person's body that was above the hips looked like the glowing metal that looked like it had fire in it.
  * **from his hips downward I saw what looked like fire and brightness surrounding him** - This can be translated as a new sentence, "All around the person's body below the hips, I saw what looked like fire and a bright light."
  * **It looked like a rainbow that appears in the clouds on a rainy day-it looked like bright light surrounding him** - This can be translated as "The bright light that was all around the person looked like a rainbow that appears in the clouds on a day when it rains."
  * **rainbow** - a rainbow is a colorful strip of light that appears in the sky when it rains 
  * **This appeared as the likeness of the glory of Yahweh** - This can be translated as: "The bright light looked like something that was similar to the glory of Yahweh."
  * **When I saw it** - It is implied that talking about seeing the vision of Yahweh. Alternate translation: "When I saw the vision of Yahweh" or "When I saw Yahweh in the vision." (See:[[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **I fell upon my face** - "I bowed down to the ground" or "I lay on the ground." Ezekiel did not fall by accident. He went down to the ground to show that he respected and feared Yahweh.
  * **and I heard a voice speaking** – When Ezekiel says that he heard a voice speaking, he means that he hear someone speaking. Alternate translation: "I heard someone speaking." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
