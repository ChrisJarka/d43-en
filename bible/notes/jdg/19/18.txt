\v 18 And he said to him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah to the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from
thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am now going to the house of Jehovah; and there is no man that
takes me into his house.
\v 19 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid, and
for the young man that is with your servants: there is no lack of anything.
