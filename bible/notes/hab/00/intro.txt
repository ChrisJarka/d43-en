=== What is the Book of Habakkuk about? ===

While many other [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophets]] complained about Israel's sin and failure to obey the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Yahweh]], Habakkuk accuses Yahweh by asking him questions about the things he does. Habakkuk says the Babylonians are more [[:en:obe:kt:evil|evil]] and are more deserving of Yahweh’s punishment. Overall, Habakkuk seems to have in mind the rich people in Judah who mistreated the poor, as well as the evil religious leaders. Because of this fact, the idea that Yahweh acts with [[:en:obe:kt:justice|justice]] is important in the Book of Habakkuk.


=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may decided to translate this traditional title "The book of Habakkuk" in a way that is more clear to the readers. They may decide to call it, "The sayings of Habakkuk." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]).

=== Who wrote the Book of Habakkuk? ===

Nothing is known about Habakkuk, from whom these message came. The Chaldean empire, mentioned in several places in Habakkuk, helps us to date Habakkuk's life. The Chaldean empire had power from about 720 to 538 BC. It is probable that Habakkuk worked about the time of Jeremiah, Zephaniah, and Nahum during the reigns of Kings Josiah, Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim in Judah.


===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== Why did God use an evil nation to punish Judah? ===

Habakkuk seeks to address this issue. He explains that a person should obey Yahweh and should live a [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteous]] life. He says that evil must be punished, but that God determines the timing of the punishment.


===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How should the translator identify who is speaking? ===

It should be noted that Habakkuk often speaks to Yahweh, and Yahweh replies to him. The translator should be careful to identify the speaker (Habakkuk, or Yahweh) in each section. The translator may wish to make the speaker explicit, even though the original text does not always do this. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])


=== What style of writing is the Book of Habakkuk? ===

While much of the book of Habakkuk is prophecy, the third chapter is a psalm, that is, a song addressed to Yahweh. This chapter contains information about how to sing this psalm. It is possible that Habakkuk was a priest and was particularly interested in how the priests and Levites worshiped in the temple. 

=== Does Habakkuk question or challenge God? ===

There are times when Habakkuk speaks directly to God which may be taken as challenging or questioning God. Habakkuk is not intending to question Yahweh's authority. Instead, he is saying that he does not understand what Yahweh is doing." In some cultures, it may be improper to speak to an authority in this way. It may be necessary to rephrase Habakkuk's  questions in order to emphasize his sincere desire to understand God.
