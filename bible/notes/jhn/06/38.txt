<usfm>
\v 38 When I came down from heaven, it was not to do what I want. Instead, I came to do what \add God\f + \ft Or: my Father\add* \f*, who sent me, wants.
\v 39 What the one who sent me wants is that I keep forever all\f + \ft Or: never lose any \f* \f + \ft litotes \f* of those whom he has entrusted to me. He wants me to cause all of them to become alive again on the last day\f + \ft Or: on the day \add when I judge everyone\add* \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 40 \add Long ago in the desolate area when those who were bitten by snakes looked at the bronze replica of a snake, they were healed\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. What my Father wants is that \add similarly\add* everyone who looks at \add what\add* I \add have done\add* and believes in me will have eternal life. I will cause them to become alive again on the last day\f + \ft Or: on the day \add when I judge everyone\add* \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*."

\v 38 I came down from heaven not to do what I want, but to do the will of him who sent me.
\v 39 This is the will of him who sent me, that I lose none of those he has given me, and I raise all of them up on the last day.
\v 40 For the will of my Father is this: That everyone who looks in faith on the Son and who trust in him, will have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day."
