====== knew, have relations with, lay with, sleep with ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, these terms are euphemisms that refer to having sexual intercourse. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:euphemism|Euphemism]]) 

  * In Genesis it says that Adam "knew" Eve and she conceived children. This expression is used for a husband with his wife. Some English versions translate this with the expression "made love to" or "was intimate with."
  * For references to sexual relations outside of marriage, the expression "lay with" or "sleep with" is often used.
  * A translation may use different expressions in different contexts, depending on whether it is talking about a husband and wife or whether it is talking about some other relationship.<font 14px line-height: 19.600000381469727px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit></font> So it is important to make sure that the translation of this term has the correct meaning in each context.
