\v 23 I \add also have something to say to\add* you \add people who live in\add* Capernaum \add city\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Do not \add think that\add* you will be honored \f + \ft Or:that\add God\add* will honor you \f* in heaven!\f + \ft Or: Do you think that you will be honored \f + \ft Or:that\add God\add* will honor you \f* in heaven? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add That will not happen! On the contrary\add*, \add after you die, you will be sent\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will send you \f* down into the place where \add sinful people\add* will be punished \f + \ft Or:he will punish sinful people \f* \add forever\add*! \add God destroyed the ancient city of\add* Sodom \add because the people who lived in that city were extremely wicked\add*. If I had performed in \add Sodom the miracles that I performed in your city, the people there would have turned away from their wicked behavior and\add* their \add city\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* would still exist now \f + \ft metonymy \f*. But you, \add although I did miracles in your city, did not turn from your wicked behavior\add*.
\v 24 So note this: \add God\add* will punish \add the people who lived in\add* Sodom \add city\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, but he will punish you \add even\add* more severely on the final day when \add he\add* judges \add all people\add*."

\v 23 I also have something to say to you people who live in the city of Capernaum. Do you think that others will praise you so much that you will go right up to heaven? That will not happen! On the
contrary, you will go down to where God punishes people after they die! 
If I had done these same miracles in Sodom of long ago, those wicked people would certainly have stopped sinning, and their city would have been here even today. But you have not stopped sinning.
\v 24 Let me tell you this: God will punish the wicked people who lived in Sodom, but he will punish you even more severely on the final day when he judges all people."

\v 23 And you, Capernaum, do you wish to be exalted to heaven? You will go down to hades; for if in Sodom there had been done the great deeds that were done in you, it would still have remained until today.
\v 24 But I say to you that it shall be easier for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you."
