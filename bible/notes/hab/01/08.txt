\v 8 Their horses also are swifter than leopards, quicker than the evening wolves! So their horsemen charge forth, for their horsemen come from a great distance--
they fly as an eagle hurrying to eat!
\v 9 They will fill up with violence, for their faces eagerly go forward and they gather captives like sand!
