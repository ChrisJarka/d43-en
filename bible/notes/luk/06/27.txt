===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **love your enemies**- This can also be rendered "care about your enemies." It does not mean to have affection for your enemies, or to be sexually attracted to your enemies. The word in the language of origin here refers to putting the other person's interests before your own and caring about what happens to them regardless of how they make you feel.
    * **bless those who curse**  - "Bless" here does not mean "to be happy with", but rather "to speak well of."
