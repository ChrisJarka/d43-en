===== Sentence Types =====

//This answers the question:// //What are the different types of sentences?//
==== Description ====

A **sentence** is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. The basic types of sentences are:

   * **Statement**  - These are usually used to give information. '//This is a fact.//'
  * **Question**  - These are usually used to ask for information. '//Do you know him?//'
  * **Exclamation**  - These are usually used to express a strong feeling. 'Ouch, that hurt!'
  * **Command**  - These are usually used to make something happen. '//Pick that up.//'
**Reasons this is a translation Issue**

  * In some languages some of these sentence types can be used for some of the purposes of the other types. For example, in some languages questions can also be used as a statement or an exclamation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * Languages have different ways of showing that a statement is an exclamation.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

**Exclamations**

The word "Oh" is often used at the beginning of an exclamation.
>Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

Exclamations often are not full sentences with a subject and predicate. The exclamation below has only nouns and prepositions, but no verb.

>__O__ foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! (Luke 24:25 ULB)

Exclamations in English often have a question word such as "how" or "why"?

>__How__ unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

**Commands**

Commands are usually spoken to the person  or people that are expected to follow the command. Even though a speaker would call the person he is speaking to "you," many languages do not normally use the pronoun "you" in a command.

>I say to this one, '__Go__,' and he goes, and to another one, '__Come__,' and he comes, and to my servant, '__Do this__,' and he does it." (Matthew 8:9 ULB)

However, sometimes the pronoun "you" and even a noun that clarifies who is being spoken to is included. In the example below, the ULB has "you people" to clarify that the king wanted the group of servants to do this.  [[This shouldn't be necessary, since the quote margin has "his servants" as the addressee. Look for a better example -- especially one that has the pronoun in Hebrew or Greek.]]

>The king of Israel said to some servants, "__You people seize__ Micaiah and take him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, my son. 2 Chronicles 18:25

Some commands are not spoken to the person or thing that is commanded to do something. In English these commands often have "let." or "may"

>Whoever sends his wife away,__ let him give__ her a certificate of divorce. (Matthew 5:31 ULB)

Jesus said to the centurion, "Depart! As you have believed, so __may it be done__ for you." And the servant was healed at that very hour. (Matthew 8:13 ULB)
