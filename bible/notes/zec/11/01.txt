===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 You people of Lebanon must open your gates and allow the fire to burn your cedar trees!
\v 2 Your cypress trees must be like people who are wailing, because enemies have cut down the cedar trees. Those glorious trees are all gone. The oak trees in the region of Bashan should also be like people who are wailing, because enemies have cut down the oak trees in the dense forest.
\v 3 And listen to the shepherds crying because the fertile pastures have been ruined.
Listen to the lions roar; they roar because the thick forest where they live near the Jordan River has been ruined.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Open your doors, Lebanon, that fire may devour** - Not resisting what is about to happen is spoken of as if Lebanon were opening its doors. Here "Lebanon" is a metonym that represents the people of Lebanon. AT: "People of Lebanon, get ready, because fire will devour" or "People of Lebanon, do not try to stop the fire that will devour" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **fire may devour your cedars** - Fire completely burning up the cedars is spoken of as if the fire would devour the cedars. AT: "fire may completely destroy your cedars" or "fire may completely burn up your cedars" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Lament, cypress trees, for the cedar trees have fallen** - Cypress trees are spoken of as if they could grieve like a human. AT: "If the trees were people, they would cry out in sorrow. The cypress trees stand alone because the cedars have burned and fallen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **What was majestic has been devastated** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The majestic cedar trees are no more" or "The cedar trees were once majestic, but now they are ruined" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Lament, you oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest has gone down.** - The oaks of Bash are spoken of as if they could grieve like a human. AT: "If the oak trees in Bashan were people, they would wail, for their thick forests are gone" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **The shepherds howl** - "The shepherds cry out loudly"
  * **for their glory has been destroyed** - Here "their glory" probably represents the rich pastures that the shepherds led their sheep to. AT: "for their rich pastures are ruined" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **for the pride of the Jordan River** - Here "the pride" probably represents the forests that grew near the Jordan River. AT: "because the trees and shrubbery where they lived by the Jordan River are ruined" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
