\v 15 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so
returned.
\v 16 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor
to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
