    * "To sin" can be translated as "to disobey God" or "to do wrong."
    * Sin includes any action that does not reflect the nature and character of God.
    * Sin also includes any thought or idea that is not pleasing to God, whether we act on it or not.
    * Sinful refers to being marked or filled with wickedness.
    * "Sinful" can also be translated as "wicked", "immoral", "evil actions or behavior".
    * A "Sinner" is a person who is living according to their sinful human nature.


Adam and Eve sinned by eating the fruit that God told them not to eat. Prior to that act there was no sin in the world. Sin is passed from parent to child through the entire human race. God must punish sin.
