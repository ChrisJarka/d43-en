\v 13 And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal’s well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of
Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.
\v 14 Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king’s pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to
pass.
