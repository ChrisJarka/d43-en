===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Man**  - literally, "human being" or "person".
    * **your sins are forgiven you**  -this is literally, "your sins are released to you." In context, an active way of saying it is, "I forgive your sins" or "I release your sins", but this takes away from the intentional ambiguity as to who is doing the forgiveness implied by the original passive wording.
    * **Sins**-Sin means “missing the mark” as would a bullet miss its' target</font>
    * **forgiven**-That is, "have been forgiven"
    * question-Or, "debate among themselves"
    * **bold words**  - explanation
