**What is Song of Solomon about?**\\

Song of Solomon is a love song written by Solomon for his Shulamite bride. It shows the beauty of marriage as God intended it, between a husband and wife. Although Solomon had many wives, this books shows that this was not God's ideal for man and it was not a representation of true love. Although imperfect, in many ways Solomon's love for his wife is a representation of the type of love Jesus has for his church. 

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\ 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Song of Solomon is also called the "Songs of Love," "Great poems of love" or "The love songs of Solomon."

**Who wrote Song of Solomon?**\\
Although there are different ways of understanding the opening verse of the book, it is likely that Solomon is the author of Song of Solomon.

**Is the Song of Solomon about a man's love for his wife or something else?**\\
It is a song of love and adoration, but a few hundred years ago the Song of Songs was read as a song of love of the redeemer for his church. Most believe that the Song of Songs is a literal account of marriage and marital love. There are other suggestions, but the conclusion may be that the Song of Song is an expression of human love, the words of spoken love and adoration are instructive and there is a moral purpose. There is an expression of true love for each other, but it also reminds us, but is not limited to the picture in the New Testament of the love of Christ which sees the church as his bride and is most deeply loved. 

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
**How does Song of Solomon view human sexuality?**\\

In the ancient Near East, there was a great amount of sexual perversion. The book views human sexuality as a gift from God to be exercised within the bounds of marriage. Sex is not dirty, sinful or unclean, rather is intended as an expression of love between a husband and wife. Rather than give a proscriptive set of rules governing human sexuality, the Song of Solomon gives a description of godly sexuality within the confines of marriage.

**Does this book have religious significance?**\\

Song of Solomon does not mention God and it is likely about a physical relationship between a husband and a wife, but this does not mean it is without religious significance. 

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**How many characters are in Song of Solomon?**\\

One problem that has been faced by translators is the question of whether there are two characters (Solomon and the Shulamite bride) or is there a third character, the shepherd boy. If so, there would be a conflict between the love of the Shulamite for the shepherd boy and the love which Solomon has for the Shulamite. The difficulty in resolving this question (two characters or three?) is that the characters are not clearly separated or identified in the text. The three-character reading is difficult because there is no specific person named, except by inference, as the third character.
The language of love and the celebration of those who attend the wedding and the preparation is beautiful. They exchange words of love between the couple, interrupted only by the “daughters of Jerusalem” singing songs, join in with the celebration and glory of human love. The couple has troubles (as the Song recounts, see 5:2-6:2), but they affirmed their love for one another in spite of the difficulties (see 8:5-14).
