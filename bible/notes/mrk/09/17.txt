\v 18 Whenever the spirit attacks him, it throws him down. He foams at the mouth, he grinds his teeth together, and he becomes stiff. I asked your disciples to expel the spirit, but they were not able to do it."

\v 17 Someone in the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son to you; he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak,
\v 18 and it causes him to have convulsions and throws him down; he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out of him, but they could not."
\v 19 He answered them, "Unbelieving generation, how long will I have to stay with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him to me."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - To explain what the scribes and other disciples were arguing about, a father of a demon-possessed man tells Jesus that he has asked the disciples to send the demon out of his son but they could not. Jesus then casts the demon out of the boy. Later the disciples ask why they were not able to send the demon away.

  * **drive it out of him** - "drive the spirit out of my son" or "send the demon away"
  * **bear with you** - "endure you" or "put up with you"
