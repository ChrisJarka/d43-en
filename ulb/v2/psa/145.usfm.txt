\c 145
\d A Psalm of praise; of David.
\q
\v 1 I will extol thee, my God, O King;
\q And I will bless your name for ever and ever.
\q
\v 2 Every day will I bless thee;
\q And I will praise your name for ever and ever.
\q
\v 3 Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised;
\q And his greatness is unsearchable.
\q
\v 4 One generation shall laud your works to another,
\q And shall declare your mighty acts.
\q
\v 5 Of the glorious majesty of your honor,
\q And of your wondrous works, will I meditate.
\q
\v 6 And men shall speak of the might of your terrible acts;
\q And I will declare your greatness.
\q
\v 7 They shall utter the memory of your great goodness,
\q And shall sing of your righteousness.
\q
\v 8 Jehovah is gracious, and merciful;
\q Slow to anger, and of great lovingkindness.
\q
\v 9 Jehovah is good to all;
\q And his tender mercies are over all his works.
\q
\v 10 All your works shall give thanks to thee, O Jehovah;
\q And your saints shall bless thee.
\q
\v 11 They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom,
\q And talk of your power;
\q
\v 12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts,
\q And the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.
\q
\v 13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
\q And your dominion endures throughout all generations.
\q
\v 14 Jehovah upholdeth all that fall,
\q And raises up all those that are bowed down.
\q
\v 15 The eyes of all wait for thee;
\q And you give them their food in due season.
\q
\v 16 You open your hand,
\q And satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
\q
\v 17 Jehovah is righteous in all his ways,
\q And gracious in all his works.
\q
\v 18 Jehovah is near to all them that call upon him,
\q To all that call upon him in truth.
\q
\v 19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him;
\q He also will hear their cry and will save them.
\q
\v 20 Jehovah preserves all them that love him;
\q But all the wicked will he destroy.
\q
\v 21 My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah;
\q And let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
