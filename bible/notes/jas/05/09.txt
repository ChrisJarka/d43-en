\v 9 Do not complain, brothers, against one another, so that you will be not judged. Look, the judge is standing at the door.
\v 10 For an example, brothers, consider the suffering and patience of the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
\v 11 Look, we call those who persevere, "blessed." You have heard of the patience of Job, and you know the purpose of the Lord for Job, how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
