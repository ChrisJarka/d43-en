===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days ... of Judah, saying,** - The idiom "The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah in the days ... of Judah. He said," or "In the days ... of Judah, Yahweh spoke this message to Jeremiah:" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **to Jeremiah** - It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **Rekabites** - This is a people group. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
