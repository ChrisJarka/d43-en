===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he added** - "the criminal also said"
  * **come into your kingdom** - "begin to rule as king" (UDB)
  * **Truly I say to you** - "Truly" adds emphasis to what Jesus is saying. Could be translated as "I want you to know that"
  * **paradise**  - This word is used for the garden of God in Gen. 2 and 3, and for regular gardens in Isa. 1:30 and Jer. 36:5. Here it is a metaphor for God's abode, as in 2 Cor. 12:4 and Rev. 2:7. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]])
