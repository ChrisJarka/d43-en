\v 40-41 But your descendants must confess their sins and the sins that their ancestors committed. Their ancestors acted unfaithfully toward me and were hostile to me, with the result that I forced them to go to the countries that belonged to their enemies. But when your descendants humble themselves \f + \ft synecdoche \f* and stop being very stubborn [IDI] and accept being punished for their sins,
\v 42 I will keep in mind the agreement that I made with \add your ancestors\add* Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and \add what I promised to them about Canaan\add* land.

\v 40 Yet if they will confess their sins and the sins of their fathers, and their treason by which they were unfaithful to me, and also their living against me
\v 41 which caused me to turn against them and give them over into the land of their enemies--If then their uncircumcised hearts are humbled, and they accept the punishment of their sins, 
\v 42 then will I remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.
