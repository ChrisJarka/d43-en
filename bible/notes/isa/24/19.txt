===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The earth will be completely broken, the earth ripped apart; the earth will be violently shaken** - Alternate translation: "Yahweh will violently shake the earth and break it apart" or "The earth will shake violently and break apart." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **The earth will stagger like a drunken man** - This means the earth will rock back and forth like a man who drank too much alcohol. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:simile]])
  * **will sway to and fro like a hammock.** - A hammock is a swinging bed usually made of netting or canvas and held by cords from supports at each end. The violent earthquakes will cause the earth to sway back and forth like a hammock moves in the wind. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:simile]])
  * **The transgression of it will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again** - The word "it" in the phrase "transgression of it" refers to the earth, but it means the people of the earth. Alternate translation: "The sins of the people will be heavy on all the earth, and it will fall and not rise again." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
