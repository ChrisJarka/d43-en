<usfm>
\q
\v 8 He sits in the lurking-places of the villages;
\q In the secret places does he murder the innocent;
\q His eyes are privily set against the helpless.
\q
\v 9 He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert;
\q He lies in wait to catch the poor:
\q He does catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net.
\q
\v 10 He croucheth, he bows down,
\q And the helpless fall by his strong ones.
</usfm>
