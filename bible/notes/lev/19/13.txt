NOTE to Tyler: My team lead in the Psalms workshop had us translating 'Important Words' when the phrase could be simpler to read (without changing the meaning) by substituting only a few words. If you would rather I didn't do this, please let me know. Thanks

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Do not oppress your neighbor or rob him **- To read more clearly, the definition of the Important Word 'oppress' coulbe used instead. AT: "Do not treat your neighbor harshly or rob him."
  * **The wages of a hired servant must not stay with you all night until the morning. **- The information that a servants wages were traditionally paid daily is not clear to the reader. AT: " The wages of a hired servant must be paid when promised". (See Implicit/Explicit)
