**What is Ruth about?**\\

The book of Ruth is a biography of the principle character, Ruth, the daughter-in-law of Naomi. The account begins as Naomi, Ruth and Orpah suffer loss and then Naomi and Ruth make a fateful return to Bethlehem, the home of Naomi’s husband, Elimelech. One of the purposes of the book is to show Ruth’s connection with King David’s monarchy. She was a Moabite woman who became the great-grandmother of King David (Matthew 1:5). It also shows what happens when God’s people follow in faithfulness within the covenant. The story of Ruth has many lessons about faith, fidelity, self-sacrifice, and integrity.  

**How should the title of this book be translated?**\\
While these titles often describe the author or audience of the biblical book, “Ruth” is a reference to the book's main character. Many title choose to summarize the contents of the book. It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or to follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]). 

**Who wrote Ruth?**\\
The author of the book of Ruth is not stated and is unknown. While many suggestions have been made, it is best to see the book as anonymous.

**When did the events of Ruth occur?**\\
Ruth lived during the time when there were judges in Israel.  It is therefore concurrent with the book of Judges, but it was not recorded until after the time of King David.
