===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah is speaking to the people of Jerusalem as if he were speaking to the enemies of Babylon, who cannot hear him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])

  * **Yahweh has opened his armory and is bringing out the weapons for carrying out his anger** - Yahweh's anger that causes him to send enemies against Babylon are spoken of as if Yahweh had an armory and weapons, which he does not. To open an armory is a metonym for preparing for battle. AT: "It was as if Yahweh has prepared for war and is sending the nations to attack Babylon in his anger" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **armory** - this is a building or room where weapons of war were stored
  * **Attack her from far away** - "Come from far away to attack her"
  * **granaries** - buildings where grain is stored
  * **Open her granaries** - Here "granaries" represent where Babylon stored its treasures. AT: "raid the places where the treasures are stored" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **pile her up like heaps of grain** - Possible meanings are 1) reduce the city to piles of rubble that would look like stacks of grain or 2) stack up the plunder from the city like piles of grain. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **set her apart for destruction** - This idiom means to destroy something completely. Translate this as a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:25:07|25:9]]. AT: "destroy her completely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Leave no remnant of her** - This is stated in a negative way to emphasize the completeness of the destruction. AT: "Kill every person in her!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
