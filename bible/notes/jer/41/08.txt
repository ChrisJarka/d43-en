\v 8 There were only ten of them whom they spared\f + \ft Or: did not kill \f*. They were not killed because they promised to Ishmael that \add if he allowed them to remain alive, they would bring him\add* lots of wheat and barley and olive oil and honey that they had hidden.
\v 9 The well where Ishmael's men had thrown the corpses of the men whom they had murdered was the deep well that King Asa's men had dug \add in order that they would have water in the city\add* if the army of King Baasha of Israel would surround the city. Ishmael's men filled that well with corpses.

\v 8 But ten men were found among them that said to Ishmael, Slay us not; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat,
and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and killed them not among their brethren.
\v 9 Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was
that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were
slain.
