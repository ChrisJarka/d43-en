====== Yahweh ======

===== Facts: =====

The term "Yahweh" is God's personal name that he revealed to Moses at the burning bush.

  * The name "Yahweh" comes from the word meaning "to be."
  * Possible meanings include, "he is" or "I am" or "the one who causes to be."
  * This name reveals that God has always lived and will continue to live forever. It also means that he is always present.
  * Many Bible versions in major languages (such as English, French, and Spanish) have used an equivalent of "the LORD" to represent "Yahweh." For example, "I am the LORD your God" is literally, "I am Yahweh your God."
  * However, the ULB and UDB always translate God's personal name as "Yahweh" in the Old Testament, the way it literally occurs.
  * In the New Testament, the personal name "Yahweh" does not occur in the original text. Instead, the term "Lord" is used.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * "Yahweh" could be translated by a word or phrase that means "I am" or "living one" or "the one who is" or "he who is alive."
  * This term could also be written in a way that is similar to how "Yahweh" is spelled.
  * Note that "Jehovah" is //not//  a good translation of this term. Some time in the past, because they were afraid they might mispronounce God's name, the Jews started saying "Lord" instead of Yahweh. Eventually they started using the vowels of the Hebrew word 'Lord' with the consonants of "Yahweh." The word "jehovah" came out of this, which is a different spelling and pronunciation than the original Hebrew word "Yahweh."
