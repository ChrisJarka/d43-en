\v 1 My fellow believers, if you discover that brother or sister is doing wrong, those of you whom God's Spirit is directing should gently correct that person. Furthermore, as you correct another person, you should be very careful so that you do not sin either.
\v 2 When there are brothers or sisters who have problems, you should help each other. By doing that, you will do what Christ commands.
