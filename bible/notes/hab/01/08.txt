====== Habakkuk 01:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 The horses \add that pull their chariots\add* go faster than leopards,
\q2 and they are fiercer than wolves are in the evening.
\q1 The horses on which the soldiers ride gallop swiftly;
\q2 the soldiers riding them come from distant places.
\q1 They are like \f + \ft simile \f* eagles that swoop down to \add snatch and\add* kill small animals.
\q1
\v 9 As they ride along,
\q2 they are determined to act violently.
\q1 They advance like \f + \ft simile \f* a wind from the desert,
\q2 gathering prisoners that are as \add numerous as grains of\add* sand.

\q2 and gather up as many prisoners as there are grains of sand!

\q
\v 8 Their horses also are swifter than leopards, quicker than the evening wolves.
\q So their horses stamp,
\q and their horsemen come from a great distanceâ€”they fly like an eagle hurrying to eat.
\q
\v 9 They all come for violence;
\q their multitudes go like the desert wind, and they gather captives like sand.
\f + \ft The Hebrew text translated here as \fqa their multitudes go like the desert wind \fqa* is very difficult; many modern versions have other interpretations. \f*
