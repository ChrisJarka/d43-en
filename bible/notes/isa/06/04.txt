===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Woe is me! For I am doomed because I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, because my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies!" **- This can be rephrased to better express the logic of Isaiah's exclamation "Woe is me! For I have seen Yahweh of Hosts with my eyes, even though I am always saying sinful things, and I live with a people that is always saying sinful things."
  * **The doors and the thresholds shook at the voices of those who were crying out **- “When the seraphim called out, their voices shook the foundations of the thresholds"
  * **and the house was filled with smoke **- Alternate translation: “and smoke filled the house." (See: Active/Passive)
  * **and the house **- The word "house" here is used to refer to the temple/palace of the Lord.
  * **then I said **- Isaiah is speaking.
  * **a man of unclean lips**  - When Isaiah says that he is a man of unclean lips he means that he often says things correspond well with the holiness of God.

(See: [[:en:ta:translate:metonymy|Metonymy]])
