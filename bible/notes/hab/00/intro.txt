=== What is the Book of Habakkuk about? ===

While many other [[:en:obe:kt:prophet|prophets]] complained about the people, the nation, the enemies, and their sin or failures to obey the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Yahweh]], Habakkuk focuses his complaint against Yahweh. Habakkuk complains about Yahweh using the Babylonians, who were more evil and deserving of Yahweh’s punishment, to punished Israel and Judah.

The book is addressed to the rich people in Judah who mistreated the poor and the evil religious leaders. Because of this [[:en:obe:kt:justice|justice]] is signficant in the boko of Habakkuk.

Translators may decided to translate this traditional title "The book of Habakkuk" in a way that is more clear to the readers.They may decide to call it, "The sayings of Habakkuk." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]).

=== Who wrote Habakkuk? ===

The author of Habakkuk is not known. The name suggests (from an Assyrian word that is very close) the idea of “wrestling” or “holding firm.” The date of Habakkuk may be suggested by the dates of the Chaldean empire, mentioned in several places in Habakkuk.  The Chaldean empire reigned from about 720 to 538 BC. It is probable that Habakkuk wrote about the time of Jeremiah, when Josiah, Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim were kings of Judah.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== How do I identify the speaker? ===

It should be noted that Habakkuk often speaks to Yahweh, and Yahweh replies to him. The translator should be careful to identify the speaker (Habakkuk, or Yahweh) in each section. The translator may wish to make the speaker explicit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])


=== What style of writing is the Book of Habakkuk? ===

While much of the book of Habakkuk is prophecy, the third chapter is a song. This chapter contains information about how to sing this song and uses musical terms. It is probably that Habakkuk had a priestly background.
