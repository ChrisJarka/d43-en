\v 19 If it please the king, have a royal decree be issued from him, and let it be written in the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that can not be altered, that Vashti may no longer come before king Ahasuerus. Let the king give her royal position to another that is more worthy than she.
\v 20 When the kingâ€™s decree that he will make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to the prominent and to the lowly."
