\v 12 The sixth angel poured out his bowl upon the great river, the Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the east.
\v 13 I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, like frogs.
\v 14 For they are spirits of demons, making signs which go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.
