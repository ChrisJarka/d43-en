\v 44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, just as God commanded when he spoke to Moses, that he should make it like the pattern that he had seen.
\v 45 Later, our fathers, under Joshua, received the tabernacle and brought it with them when they took possession of the land. God took the land from the nations and drove them out before the face of our fathers. The tabernacle remained in the land until the time of David,
\v 46 who found favor in the sight of God, and he asked if he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.

  * **our fathers, under Joshua, received the tabernacle and brought it with them** - The phrase "under Joshua" means that their ancestors did these things in obedience to Joshua's direction. AT: "our fathers, in accordance with Joshua's instructions, received the tabernacle and brought it with them"
  * **God took the land from the nations and drove them out before the face of our fathers** - This sentence tells why the ancestors were able to take possession of the land. AT: "God forced the nations to leave the land before the face of our fathers" 
  * **God took the land ... before the face of our fathers** - Here "the face of our fathers" refers to the presence of their ancestors. Possible meanings are 1) "As our ancestors watched, God took the land from the nations and drove them out" or 2) "When our ancestors came, God took the land from the nations and drove them out" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
