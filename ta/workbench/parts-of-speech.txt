Sentence Structure & Parts of Speech


DRAFT - IN PROGRESS


The simplest sentence structure in English includes a subject and a verb.  


The subject is who or what the sentence is about; it uses nouns or pronouns.


The VERB is either an action or a state-of-being word such as is, are, was.  The portion of the sentence which contains the verb is called the predicate.


NOUNS are words that represent a person, place, thing or idea.


PRONOUNS take the place of nouns and include such words as he, she, it, they and we.  More detailed pages on pronouns can be found here:  [[https://door43.org/en/ta/vocabulary/singularpronoun|https://door43.org/en/ta/vocabulary/singularpronoun]] and here [[https://door43.org/en/ta/vocabulary/pluralpronouns|https://door43.org/en/ta/vocabulary/pluralpronouns]].


ARTICLES are the term used to describe the words:  a, an, the.  "The" a definite article which means a specific one (e.g. the dog) instead of a generic description such as "a dog."


Articles are actually part of a larger group of words called ADJECTIVES.  Adjectives describe nouns and convey such things as quantity, size and color.


ADVERBS are a group of words that describe verbs (or adjectives) and tell such things as how, when, why or where.
