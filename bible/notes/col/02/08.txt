====== Colossians 02:8-9 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Make sure that no one forces you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* to become his disciples \f + \ft metaphor \f* by his teaching you a religious philosophy\f + \ft Or: doctrine \f* that is valueless and false. Such a philosophy is false because it teaches what mere human beings think, because it teaches people elementary regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* \add that are concerned merely with what is external\f + \ft Or: physical \f*\add*, and because it teaches what is contrary to \add the true teaching about\add* Christ.
\v 9 \add Make sure of this\add*, because it is in Christ's body that God lives completely.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 Do not believe anyone who says that you must obey what people have taught about how to honor God--or that you must obey what they worship in this world. Instead, obey Christ,
\v 9 because all of God in the man Jesus Christ.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 8 See that no one captures you through the philosophy and the empty deceit that is based on human tradition and upon the sinful belief systems of the world, and not after Christ
\v 9 because in him all the fullness of God's nature lives bodily.
