===== Description =====

Every story has a storyline. The storyline tells a series of events and has a beginning, middle and end. It is full of action verbs that moves the reader along the storyline. Occasionally an author may take a break from the storyline to share something of interest. This break is called **__background information__.**  Often it uses stative verbs like "be" and "feel", rather than action verbs. An author may use background information for several reasons:
  * To add interest to the story.
  * To provide important historical or cultural information.
  * To tell the reader, or listener, something very important



===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Hagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. Abram __was__ eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.**  (Genesis 16:16)\\
The first sentence tells about two events. Hagar gave birth and Abraham named his son. The second sentence is background information about how old Abram was when those things happened. 

**Now Jesus himself, when he began to teach, __was__ about thirty years of age. He __was__ the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli.**   (Luke 3:23) \\ 
The verses before this tell about when Jesus was baptized. This sentence introduces background information about Jesusâ€™ age and ancestors. The story starts up again in chapter 4 where it tells about Jesus going to the wilderness.

===== Translation Strategies =====
To keep translations clear and natural you will need to study the grammar and punctuation of your language. Observe how your language presents background information in writings. Follow those same grammar rules when you translate.

  - See how your language puts background in your own language.
  - Reorder the information so that that earlier events are mentioned first.  
===== Examples of Translation Strategies applied ===== 

1. Use your language's way of showing that certain information is background information.
  * **Now Jesus himself, when he began to teach, __was__ about thirty years of age. He __was__ the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli.** (Luke 3:23) - English uses the word "now" to show that there is some kind of change in the story. The verb "was" shows that it is background information.


2. Reorder the information so that that earlier events are mentioned first. \\ 
  * **Hagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. __Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram__.** (Genesis 16:16)
    * "__When Abram was eighty-six years old__, Hagar gave birth to his son, and Abram named his son Ishmael."
