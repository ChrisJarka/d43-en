\v 1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,
\v 2 to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

\v 3 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of you in my
supplications, night and day
\v 4 longing to see thee, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;
\v 5 having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother
Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in you also.
\v 6 For which cause I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my
hands.
\v 7 For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.
\v 8 Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel
according to the power of God;
\v 9 who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,
which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
\v 10 but has now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and
immortality to light through the gospel,
\v 11 whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.
\v 12 For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded
that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.
\v 13 Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
\v 14 That good thing which was committed to you guard through the Holy Spirit which lives in us.

\v 15 This you knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
\v 16 The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus: for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;
\v 17 but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me
\v 18 (the Lord grant to him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, you
know very well.
