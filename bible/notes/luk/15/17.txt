\v 17 Finally he thought clearly about what he had done. He said to himself, 'All of my father's hired servants have plenty of food! They have more \f + \ft synecdoche \f* than they can eat, but here I am dying because I do not have anything to eat \f + \ft hyperbole \f*!
\v 18 So I will leave here and go back to my father. I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God \f + \ft metonymy, euphemism \f* and against you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add*.
\v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called \f + \ft Or:of \add you\add* calling me \f* your son. Just hire me to be like one of the other hired servants."'

\v 17 Finally he began to think clearly about how foolish he had been and he said to himself: 'All of my father's hired servants have more than enough food to eat but here I am dying because I do not have anything to eat!
\v 18 So I will leave here and go back to my father. I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God and against you.
\v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; please just employ me to work for you as one of your hired servants."'

\v 17 But when the young son came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough food, and I am here, dying from hunger!
\v 18 I will leave here and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.
\v 19 I am no more worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired servants."'

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * (Jesus continues his story.)
    * **when he came to himself** - That is, "when the younger son came to his senses" or "when he began to think clearly" or "when he understood his situation." 
    * **dying from hunger**  - This could also be translated as "starving to death". This is probably not an exaggeration. The young man may really have been starving.
    * **How many of my father's hired hands have more than enough food** - This is not a question, but an exclamation. It could also be translated as "My father's hired servants have more than enough food to eat" (UDB).
    * **I have sinned against heaven** - This could also be translated as, "I have sinned against God." Jewish people sometimes avoided saying the word "God" and used the word "heaven" in order to refer to God.
    * **son** - A son has the legal right to an inheritance from his father.
    * **make me as one of your hired servants** - That is, "hire me as one of your employees" or "hire me and I will become one of your servants."
