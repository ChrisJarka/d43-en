\v 16 Those things will happen to you because you obey only the wicked laws of King Omri,
\q2 and you do the terrible things that King Ahab and his descendants commanded.
\q1 So I will destroy your country,
\q2 and I will cause the other people groups to despise you, my own people."

<usfm>
\q
\v 16 The regulations made by Omri have been kept,
\q and all the deeds of the house of Ahab.
\q You walk by their advice.
\q So I will make you, city, a ruin,
\q and you inhabitants an object of hissing,
\q and you will bear scorn as my people."
\f + \ft The Hebrew text has \fqa you will bear scorn as my people \fqa* , but an ancient Greek version has \fqa you will bear the scorn of the nations \fqa* . Some modern versions follow this reading. \f*

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

  * **The regulations made by Omri have been kept, and all the deeds of the house of Ahab** - This can be translated in active form, and you may need to supply the words that the ellipsis omitted. AT: "You have done what Omri commanded, and you have done the same things the house of Ahab did" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **Omri ... Ahab** - Both of these men were kings over the northern kingdom of Israel. God considered both of them to be very wicked. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **house of Ahab** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. AT: "the descendants of Ahab"
  * **You walk by their advice** - Walking on a path is a metaphor for how a person lives his life. AT: "You do what Omri and Ahab told the people to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I will make you, city, a ruin, and you inhabitants an object of hissing** - Micah speaks to the people of the city, who can hear him, as if he were speaking to the city itself, which cannot hear him. You may need to make explicit the words that the ellipsis omits. AT: "I will make your city a ruin, and I will make you inhabitants an object of hissing" or "I will make you, city, a ruin, and I will cause everyone who sees you inhabitants of the city to hiss at you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
