\v 9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your king comes to thee; he is just, and
having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass.
\v 10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he
shall speak peace to the nations: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
