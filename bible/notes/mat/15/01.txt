===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **violate the tradition of the elders**  - "disobey the rules that our ancestors gave us"
  * **they do not wash their hands **- The word "they" refers to Jesus disciples**.**
  * **wash their hands **- they were not referring to having clean hands for eating, but because the Jews had a tradition that God would think they are good if they washed often. This could be translated "they do not wash their hands the way they are supposed to."
  * **Jesus answered and said to them**  - Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees and scribes only.
  * **And youâ€“why do you **- "You" refers to Pharisees and scribes.
  * **why do you violate the commandment of God **- Jesus is using a rhetorical question to point out their disobedience. (See: Rhetorical Question)
  * **for the sake of your traditions **- The last phrase means "to follow what your ancestors taught you." Their traditions have become more important than obeying God.
