==== Introduction ====

Size matters a lot in stories, especially those in the Bible where there’s a lot of measuring of food and substances for sacrifices. However, it’s easy to lose the significance of each Israelite picking up at least 10 homers of quail (about 60 bushels) after complaining about the manna. Deciding how best to translate volume and maintaining the culture of the original biblical text without losing a reader’s ability to understand it is up to the translator’s discretion. This page will inform you so you can make these decisions intelligently.

==== Description ====

The following terms are the most common units of volume used in the Bible to state how much a certain container could hold. The containers and measurements are given for both liquids (such as wine) and dry solids (such as grain).

^  Type ^  Original Measure ^  Liters |
|  Dry |  omer |  2 liters |
|  Dry |  ephah |  22 liters |
|  Dry |  homer |  220 liters |
|  Dry |  kor |  220 liters |
|  Dry |  seah |  7.7 liters |
|  Dry |  lethek |  114.8 liters |
|  Liquid |  metrete |  40 liters |
|  Liquid |  bath |  22 liters |
|  Liquid |  hin |  3.7 liters |
|  Liquid |  kab |  1.23 liters |
|  Liquid |  log |  0.31 liters |

=== Translation Principles ===

  * The people in the Bible did not use modern measures such as meters, liters, and kilograms. Using the original measures can help readers know that the Bible really was written long ago in a time when people used those measures.
  * Using modern measures can help readers understand the text more easily.
  * Whatever measures you use, it would be good, if possible, to tell about the other kinds of measures in the text or a footnote.

==== When the unit of measure is stated====

=== Translation Strategies ===

  - Use the measurements from the ULB. These are the same kinds of measurements that the original writers used. Spell them in a way that is similar to the way they sound or are spelled in the ULB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate|Copy or Borrow Words]])
  - Use the metric measurements given in the UDB. The translators of the UDB have already figured how to represent the amounts in the metric system.
  - Use measurements that are already used in your language. In order to do this you would need to know how your measurements relate to the metric system and figure out each measurement.
  - Use the measurements from the ULB and include measurements that your people know in the text or a note.
  - Use measurements that your people know, and include the measurements from the ULB in the text or in a note.

=== Translation Strategies Applied ===

The strategies are all applied to Isaiah 5:10 below.

  * **For four hectares of vineyard will yield only one bath, and one homer of seed will yield only an ephah.**  (Isaiah 5:10 ULB)
1. Use the measurements from the ULB. These are the same kinds of measurements that the original writers used. Spell them in a way that is similar to the way they sound or are spelled in the ULB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_transliterate|Copy or Borrow Words]])

  * "For four hectares of vineyard will yield only one __bat__, and one __homer__  of seed will yield only an __efa__."

2. Use the measurements given in the UDB. Usually they are metric measurements. The translators of the UDB have already figured how to represent the amounts in the metric system.

  * "For four hectares of vineyard will yield only __twenty-two liters__, and __ten baskets__  of seed will yield only __one basket__."
      * "For four hectares of vineyard will yield only __twenty-two liters__  and __220 liters__  of seed will yield only __twenty-two liters__."

3. Use measurements that are already used in your language. In order to do this you would need to know how your measurements relate to the metric system and figure out each measurement.

  * "For four hectares of vineyard will yield only six gallons, and __six and a half bushes__  of seed will yield only twenty quarts."

4. Use the measurements from the ULB and include measurements that your people know in the text or a note. The following shows both measurements in the text.

  * "For four hectares of vineyard will yield only __one bath (six gallons)__, and __one homer (six and a half bushels)__  of seed will yield only __an ephah (twenty quarts)__."

5. Use measurements that your people know, and include the measurements from the ULB in the text or in a note. The following shows the ULB measurements in notes.

  * "For four hectares of vineyard will yield only twenty-two liters<sup>1</sup> , and 220 liters<sup>2</sup>   of seed will yield only twenty-two liters<sup>2</sup> ."
      * <sup>1</sup>  one bath
      * <sup>2</sup>  one home
      * <sup>3</sup>  one ephah

==== When the unit of measure is implied ====

Sometimes the Hebrew does not specify a particular unit of volume but only uses a number. In these cases, many English versions, including the ULB and UDB, add the word "measure."

  * **whenever anyone came to the grainery for __twenty measures__  of grain, there were only __ten__, and whenever someone came to the wine vat to draw out __fifty measures__  of wine, there were only __twenty__.**  (Haggai 2:16 ULB)
=== Translation Strategies ===

  - Translate literally by using the number without a unit.
  - Use a generic word like "measure" or "quantity" or "amount."
  - Use the name of an appropriate container, such as "basket" for grain or "jar" for wine.
  - Use a unit of measure that you are already using in your translation.

=== Translation Strategies Applied ===

The strategies are all applied to Haggai 2:16 below.

  * **whenever anyone came to the grainery for __twenty measures__  of grain, there were only __ten__, and whenever someone came to the wine vat to draw out __fifty measures__  of wine, there were only __twenty__.**  (Haggai 2:16 ULB)
1. Translate literally by using the number without a unit.

  * "whenever anyone came to the grainery for __twenty__  of grain, there were only __ten__, and whenever someone came to the wine vat to draw out __fifty__  of wine, there were only __twenty__."

2. Use a generic word like "measure" or "quantity" or "amount."

  * "whenever anyone came to the grainery for __twenty amounts__  of grain, there were only __ten__, and whenever someone came to the wine vat to draw out __fifty amounts__  of wine, there were only __twenty__."

3. Use the name of an appropriate container, such as "basket" for grain or "jar" for wine.

  * "whenever anyone came to the grainery for __twenty baskets__  of grain, there were only __ten__, and whenever someone came to the wine vat to draw out __fifty jars__  of wine, there were only __twenty__."

4. Use a unit of measure that you are already using in your translation.

  * "whenever anyone came to the grainery for __twenty liters__  of grain, there were only __ten liters__, and whenever someone came to the wine vat to draw out __fifty liters__  of wine, there were only __twenty liters__."
