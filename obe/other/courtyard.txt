====== courtyard ======


===== Definition: =====

A courtyard is an enclosed area that is surrounded by a building or walls. It has no roof, but rather is open to the sky.

    * The temple building in Jerusalem had a courtyard around it. The walls surrounding this courtyard were made of stone. This courtyard was called the "inner courtyard."
    * God's people were permitted to go into the inner courtyard to worship God, but only the priests were permitted to go into the temple building.
    * Part of the inner courtyard was called the Women's Courtyard which had a special gate for the women to use.
    * The outer courtyard of the temple was outside the inner courtyard and was surrounded by the outside walls of the temple complex.
    * The outer, larger courtyard was also called the "Court of the Gentiles" because this was the only place in the temple complex that Gentiles, or nonJews, were permitted to be.

==== Translation Suggestions: ====


    * The term "courtyard" could be translated as "enclosed space" or "walled-in land" or "temple grounds" or "temple enclosure."
    * Sometimes the term "temple" can be translated as "temple courtyards" when that is what is being referred to.
