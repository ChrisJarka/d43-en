===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Blessed is the man who endures testing, for after he has passed the test, he will receive the crown of life, which has been promised to those who love God.
\v 13 No one should say when he is tempted, "This temptation is from God," because God is not tempted by evil, and God himself does not tempt anyone.
