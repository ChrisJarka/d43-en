===== Facts: God's law or the law of the Lord refers to the Mosaic law as given in the Old Covenant. =====


    * God's law was first delivered by Moses at Mount Sinai, and a second time in the wilderness after the original disobedient generation had died.
    * When Jewish people refer to the law of the Lord they are usually making reference to the Law of Moses, separating it from the Prophets and the Kethubim or "writings" (poetic material).
    * The term God's law when used today can mean the entire Old Testament portion of the Bible.
