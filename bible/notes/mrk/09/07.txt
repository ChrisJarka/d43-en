  * [[:en:obe:kt:beloved]]

  * [[:en:obe:kt:jesus]]
===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus had taken Peter, James, and John up a high mountain where Jesus appeared in bright white clothes.

  * **"This is my beloved Son. Listen to him."** - The Father expresses his love for his Son, Jesus. Without the word "Son" in the translation in your language, what the Bible says about God the Father and Jesus Christ will not be adequately communicated. Use the closest expression you have in your language for "Son" for Jesus when Scripture describes him as the "Son of God," the Son of the Father.
