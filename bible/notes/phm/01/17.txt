===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 17 So, if you consider me to be your partner \add in God's work\add*, receive him as you would receive me. \v 18 If he has wronged you in any manner or if he owes you anything, charge that to me\f + \ft Or: tell me so that I can pay you \f*. \v 19 I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you, although I might mention to you that you owe me even more than Onesimus may owe you, because it was the result of my telling you about Christ that God saved your soul\f + \ft Or: you \f*.

\p \v 20 Yes\f + \ft Or: I say it again \f*, my dear friend, because you and I both have a relationship with the Lord, I want you to do this for me. Encourage me \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add by receiving Onesimus kindly, just like you encourage others who believe\add* in Christ.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 17 So if you believe that you and I are doing God's work together, welcome him as you would welcome me. \v 18 If he has done you any kind of harm, or if he is in debt to you, Ilet me take the responsibility for that. \v 19 I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you. I could say to you that you owe me even more than Onesimus owes you, because what I told you saved your own life.

\p \v 20 Indeed, my brother, cause me to rejoice with the Lord. Give me courage in Christ.

\p </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 17 If then you regard me a partner, receive him as myself. \v 18 But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my own account. \v 19 I, Paul, write with mine own hand: I will repay it:. I do not mention to you that you owe me your very life. \v 20 Yes, brother, let me have joy in the Lord from joy; refresh my heart in Christ. </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **If then you regard me a partner,** -  "If you think of me as a fellow worker for Christ"
  * **But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my own account** - The phrase "wronged you at all, or owes you anything" is a doublet and emphasizes that Paul will pay everything that Onesimus owes. It could be translated as "I will pay for whatever Onesimus owes you." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
  * **I, Paul, write with mine own hand;** - Here the word "hand" is a synecdoche that refers to Paul. This could be translated as "I, Paul, write this myself." (See: [[en:ta:translate:synecdoche]])
  * **I will repay it** - "I will pay what he owes you"
  * **I do not mention to you** - Paul is using irony here to emphasize that he actually is mentioning this to Philemon. This could be translated as "I must also remind you" or "Remember" or "Do not forget". (See: [[en:ta:translate:irony]])
  * **you owe me your very life** - The reason Philemon owes Paul his life can be made explicit: "you owe me your very life because I was the one who taught you about Jesus so that you became a believer." (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
  * **refresh my heart** - Here "heart" is a metonym and refers to emotions or thoughts. It could be translated as "give me courage" (UDB) or "give me comfort." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
