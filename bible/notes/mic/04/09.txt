\v 9 Now, why do you shout so loudly?
\q Is there no king among you?
\q Has your counselor died?
\q Is this why pain grips you like that of a woman in labor?
\q
\v 10 Be in pain
\q and labor to give birth,
\q daughter of Zion,
\q like a woman in labor.
\q For now you will you go out of the city,
\q live in the field,
\q and go to Babylon.
\q There you will be rescued.
\q There Yahweh will rescue you
\q from the hand of your enemies.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Now, why do you shout so loudly?** - Micah is mocking the people, trying to make them think about why God is dealing with them in this way. AT: "Look at how you are shouting loudly." or "Think carefully about why you are shouting loudly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Is there no king among you? Has your counselor died? Is this why pain grips you like that of a woman in labor?** - Micah continues to mock the people. AT: "You have a king, but he is useless to you. All your wise people are still alive, but they have nothing wise to say to you. This is why you are weeping loudly like a woman who is giving birth to a baby." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Be in pain ... like a woman in labor** - Micah mocks the people by using irony to command them to suffer greatly. AT: "You will be in pain ... like a woman in labor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]]) 
  * **There you will be rescued. There Yahweh will rescue you** - Yahweh says the same thing in both active and passive forms to emphasize that he will do what he has said he will do. This can be translated in active form. AT: "There Yahweh will rescue you. There he will rescue you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the hand of your enemies** - The word "hand" could be a metonym for the power that the hand exercises. AT: "the power of your enemies" Or it could be a synecdoche for the person. AT: "your enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
