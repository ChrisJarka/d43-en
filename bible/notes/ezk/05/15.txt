<usfm> \v 15 They will make fun of you and taunt you. When I severely punish you because of my great anger, they will be horrified and you will be a warning to them. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it. \v 16 And when I cut off your food supply and cause there to be more famine, it will be as though I am shooting at you with my arrows that will destroy you. \v 17 So I will cause you to experience a famine, and I will send wild beasts to attack you and your children, and all your children will be killed. You will experience plagues and wars, and I will cause your enemies to attack you with their swords. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it." </usfm>

<usfm> \v 15 So Jerusalem will become a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror to the nations that surround you; when I will execute judgments against you in wrath and fury, and with a furious rebuke–I, Yahweh have declared this!— \v 16 and when I send out harsh arrows of famine against them that will become the destruction that I will send to destroy you, since I will increase the famine upon you and break your staff of bread! \v 17 Then I will send a famine against you, and harshness so you will be childless. Plague and blood will pass through you, and I will bring a sword upon you. I, Yahweh, have declared this! </usfm>
