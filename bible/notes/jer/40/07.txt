\v 7 All the princes of the army that were in the field—they and their men—heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam over the land and 
that he had appointed to him men, women, and children and the poor people of the land who were not exiled to Babylon;
\v 8 so they went to Gedaliah in Mitzpah: Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, 
and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite. They and their men.
