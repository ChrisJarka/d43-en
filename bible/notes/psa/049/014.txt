<usfm>
\q
\v 14 They are appointed, like a flock, to go to sheol;
\q death will be their shepherd;
\q the upright will have power over them in the morning;
\q their beauty will be for sheol to consume
\q so that there be no habitation for it.
\q
\v 15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of sheol;
\q he will receive me. 
\qs Selah\qs*

===== Translation Notes: =====
The author continues to describe people who believe their wealth will save them.

  * **like a flock**- People are compared to a flock of sheep because they will follow their shepherd. (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **death will be their shepherd** - This phrase refers to death and the person who leads sheep.  This means the choices of the people will only result in their deaths. AT: "death will take them away as a shepherd leads away sheep to be slaughtered" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **in the morning**  - Night is associated with death so the morning refers to after they die. AT: "after they die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **there will be no habitation for it** - "there will be no place for it to live"  It is like beauty has no home in sheol because it will not be able to continue to exist there. AT: "it will not continue to exist" 
  * **redeem my soul** - The author refers to himself by the part of him that exists apart from his body. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the power of sheol** - AT: "the power of sheol to consume me" or "the power of sheol to make me no longer exist" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
