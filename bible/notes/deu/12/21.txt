\v 21 If the place which Jehovah your God shall choose, to put his name there, be too far from thee, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which Jehovah has given thee, as I have commanded thee; and you may eat within your gates, after all the desire of your soul.
\v 22 Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so you shall eat thereof: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike.
