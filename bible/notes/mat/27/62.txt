\v 62 Now on the morrow, which is the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered
together to Pilate,
\v 63 saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.
\v 64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away,
and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.
