\v 4 Like a woman who is unfaithful to her husband, you are being unfaithful to God and not obeying him anymore. Those who are behaving as evil people do are hostile toward God. Perhaps you do not realize that. So those who decide to act as evil people do become enemies of God.
\v 5 Surely you do not think that it is for no reason that God told us in the Scriptures that the human spirit that God placed in humans now deeply desires evil things, like envying and jealousy.  Everyone now has evil desires when they are born because evil desires entered human thinking when Adam and Eve commited evil in the Garden of Eden. Now every person receives evil desires from Adam and Eve in their inner beings because Adam and Eve are the ancestor father and ancestor mother of every person who have ever lived.

NOTE: Here is the original TfT end of verse 5:
he eagerly desires that his Spirit, who lives in us, will help us to love God only! God has a reason for desiring that.

\v 4 You adulteresses! Don't you know that friendship with the world is hostility against God? Therefore, whoever decides to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
\v 5 Or do you think the scripture is useless when it says that the human spirit God placed in us is now filled with envy?
