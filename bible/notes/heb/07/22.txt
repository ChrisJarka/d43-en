===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Because of that, Jesus guarantees that \add the new\add* covenant will be better \add than the old one\add*.
\p
\v 23 And formerly, the priests could not keep serving \add as priests\add*, because they all died \f + \ft personification \f*. So there were many priests \add to take the place of the ones who died\add*.
\v 24 But because \add Jesus\add* lives eternally, he will continue to be a high priest forever.

\v 22 Because of that, Jesus himself guarantees that the new covenant will be better than the old one.
\p
\v 23 And formerly, priests could not keep serving as priests because they would always die. So there were many priests to take the place of the ones who died.
\v 24 But because Jesus lives eternally, he will continue to be a high priest forever.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 22 By this also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
\v 23 Indeed, death prevents priests from serving forever. This is why there are many priests, one after another.
\v 24 But because Jesus lives forever, his priesthood is unchangeable.
