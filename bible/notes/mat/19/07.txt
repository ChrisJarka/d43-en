<usfm> \v 7 The Pharisees then said to him, "If that is true, why did Moses command that \add a man who wanted to divorce\add* his wife should give her a paper \add stating his reason for\add* divorcing her, and then send her away?" \v 8 He said to them, "It was because\add your ancestors\add* stubbornly \add wanted their own ways\add* that Moses allowed them to divorce their wives, \add and you are no different from them\add*. But when God first \f + \ft metonymy \f* created a man and a woman, \add he did not intend for them to separate\add*. \v 9 I am telling you emphatically that \add because God considers that a marriage lasts until either the husband or the wife dies, he considers that\add* any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman is committing adultery, unless\add his first wife\add* has committed adultery." </usfm>

<usfm> \v 7 They say to him, "Why then did Moses command us to give a certificate of divorcement, and then to divorce her?" \v 8 He said to them, "For your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not that way. \v 9 I say to you, Whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and the man who marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery." </usfm>

  * **man who marries a woman who is divorced - **  Since the woman is still considered by God to be married to her previous husband, anyone who marries a divorced woman is also committing adultery.
