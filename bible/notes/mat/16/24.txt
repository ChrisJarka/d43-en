\v 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If any one of you wants to be my disciple, you must not do only what you yourself want to do. You must be willing to let people hurt you and disgrace you. That is like what they do to criminals whom they force to carry a cross to the place where the criminals will be executed. That is what anyone who wants to be my disciple must do.
\v 25 You must do that, because those who try to save their lives by denying that they belong to me when people want to kill them for believing in me will not live eternally, but those who are killed because they are my disciples will live with God eternally.
\v 26 People might get everything they want in this world, but if they do not become my disciples, they will really be gaining nothing because they will not get eternal life. There is nothing that God will accept in exchange for a person's life.

\v 24 Then said Jesus to his disciples, "If any one wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and 
follow me.
\v 25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
\v 26 For what does it profit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? What can a person give in 
exchange for his life?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell his disciples the cost of following him.

  * **follow me**  - "to come with me as a disciple"
  * **deny himself **- This could be translated as "not give in to his own desires" or "forsake his own desires."
  * **take up his cross **- "lift us his cross and carry it" This metaphor refers to our submitting to God and being willing to suffer and die for Christ. (See: Metaphor)
  * **For whoever wants**  - "whoever" means anyone
  * **For what does it profit a person **- This can be translated as "how does a person benefit." This is part of a rhetorical question. It could also be translated as "it does not benefit a man" or "A man does not receive anything good." (See: Rhetorical questions)
  * **if he gains the whole world **- "if he gains everything in the world"
  * **but forfeits his life**  - This can be translated as "he himself is lost or destroyed."
  * **What can a person give in exchange for his life? **- This question was asked to make them think about the importance of following him. They are written as statements in the UDB. (See: Rhetorical Question)
