====== fruit, fruitful ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "fruit" literally refers to the part of a plant that can be eaten. Something that is "fruitful" has a lot of fruit. These terms are also used figuratively in the Bible.

  * The Bible often uses "fruit" to refer to a person's actions and thoughts. Just as fruit on a tree shows what kind of tree it is, in the same way a person's words and actions reveal what his character is like.
  * A person can produce good or bad spiritual fruit, but the term "fruitful" always has the positive meaning of producing much good fruit.
  * The term "fruitful" is also used figuratively to mean "prosperous." This often refers to having many children and descendants, as well as having plenty of food and other wealth.
  * The phrase "fruit of the land" refers generally to everything that the land produces for people to eat. This includes not only fruits such as grapes or dates, but also vegetables, nuts, and grains.
  * The Bible uses the term "fruit of the Spirit" to refer to the godly qualities that the Holy Spirit produces in the lives of those who obey him.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * It is best to use the general word for "fruit" that is commonly used in the local language area to refer to the edible fruit of a fruit tree. In many languages it may be more natural to say, "fruits" whenever it is referring to more than one fruit.
  * Depending on the context, the term "fruitful" could be translated as "producing much spiritual fruit" or "having many children" or "prosperous." In most contexts it is best to keep the term "fruit" in the translation of this term.
  * The phrase, "fruit of the land" could also be translated as, "food that the land produces" or "food crops that are growing in that region."
  * When God created animals and people, he commanded them to "be fruitful and multiply." This is a figurative expression that refers to having many offspring. If a literal translation would not give the correct meaning, this could also be translated as, "have many offspring" or "have many children and descendants" or "have many children so that you will have many descendants."
  * The idiom "fruit of the womb" literally means, "what grows in a woman's womb" the womb produces" or "what comes from a woman's womb" and could be translated as "children." The project language may also have a different idiom for this.
  * Another idiom, "fruit of the vine" could be translated as "vine fruit" or "grapes."
  * Depending on the context, the phrase "will be more fruitful" could also be translated as, "will produce more fruit" or "will have many more children."
  * The apostle Paul's expression, "fruitful labor" could be translated as, "work that brings very good results" or "efforts that result in many people believing in Jesus."
  * In some contexts, the term "fruitful" could also be translated as "prosperous."
  * The "fruit of the Spirit" could also be translated as "works that the Holy Spirit produces" or "words and actions that show the Holy Spirit working in you."
