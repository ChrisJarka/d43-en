\v 15 So I myself also lifted up my hand for them in the wilderness not to bring them into the land that I had given, flowing with milk and honey 
which was a beautiful ornament for all the lands.
\v 16 Because they rejected my judgments and did not walk in my statutes, and they profaned my Sabbaths since their hearts walked after 
their idols.
 
\v 17 But my eye had compassion for them from their destruction, so I did not annihilate them in the wilderness.
