\p
\v 1 When anyone brings a  grain offering to Yahweh, his offering must be fine flour, and he will pour oil on it  and put incense on it.
\v 2 He is to take the offering to Aaronâ€™s sons the priests, and there the priest will take out a handful of the fine flour with the oil and the incense on it. Then the priest will burn the offering upon the altar to gratefully think about Yahweh's goodness, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to Yahweh.
\v 3 Whatever is left of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is something set apart for God from the offerings to Yahweh made by fire.
