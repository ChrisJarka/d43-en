  * **The word of Yahweh came to me and said** - AT: "Yahweh spoke to me and said"
  * **The hands of Zerubbabel...his hands shall also finish it** - Zerubbabel oversees the building of the temple. The building is referred to as "his hands" even though his own hands may not have laid the stones. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) 
  * **laid the foundation** - The foundation is base of a building and the first part of the building project. AT: "began building"

  * **the day of small things** - This phrase is a title for the time period where each day simple tasks were done. Together, these small tasks built the temple. The entire time of building is referred to as one day even though it took several years to complete. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **plumb stone** - a stone that is connected to a rope. This is used to determine if the walls of a building are being built straight up or crooked.
