\v 17 Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. And this I command in all the churches.
\v 18 Was any man called being circumcised? Do not let him become uncircumcised. Has any been called in uncircumcision? Do not let him be circumcised.

\v 20 Let each man remain in that calling wherein he was called.
