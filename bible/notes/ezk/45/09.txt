\v 9 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: "It is enough for you, princes of Israel! Remove violence and strife; do justice and righteousness! Quit your evictions of my people!" This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 10 "You must have accurate balances, accurate ephahs, and accurate baths!
\v 11 The ephah and the bath will be the same amount, so that a bath will be a tenth of a homer; the ephah will be a tenth of a homer. Their measure will be corresponding to the homer.
\v 12 The shekel will be twenty gerahs; sixty shekels will make a mina for you.
