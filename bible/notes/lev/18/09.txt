\v 9 Never seek sexual relations with  your sister, or the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother, whether she was born at  home or born somewhere else. You must never consider sexual relations with them.
\v 10 Never consider sexual relations with your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter. Do not even seek to look upon them in that way. Their hearts and lives need you in much more profound ways.
\v 11 Do not consider sexual relations with your father's wife's daughter, who was fathered by your father. She is your sister, and you must not consider sexual relations with her.
