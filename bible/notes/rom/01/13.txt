I have wanted to come in order that I might help you to mature spiritually \f + \ft idiom \f*, as \add I have helped people to mature spiritually\add* in many other non-Jewish groups \f + \ft hyperbole \f*.
\v 14 I feel obliged \add to proclaim the good message to all non-Jewish people\add*, specifically to \add people who know\add* the Greek \add language and culture\add* and to those who do not know it, to people who are educated and to those who are uneducated.
\v 15 As a result, what I have eagerly desired is that I might proclaim this good message to you who are living in Rome also.

\v 13 Now I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that often I purposed to come to you--and was hindered until now--that I might have some fruit in you just as there was among the rest of the Gentiles.
\v 14 I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish.
\v 15 So, as for me, I am ready to proclaim the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
