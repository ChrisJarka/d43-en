\c 135
\q
\v 1 Praise you Jehovah.
\q Praise you the name of Jehovah;
\q Praise him, O you servants of Jehovah,
\q
\v 2 You that stand in the house of Jehovah,
\q In the courts of the house of our God.
\q
\v 3 Praise you Jehovah; for Jehovah is good:
\q Sing praises to his name; for it is pleasant.
\q
\v 4 For Jehovah has chosen Jacob to himself,
\q And Israel for his own possession.
\q
\v 5 For I know that Jehovah is great,
\q And that our Lord is above all gods.
\q
\v 6 Whatsoever Jehovah pleased, that has he done,
\q In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;
\q
\v 7 Who causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth;
\q Who makes lightnings for the rain;
\q Who brings forth the wind out of his treasuries;
\q
\v 8 Who struck the firstborn of Egypt,
\q Both of man and beast;
\q
\v 9 Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
\q Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants;
\q
\v 10 Who struck many nations,
\q And killed mighty kings,
\q
\v 11 Sihon king of the Amorites,
\q And Og king of Bashan,
\q And all the kingdoms of Canaan,
\q
\v 12 And gave their land for a heritage,
\q A heritage to Israel his people.
\q
\v 13 Your name, O Jehovah, endures for ever;
\q Your memorial name, O Jehovah, throughout all generations.
\q
\v 14 For Jehovah will judge his people,
\q And repent himself concerning his servants.
\b
\q
\v 15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
\q The work of menâ€™s hands.
\q
\v 16 They have mouths, but they speak not;
\q Eyes have they, but they see not;
\q
\v 17 They have ears, but they hear not;
\q Neither is there any breath in their mouths.
\q
\v 18 They that make them shall be like to them;
\q Yea, every one that trusts in them.
\q
\v 19 O house of Israel, bless you Jehovah:
\q O house of Aaron, bless you Jehovah:
\q
\v 20 O house of Levi, bless you Jehovah:
\q You that fear Jehovah, bless you Jehovah.
\q
\v 21 Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion,
\q Who lives at Jerusalem.
\q Praise you Jehovah.
