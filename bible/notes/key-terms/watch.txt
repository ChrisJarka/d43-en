====== watch ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible the term "watch" refers to a period of time that a person was assigned to act as a guard.

  * The terms "morning watch", "evening watch" or similar refer to the time when the person performed their duty.
  * The person keeping watch would normally do so from a high vantage point such as a city wall or "watch tower".
  * Jesus stated "watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation" (Matt 14:28). Paul told Timothy to "Watch your life and doctrine closely" (1 Timothy 4:16).  These refer to the believer being careful not to fall into error or sin.
