\v 15 These people shouted at the priests and prophets, saying, 
\q2 "Stay away from us! Do not touch us!"

\q
\v 14 They wandered, blind, through the streets.
\q They were so defiled by that blood that no one was allowed to touch their clothes.
\q
\v 15 "Away! Unclean!" people cried at them. "Away! Away! Do not touch!"
\q So they wandered about; people said among the nations, "They can stay here no longer."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **They wandered, blind, through the streets** - The priests and prophets are spoken of as if they were blind because they wandered through the streets, not knowing where to go. AT: "They wandered through the streets like blind men" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **They were so defiled by that blood** - Here "defiled" represents being unacceptable to God. Because the priests and prophets murdered people, they were ritually unclean, unable to worship God or be with ordinary people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **defiled by that blood** - "defiled by the blood that they shed." Possible meanings are 1) the blood was on their clothes or 2) "blood" is a metonym for murder. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Away! Unclean** - "Go away! You are unclean"
  * **Away! Away! Do not touch** - "Go away! Go away! Do not touch us"
