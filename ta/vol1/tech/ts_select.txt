**Note:** The first time you use the application, translationStudio opens at the **Translation Projects** screen so you can select the target language. 

On the 'Your Translation Projects' screen:
  - Tap the blue circle with a + sign
  - Swipe up (place a finger on the white area and slide up) to find the target language or tap the look-up icon located at the top right of the screen. The look-up icon is a circle with a line that looks like a magnifying glass.
  - The search field opens and the keyboard appears. Type the first few letters of your language to show that portion of the language list.
  - Tap on your language. The keyboard should disappear.
  - Choose a project from the 'Bible: NT', 'Bible: OT' or 'Open Bible Stories' to start translating.
    - In the Bible: NT or Bible: OT projects you will need to then choose a book for the project.
    - An Open Bible Stories project will open to the first paragraph of The Creation.
  - The new translation project opens showing the 'Consume' section.


== You can select and change your source language whenever you use translationStudio. ==

Complete these steps to select or change the source language, which is the language you are translating FROM:
In the translation project:
  - You may also tap the square icon with the + and - sign found at the top right of the source text window.
  - Tap the empty square box next to the desired source language.
  - Tap on "Confirm" at the bottom of the window to save the selection. Or, tap on "Cancel" to close and not save the selected language. There MUST be a source language chosen.

**Note:** At this time there is no way to change the language you are translating TO. You should start a new project and choose the desired target language.
