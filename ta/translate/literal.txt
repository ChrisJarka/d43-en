===== What are Literal Translations? =====

Literal translations focus on the form of the text.\\
=== Other Names ===
Literal translations are also called:
  * form-based
  * modified literal
  * word-for-word substitution

=== Form Over Meaning ===
Literal translations change the form of source text as little as possible, even if it results in reduced clarity of meaning. An extreme version of a literal translation would not be a translation at all—it would have the same characters and words as the source language. The next closest step would be to replace each word in the source language with an equivalent word from the receptor language. Because of differences in grammar between languages, the receptor audience would probably not understand this kind of translation.

=== Weaknesses of Literal Translation ===
Literal translations usually contain the following problems:
  * foreign words that are not understood by the receptor audience
  * word order that is stilted or awkward in the receptor language
  * idioms that are not used or understood in the receptor language
  * names of objects that do not exist in the receptor culture
  * descriptions of customs that are not understood in the receptor culture
  * place names that have no meaning for the receptor audience

==== There are several problems with translations that are too literal. ====

**1. The meaning of forms change**\\
Supporters of very literal translations correctly understand a basic principle of translation—that the form affects the meaning. However, they often forget that the understanding of forms varies with the culture. When culture changes, forms may be understood in very different ways. It is not possible to protect the meaning from change by keeping the original forms. The only way to protect the meaning is to change to new forms that communicate the same meaning in the new culture as the old forms did in the old culture.\\
**2. Some terms do not have equivalents in other cultures**\\
The Bible contains many terms for things that no longer exist, such as ancient weights (stadia, cubit), money (denarius, stater) and measures (hin, ephah). Animals in Scripture may not exist in some parts of the world (fox, camel). Other words may be unknown in some cultures (snow, circumcision). It is not possible to simply substitute equivalent words for these terms in those situations. The translator must find another way to communicate the original meaning.\\
**3. The Bible was intended to be understood**\\
The testimony of the Scriptures themselves shows that they were meant to be understood. The Bible is written in three languages because the language of the people changed. When the Jews returned from exile and no longer remembered Hebrew, the priests translated the Old Testament readings into Aramaic so they could understand (Neh 8:8). And the New Testament is written in the common Koine Greek that everyone spoke instead of in classical Greek.
These and other reasons demonstrate that the God wants people to understand His Word. The meaning of the Scriptures is more important than the form.\\
