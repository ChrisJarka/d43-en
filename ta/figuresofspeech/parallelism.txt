====== Parallelism ======

**Parallelism ** is the expression of one idea in two or more different ways. Parallelism is most commonly found in the book of Psalms and Proverbs but is found throughout the whole of the Hebrew Bible.

There are several reasons for parallelism in poetry:

  * Emphasizes something of great importance.
  * Much of the Hebrew text was sung and poetic writing is easier to sing.
  * Poems and songs are easier to memorize than straight texts.
  * The Hebrew writers believed that if something is worth saying, it is worth saying 'beautifully.'

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Do not judge, and you will not be judged\\
Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned.** Luke 6:37\\
This is a doublet. Judging others and condemning others are very similar.

**My soul magnifies the Lord.\\
My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.** Luke 1:46-47 (WEB)\\
This is a doublet. These two phrases mean basically the same thing.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * When a doublet is used in poetry, a sermon, or prophecy, either keep the doublet, or use your own culture's way of emphasizing the point in poetry, sermons, and prophecies.
  * When the doublet is used in a story (a narrative text), either keep the doublet or use your own culture's way of emphasizing the point in narrative.
