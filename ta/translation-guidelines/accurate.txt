====== Creating Accurate Translations ======

To be ACCURATE when translating the Bible means to: Discover the meaning a passage.  Read each paragraph in a few different translations before you translate it.  Identify the theme of a paragraph, and then write your translation accurately and naturally with the authorâ€™s original focus in mind.

**Culture, Text and Meaning** - Whenever you translate the scriptures you should be aware of how the culture during the time the text was written affects the meaning of the text. This seven minute video will explain how God spoke to many different cultures, the authors were from diverse cultures, culture and language shaped each portion, and that God wants to communicate a specific meaning in his Word.
