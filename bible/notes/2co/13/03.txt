\v 4 It is true that Christ seemed to be weak when he was crucified . But it is also true that he now lives because God worked powerfully to make him alive again. Similarly, as I serve God, I also am a weak human being as Christ was. But I also have a close relationship with Christ who is now alive again. And with his authority I will use God's power to discipline you.

\v 3 since you are seeking evidence  that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak toward you, but he is powerful in you.
\v 4 For he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him by the power of God when dealing with you.
