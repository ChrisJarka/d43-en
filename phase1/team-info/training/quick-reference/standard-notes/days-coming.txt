Sometimes future events are spoken of as if the days when those events will happen are coming. Also events happening soon are sometimes spoken of as if they are near.

===== Standard Notes: =====

**days are coming when** - Future time is spoken of as if the "days are coming." AT: "in the future" or "there will be a time when" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])

I have note written standard notes for the following, but if we still need to write any, they could be similar to the note above.

OT & NT\\ 
"day is coming" 5x in OT \\ 
"coming day" 4x in OT \\ 
"time is coming" 2x in OT, 1x in NT  \\
"day is near" 2x in OT
"time is near" 1x in OT
