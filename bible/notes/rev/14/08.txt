===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Fallen, fallen** - This word is repeated for emphasis. It means "completely destroyed."
  * **Babylon the great** - "Babylon the large city" or "the important city of Babylon." This was probably a symbol for the city of Rome, which was large, wealthy, and sinful. 
  * **drink the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality** - Drinking the wine of God's wrath is a symbol for being punished and suffering. God was angry because, like Babylon, they were sexually immoral. AT: "be punished by drinking the wine of God's wrath because they were sexually immoral" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_symlanguage]])
  * **pursuaded all the nations to drink the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality** - "persuaded all the nations to be sexually immoral and so have to drink the wine of God's wrath"
  * **her sexual immorality** - This may well have a double meaning: literal sexual immorality and also the worship of false gods. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
