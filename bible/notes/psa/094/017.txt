===== translationNotes: =====


  * **Unless Yahweh had been my help** -  The abstract noun "help" can be translated with the verb "help." "If Yahweh had not helped me." Yahweh did help him, so he was not lying in the place of silence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **I would soon be lying down in the place of silence** - "in a short time, I would be dead, lying in a silent grave"
  * **When cares within me threaten to overwhelm me** - The psalmist speaks of as if it were water that could cover and drown him. If large bodies of water are unknown in your culture, use sand or some other material that can cover and kill people or state the idea directly. AT: "When I have more problems than I can handle" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **your comfort makes me happy** - AT: "you comfort me" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
