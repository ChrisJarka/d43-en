\v 8 I have heard the taunts of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon when they taunted my people and encroached
against their border. [[I opted for "encroached" here since a military build-up is an obvious encroachment in preparation for war.]]
\v 9 Therefore, as I live--This is Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel's declaration--Moab shall become like Sodom, and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah; a weedy place and a saltpit, deserted forevermore! But the remnant of my people will plunder them, and the remainder of my nation will inherit them!
