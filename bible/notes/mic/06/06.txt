\v 6 Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings,
with calves a year old?
\v 7 will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my
firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
\v 8 He has showed thee, O man, what is good; and what does Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness,
and to walk humbly with your God?
