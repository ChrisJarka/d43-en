\c 115
\q
\v 1 Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us,
\q But to your name give glory,
\q For your lovingkindness, and for your truth’s sake.
\q
\v 2 Wherefore should the nations say,
\q Where is now their God?
\q
\v 3 But our God is in the heavens:
\q He has done whatever he pleased.
\q
\v 4 Their idols are silver and gold,
\q The work of men’s hands.
\q
\v 5 They have mouths, but they speak not;
\q Eyes have they, but they see not;
\q
\v 6 They have ears, but they hear not;
\q Noses have they, but they smell not;
\q
\v 7 They have hands, but they handle not;
\q Feet have they, but they walk not;
\q Neither speak they through their throat.
\q
\v 8 They that make them shall be like to them;
\q Yea, every one that trusts in them.
\q
\v 9 O Israel, trust you in Jehovah:
\q He is their help and their shield.
\q
\v 10 O house of Aaron, trust you in Jehovah:
\q He is their help and their shield.
\q
\v 11 You that fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah:
\q He is their help and their shield.
\q
\v 12 Jehovah has been mindful of us; he will bless us:
\q He will bless the house of Israel;
\q He will bless the house of Aaron.
\q
\v 13 He will bless them that fear Jehovah,
\q Both small and great.
\q
\v 14 Jehovah increase you more and more,
\q You and your children.
\q
\v 15 Blessed are you of Jehovah,
\q Who made heaven and earth.
\q
\v 16 The heavens are the heavens of Jehovah;
\q But the earth has he given to the children of men.
\q
\v 17 The dead praise not Jehovah,
\q Neither any that go down into silence;
\q
\v 18 But we will bless Jehovah
\q From this time forth and for evermore.
\q Praise you Jehovah.
