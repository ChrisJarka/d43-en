===== translationNotes: =====

  * **David assembled all Israel together** - Here the word "all" is a generalization. The phrase means that David assembled people from all over Israel, not that he assembled every person in Israel. AT: "David assembled people together from all Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
  * **Lebo Hamath ... Kiriath Jearim ... Baalah** - These are the names of places. "Baalah" is another name for Kiriath Jearim. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **which belongs to Judah** - "which is in Judah"
  * **to bring up from there the ark of God** - It is implied that they are taking the ark to Jerusalem. AT: "to take to Jerusalem the ark of God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **to bring up from there** - Jerusalem is higher than almost any other place in Israel, so it was normal for Israelites to speak of going up to Jerusalem and going down from it.
  * **which is called by Yahweh's name** - This can be stated in active form. Possible meanings are 1) the idiom "called by ... name" refers to a person owning the thing. AT: "which belongs to Yahweh" or 2) the ark has Yahweh's name written on it. AT: "which bears Yahweh's name" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **who sits enthroned over the cherubim** - AT: "who rules from between the statues of winged creatures on the ark of the covenant" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
