\v 25 But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that while you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* were alive \add on earth\add* you enjoyed \add many\add* good things. But Lazarus was miserable. Now \add it is fair that\add* he is happy here, and you are suffering.
\v 26 Besides that, there is a huge ravine between you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* and us. So those who want to go from here to where you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are, are not able to. Furthermore, no one can cross from there to where we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are.'

\v 25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and you are in anguish.
\v 26 And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from here to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from there to us.
