\v 4 \add I will explain why it is important to do that. Some\add* people have at one time fully understood \add the message about Christ\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. They have experienced \add a relationship with Jesus Christ\add* that God [EUP\f + \ft Or: MTY \f*] gave \add to them\add*. They have received the Holy Spirit the same as \add others have\add*.
\v 5 They have experienced that God's message is good. And by what they have experienced \add now\add*, they know how \add God will work\add* powerfully in the future.

\v 4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and who shared in the Holy Spirit,
\v 5 and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,
\v 6 and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; because they would be crucifying the Son of God again, and making him an object of public ridicule.
