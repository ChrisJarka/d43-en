====== 2 Corinthians 05 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

**Our expectation of new bodies in heaven**

Because Paul knows that when he dies he will receive a much better body, he is not afraid of being killed for preaching the Good News. So he tells others that they too can be reconciled to God. Christ will take their sin away and give them his righteousness. They become different people no longer blamed for their sins.


=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

**Metaphor**

The first paragraph of this chapter, talking about the new bodies God will give us in heaven, uses many [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]s:  "the earthly dwelling" and "tent" both mean our body here on earth, "building from God" and  "our heavenly dwelling" both mean the body God will give us when we are resurrected. "clothed" means with a body, "naked" means without a body. "what is mortal may be swallowed up by life" means our bodies that die will be changed to bodies that live forever. 

**Idiom:**

Paul uses a pair of [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]s: "out of our minds" which means insane/mad and "in our right minds" which means sane/not mad.
