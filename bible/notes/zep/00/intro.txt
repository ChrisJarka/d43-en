=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "Zephaniah" may also be called the "The book about Zephaniah" or "The sayings of Zephaniah."

=== Who wrote Zephaniah? ===

Zephaniah is the author of this book, but there are 4 Zephaniah's mentioned in the Old Testament. This Zephaniah was the great-grandson of King Hezekiah and the cousin to King Josiah (who lived at the same time as Zephaniah). This would have made him royalty. Zephaniah lived in the city of Jerusalem. Zephaniah began his ministry about 70 years after the prophets Isaiah and Micah. Zephaniah’s ministry was during the reign of King Josiah (about 640-621 BC), and just before the ministry of the prophet Jeremiah. And following Zephaniah there came the prophets Jeremiah, Habakkuk, Obadiah, Ezekiel and Nahum.



===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
=== Did the prophecies of Zephaniah occur before Josiah's reforms? ===

Josiah was one of the most important kings of Judah because of the great religious reforms he began. These reforms led the people back to Yahweh. It is probable that Zephaniah's wrote this book prior to the Josiah's reforms.

=== What was the religious environment of Judah during Zephaniah's ministry? ===

Manasseh was one of the worst kings of Judah and reigned for 50 years. He encouraged the people to worship other [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]] who the Canaanite people worshipped. The people of Judah did not have a proper relationship with Yahweh.
