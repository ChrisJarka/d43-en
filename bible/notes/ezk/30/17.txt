===== Translation Notes: =====

Yahweh continues to describe how he will punish Egypt.
  * **vigorous** - "young and strong"
  * ** Heliopolis** - This was a city in northern Egypt. It was a few miles northeast of where Cairo is today. (See: [[en:ta:translate:translatenames]]) 
  * **Bubastis** – This was a city in Egypt.
  * **will fall by the sword** - Swords were one of the most important weapons in a battle or war, so "sword" is used to refer to "battle" or "war." Alternate translation: "will die in battle" or "will die in the war." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **they will walk in captivity** - "the people of these cities will become captives" or "the enemy will take the people of the people of these cities away as prisoners"
  * **Tehaphnehes** - Tehaphnehes was an important city in Egypt.
  * **in Tehaphnehes the day will hold back** - "the day will not come." This phrase compares the disaster that happens to Tehaphnehes with a day on which the sun does not rise. This shows that the disaster is very scary and bad. Alternate translation: "I will destroy Tehaphnehes in a scary and awful way." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **when I break the yoke of Egypt there** This expression means "When I destroy Tehphnhes, Egypt will no longer have control over other nations." (See: [[en:ta:translate:idiom]])
  * **and the pride of her strength will be finished** – "Egypt will will not be proud of being strong anymore" or "that country will no longer be proud of being strong" (UDB)
  * **There will be a cloud covering her** - "A cloud will be over Egypt. This expression probably means 1) "Egypt will be very sad" or 2) "Egypt will be ruined."
  * **her daughters will walk in captivity** - Possible meanings are: 1) "I will take the daughters of Egypt away as prisoners" or 2) "the people of the towns of Egypt will become prisoners"
  * **I will execute judgment in Egypt** - "I will punish Egypt in many ways"
  * **so they** - "so the Egyptians"
  * **will know that I am Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:06:06|6:7]].
