=== What is the Book of 2 Corinthians about? ===

2 Thessalonians was written by Paul shortly after 1 Thessalonians. Paul was still in Corinth, and he was with Silas and Timothy. This letter seems to be written because of new information about events that were affecting the church in Thessalonica. 2 Thess. 2:2 implies that there was a false letter written in the name of Paul that was received by the church in Thessalonica, and that the teaching in that letter led to some confusion. You will note that Paul signs his own signature at the end of the letter, to ensure the validity of this letter.
 
There were two main themes in 2 Thessalonians. The first matter is the confusion that arose about the Second Coming, called the “Parousia” or the “arrival” of Jesus Christ. Some had said that Christ had already come back to earth from heaven, and that the Christians in Thessalonica had been excluded (in some ways) from the promise of the return of Christ. This led to considerable confusion, not only about the future of Christ's return, but about the condition of those Christians who had already died. The second matter Paul addresses was the issue of idleness, or laziness (see 3:6-15). Paul reminded them of the diligence and hard work that he and his associates demonstrated before them. Whatever the cause for the laziness or “idleness” of some, Paul teaches them, “If one is unwilling to work, let them not eat.”

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Thessalonians” or "Second Thessalonians." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul's Second Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The First Letter to the Christians in Thessalonica.” It is possible that 2 Thessalonians may have been written prior to 1 Thessalonians.

=== Who wrote the Book of 2 Thessalonians? ===

This book is the second letter Paul wrote to church in Thessalonica. Paul was also known as “Saul” when he was a Pharisee and a persecutor of the church before his conversion to faith in Christ. He was a scholar in the Jewish law, but he became a Christian and an apostle of Jesus Christ.

=== What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Thessalonians? ===

The text of some English translations do not agree concerning what to include. This is because of the discovery of manuscripts that many believe are more accurate. The follow are the most significant issues in the Book of 2 Thessalonians:

  * Some manuscripts say "lawlessness" (ULB) while others say "sin very greatly" (UDB) (2:7) 
  * Some manuscripts say "first fruits" (ULB) while others say "first people" or "from the beginning" (2:13)

Translators are advised to translate this passage following the ULB. However, if older Bible versions exist in their region using other words, it is not wrong to translate them using these other terms.
