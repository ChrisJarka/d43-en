\v 3 \add Early\add* in the morning \add you say\add*, 'It will be stormy weather today, because the sky is red, and dark clouds have formed.' You understand how to predict \add the weather by looking at the sky\add*, but you cannot \add seem to look at what is happening\add* now\add and by that\add* understand \add what God is doing\add*.
\v 4 \add You\add* evil people have seen me\add perform miracles\add* but you do not faithfully worship God \f + \ft metaphor \f*. You want to see \add me perform\add* a miracle \add that would prove that God has sent me\add*. But \add God\add* will \add enable you to see\add* only one miracle. It will be \add like\add* what happened \f + \ft metaphor \f* to Jonah, \add the prophet, who was inside a huge fish for three days and then came out of it to live again\add*." Then Jesus left them and sailed away, \add along with us disciples\add*.

\v 3 But if the sky is read in the morning we say, 'It will be stormy weather today.' By looking at the sky, you can tell what the weather will be, but when you see the things that are now happening all around you, you do not understand what God is doing.
\v 4 You evil people have seen me perform miracles, but you do not faithfully worship God. So I will do no miracle for you, except the miracle that happened to Jonah the prophet, who spent three days inside a huge fish but came out again." Then Jesus left them and sailed away, along with his disciples.

\v 3 And in the morning you say, 'It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and lowering.' You know how to interpret 
the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.
\v 4 An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but  no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah."
Then Jesus left them and went away.

It is a continuation of Jesus' reply to the Pharisees and Sadducees.

  * **And in the morning**  - This is the time of day when the sun is rising.
  * foul weather - cloudy and stormy
  * **lowering**  - gloomy, or overcast.
  * **You know how**  - "You" is a plural pronoun that refers to the Pharisees and Sadducees.
  * **the signs of the times**  - This could be translated as "the things that are now happening all around you." Just as Jesus knew they could read the weather, he was expecting them to read what God was doing around them. (UDB)
  * **given to it**  - The word **it**  refers to "the evil and adulterous generation."
  * **sign of Jonah **- This refers to the Old Testament prophet Jonah that spent three days in a huge fish, then God delivered him from the fish. (See metaphor)
