\q2 I am very grieved within my inner being.
\q1 Because very many of my people have died,
\q2 in my inner being I grieve and am exhausted.

\q
\v 11 My eyes have failed from their tears; my stomach churns;  
\q my inner parts are poured out to the ground because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,
\q children and infants faint in the streets of the city. 
\q
\v 12 They say to their mothers, "Where is grain and wine?"
\q as they faint like a wounded man in the streets of the city,
\q their lives are poured out on the bosom of their mothers.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The author shifts from describing Jerusalem to describing his own experience.

  * **My eyes have failed from their tears** - This is an idiom. AT: "I have cried until I cannot cry anymore" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **my stomach churns** - The word "churn" means to move around violently, normally in a circular rotation. This does not mean the stomach is literally churning, but describes how the woman, representing Jerusalem, feels. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:lam:01:20|1:20]]. AT: "my insides ache" or "my stomach hurts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **my inner parts are poured out to the ground** - The author speaks of feeling grief in his inner being as if his inner body parts had fallen out of his body onto the ground. AT: "my entire inner being is in grief" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **the daughter of my people** - This is a poetic name of Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. AT: "my people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification|Personification]])
  * **Where is grain and wine?** - This rhetorical question is used as a request for something to eat. The children are telling their mother that they are hungry. The phrase "grain and wine" represents food and drink. This question may be written as a statement. AT: "Give us something to eat and drink." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **as they faint like a wounded man** - This speaks of the children fainting from hunger and thirst in the same way that a wounded man faints. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **their lives are poured out on the bosom of their mothers** - This speaks of the children dying as if their lives were a liquid that was being poured out. AT: "they slowly die in the arms of their mothers" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
