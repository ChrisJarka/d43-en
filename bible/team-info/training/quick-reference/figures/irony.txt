====== Irony ======

===== Description =====

Irony is using words to say the opposite of what you mean. Irony is typically used to be humorous or to place emphasis on the differences in something. In irony, sometimes a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it.
