===== Style and Level =====

The questions of this section will help the wider church leadership determine if the book is translated in a style and at a level that is appropriate and acceptable to the audience.

Q? Which of the following statements best describes the style of your translation?

- Word by word translation, staying close to the form of the reference or national language translation

- Phrase by phrase translation, using natural language phrase structures

- Meaning-focused translation, aiming for a freedom of local language expression

(All of these translation philosophies are acceptable, but it is good to know how the team translated. Has the team been consistent with both accuracy and local comprehension?)

Q? How have the church members in your community responded to the translation? Is it appropriate and acceptable speech?  (Is the manner of speaking appropriate for the local audience?)

Q? Does the community feel that the dialect that the writer used was an appropriate form of the language acceptable to the wider language community?  (Is the writer familiar with the dialects of your language found throughout the area? Has the writer used expressions, phrase connectors and spellings that will be recognized by a broad section of the language community?)
