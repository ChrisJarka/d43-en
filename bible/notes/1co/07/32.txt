\v 32 I want you to be free from worries. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. 
\v 33 But the married man is concerned for the things of the world, and how to please his wife;
\v 34 his interests are divided. So also the unmarried or the virgin is concerned for the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and in spirit. But the married woman is also concerned about the things of the world and how to please her husband.
