\v 13 Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
\v 14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
\v 15 And if you deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in your sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
