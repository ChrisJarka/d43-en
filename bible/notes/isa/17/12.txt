\q2 when Yahweh rebukes them, they will run far away.
\q1 They will flee like \f + \ft simile \f* chaff on the hills scatters when the wind \add blows\add*,
\q2 like tumbleweeds scatter when a windstorm blows.

\v 12 Listen, the uproar of many peoples, that roar like the roaring of the seas, and the rushing of nations, that rush like the
rushing of mighty waters!
\v 13 The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters, but he will rebuke them. They will flee and will be chased as the dead weeds on the mountains before the wind, and like the whirling dust before the storm.
\v 14 In the evening, behold, terror; and before the morning they are gone, the lot of them that rob us.
