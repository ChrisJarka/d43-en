===== Explicit and Implicit Information =====

This module answers the question: How do I make implicit information explicit?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit]]

Translators need to be particularly sensitive when information is not stated explicitly. If something is intentionally unclear in the text, keep it unclear in the translation. The translation should always have the same meaning as the source text.

So, what if there is implied information that would lead the reader to either an unclear or incorrect understanding of the original message? Is it okay to make it more explicit? The translator always wants to make sure the reader understands the original meaning of the message. This may mean the translation may have additional information included to make the meaning clear. Some languages may need to add an object where English (or whatever source language is being used) doesn't have one.

Implied information may be made explicit for clarification purposes if:
  * Only the implied information in the original message is made explicit,
  * No new information is added
  * It is necessary in order to communicate the main point of the message,
  * No meaning, or a wrong meaning would be communicated without the added information
  * It does not change the meaning so it is no longer true or accurate
  * or it is suitable to the original situation in which the message was given.
As always, you need to ask yourself if your translation is communicating accurately what the original message was saying.

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Genesis 11:5 ** //So Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower which the descendants of Adam had built.//
 
The phrase "came down" refers to **where** he came from. The place is understood by the reader. Name the place to make the information explicit as in: //So Yahweh came down **from heaven** to see the city and the tower which the descendants of Adam had built.//

**Genesis 14:3** //These latter five kings joined together in the valley of Siddim (also called the Salt Sea).//
 
The information that the armies were with these five kings is understood by the reader. The information that their armies were with them can be made explicit: “These latter five kings and their armies joined together.” 

**Genesis 4:18** //To Enoch was born Irad.//
 
It is understood that Enoch had a son and named him Irad or that Enoch became the father of Irad. The implied information is that Enoch grew up and married a woman and had a son.
 
===== Examples from English =====
  * David asks Susan: “Where is Joe?” David’s question is explicit because it is clearly stated and easily understood by Susan.
  * Susan answers, “At work.” Susan’s response is implicit but David understands her message is in fact “Joe is at work.”
