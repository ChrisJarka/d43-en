\v 9 Because of all that, we always want to please Jesus in everything that we do. Whether we are still living here in these bodies or whether we have left them and are living in our home in heaven, we want to please him.
\v 10 And we need to try hard to do that because each one of us believers must stand before Christ to be judged by him . At that time he will reward each one of us according to what we have done while we lived in this world in these bodies. He will reward us according to whether we have done good or whether we have done evil.
