====== Genesis 12 General Notes ======


=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Abram ==
When God said, "Go from your country, and from your relatives," he established several new people groups. These groups descended from Abram. 

== God's covenant with Abraham ==
God made a [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenant]] with Abram. This covenant was not conditioned upon anything that Abraham needed to do, but the fulfillment of its promises is conditioned upon the actions of each generation of his descendants. It has not yet been fulfilled in its entirety. 

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== "They will kill me" ==
Abram was afraid that the Egyptians would see him as a foreigner and when they saw his beautiful wife, they would try to kill him. This was would free Sarai to marry someone else. Apparently, it would have been easy for them to kill a foreigner without punishment. If she was Abram's sister, they would have shown favor to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
