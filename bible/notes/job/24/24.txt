\q1
\v 25 If this is not true, is there \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* anyone who will show that I am a liar
\q2 and prove that what I have said is not true?"

<usfm>
\q
\v 24 They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone;
\q Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others,
\q And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.
\q
\v 25 And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar,
\q And make my speech nothing worth?
