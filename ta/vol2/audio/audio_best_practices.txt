===== Best Practices =====

//This page answers the question:// //What are best practices for audio?//

In this manual we strive to identify the best approaches, standards, methods and techniques that show the most effectiveness, reliability, affordability and sustainability in the diverse challenges of the real-world context. However, these aspects are not the ultimate goal or purpose of audio recording. The ultimate goal is to worship God and make His message known to everyone.

Therefore, best practices are not such unless they are aligned for the worship of God, are bringing His family together in love and unity, and are confirmed to be yielding audio resources with the best possible value and meaningful blessing to the people in need of them.
