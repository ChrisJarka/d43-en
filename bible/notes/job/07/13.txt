====== Job 07:13-15 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 When I \add lie down at night\add*, I say \add to myself\add*, 'I will be comforted here on my bed;
\q2 my pain will be less while I am sleeping.'
\q1
\v 14 But then you give me dreams that cause me to be afraid;
\q2 you give me visions that terrify me,
\q1
\v 15 with the result that I would prefer to die because of being strangled
\q2 than to continue to \add be alive\add* being only a bunch of bones.
\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 13 When I say, My bed shall comfort me,
\q My couch shall ease my complaint;
\q
\v 14 Then you scare me with dreams,
\q And terrifiest me through visions:
\q
\v 15 So that my soul chooses strangling,
\q And death rather than these my bones.
