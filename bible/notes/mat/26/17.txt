\v 17 On the first day of the week-long Festival of Bread with no Yeast, we disciples went to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the meal for the Passover celebration so that we can eat it with you?"
\v 18 Jesus instructed two of the disciples about what they should do. He said to them, "Go into the city to a man with whom I have previously arranged this. Tell him this: 'The Teacher says, "The time that I told you about is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover meal with my disciples at your house, and I have sent these two to prepare the meal."'"
\v 19 So the two disciples did as Jesus told them. They went and prepared the Passover meal in that man's house.
