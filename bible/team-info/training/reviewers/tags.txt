====== Tag Combinations ======

The status tags are what cause the chunks to appear in the workflow of the correct person. These "status" tags are:

  * create
  * draft
  * check
  * review
  * text
  * discuss
  * inspect
  * publish


==== "Text" tag ====

“publish text” - there is a minor UDB issue, but notes are done. I will fix UDB and leave published.
“review text” - there is a text issue that is putting review on hold. I will fix text and leave as “review” so notes can be finished.
“text” - The notes are done, but the chunk is not published due to a ULB text issue. I will fix the text, check the notes, and publish. 
“text discuss” - There is both a text issue and a larger problem in the notes. I will fix the text, and then tackle the other issue. I will publish when done.


==== "Discuss" tag ====
