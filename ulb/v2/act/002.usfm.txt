\v 1 And when the day of Pentecost was now come, they were all together in one place.
\v 2 And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they
were sitting.
\v 3 And there appeared to them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them.
\v 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
\p
\v 5 Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.
\v 6 And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them
speaking in his own language.
\v 7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilaeans?
\v 8 And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born?
\v 9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,
\v 10 in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and
proselytes,
\v 11 Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God.
\v 12 And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this?
\v 13 But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine.
\p
\v 14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke forth to them,
saying, You men of Judaea, and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and give ear to my words.
\v 15 For these are not drunken, as you suppose; seeing it is but
the third hour of the day;
\v 16 but this is that which has been spoken through the prophet Joel:
\q
\v 17 And it shall be in the last days, says God,
\q I will pour forth of my Spirit upon all flesh:
\q And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
\q And your young men shall see visions,
\q And your old men shall dream dreams:
\q
\v 18 Yes and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days
\q Will I pour forth of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.
\q
\v 19 And I will show wonders in the heaven above,
\q And signs on the earth beneath;
\q Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:
\q
\v 20 The sun shall be turned into darkness,
\q And the moon into blood,
\q Before the day of the Lord come,
\q That great and notable day:
\q
\v 21 And it shall be, that whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
\m
\v 22 You men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God to you by mighty works and wonders and
signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know;
\v 23 him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you by the hand of lawless men did crucify
and slay:
\v 24 whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
\v 25 For David says concerning him,
\q I [*]saw the Lord always before my face;
\q For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
\q
\v 26 Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;
\q Moreover my flesh also shall dwell in hope:
\q
\v 27 Because you will not leave my soul to Hades,
\q Neither will you give your Holy One to see corruption.
\q
\v 28 You made known to me the ways of life;
\q You shall make me full of gladness with your countenance.
\m
\v 29 Brethren, I may say to you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us
to this day.
\v 30 Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he would
set one upon his throne;
\v 31 he foreseeing this spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left to Hades, nor did his
flesh see corruption.
\v 32 This Jesus did God raise up, whereof we all are witnesses.
\v 33 Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he
has poured forth this, which you see and hear.
\v 34 For David ascended not into the heavens: but he says himself,
\q The Lord said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand,
\q
\v 35 Till I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.
\m
\v 36 Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you
crucified.
\p
\v 37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles,
Brethren, what shall we do?
\v 38 And Peter said to them, Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ to the
remission of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\v 39 For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all that are afar off,
even as many as the Lord our God shall call to him.
\v 40 And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.
\v 41 They then that received his word were baptized: and there were added
to them in that day about three thousand souls.
\v 42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostlesâ€™ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.
\p
\v 43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.
\v 44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
\v 45 and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need.
\v 46 And day by day, continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food
with gladness and singleness of heart,
\v 47 praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to them day by day those that were saved.
