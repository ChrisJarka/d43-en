\v 17 \add Disregard such people\add* because those \add regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* about food and drink and festivals\add* are \add only\add* like a shadow \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that is cast by something that is approaching; that is, they merely represent\add* the real spiritual blessings that Christ \add has given to you\add*.

\v 16 So disregard anyone who says that God will punish you because you eat certain foods and drink certain drinks or because you do not celebrate special yearly festivals or when the new moon appears or weekly Sabbaths.
\v 17 These kinds of rules and events only picture what is truly  coming. What is truly coming is Christ himself.

\v 16 So then, let no one judge you in eating or in drinking, or about a feast day or a new moon, or about Sabbath days.
\v 17 These are a shadow of the things to come, but the reality is Christ.
