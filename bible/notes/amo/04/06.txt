\v 6 I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities
\q and lack of bread in all your places.
\q Yet you have not returned to me
\q â€”this is Yahweh's declaration.
\q
\v 7 I also withheld rain from you
\q when there were still three months to the harvest.
\q I caused it to rain on one city,
\q and caused it not to rain on another city.
\q One piece of land was rained on,
\q but the piece of land where it did not rain dried up.
