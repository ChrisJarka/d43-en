\v 15 Then the Lord replied to him, "You\add \f + \ft singular \f* and your fellow religious leaders are\add* hypocrites!

\v 16 This woman \add is more important than an animal; she is a Jew\add*, descended from Abraham!

\v 15 Then the Lord replied to him, "You and your fellow religious leaders are hypocrites! Each of you works on the Jewish day of rest too! Would you not untie your ox or donkey to lead it from the food trough to where it can drink water?
\v 16 This woman is a Jew, descended from Abraham! But Satan has kept her crippled for eighteen years, as though he had tied her up! Certainly you would agree that it is right that I free her from Satan, even if this is a day of rest!

\v 15 But the Lord answered him and said, "Hypocrites! Do not each of you untie your donkey or cow from its stall and lead it to drink on the Sabbath?
\v 16 So too, this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, is it not necessary to untie her from her bonds on the Sabbath?"
