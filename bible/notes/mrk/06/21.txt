\v 21 But a day came that was an opportunity for Herodias to act: on his birthday Herod made a dinner for his officials, his commanders, and the leaders of Galilee.
\v 22 The daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced for them, and she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you."
\v 23 He swore to her saying, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."
\v 24 She went out and said to her mother, "What should I ask him for?" She said, "The head of John the Baptizer."
\v 25 She hurried back in the hall to the king and asked him, "I want you to give me at once, upon a platter, the head of John the Baptizer."
