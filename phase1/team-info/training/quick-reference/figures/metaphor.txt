====== Metaphor ======


===== Description =====

A metaphor is a figure of speech that creates a 'word picture' by relating one thing (the topic of the metaphor) to an unrelated object. Metaphors imply (or state directly) that the two things have something in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words 'like' and 'as' are not used to show it. A metaphor transfers an image from one familiar object to another object that is less easily understood.

===== Bible Examples =====

Field reference numbers are included for clarity purposes only. They are omitted in the actual note.

=== Acts 7:39 ===

"This is the man whom our forefathers refused to obey; they pushed him away from themselves, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt."

  * ** (1) pushed him away from themselves** - **(3)** This phrase compares how the Israelites rejected Moses to how people might shove away someone they do not like. **(4)** AT: "they rejected him as their leader" (UDB). **(5)** (See: Metaphor)

=== 1 Timothy 1:2 ===

"To Timothy, a true son in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. "

  * **(1) true son ** - **â€‹(2)** "real son." **(3)** This phrase compares the close relationship between Timothy and Paul to that of a father and a son. Timothy was not Paul's actual son, but he gave Paul the same level of honor, obedience, and service that any son could give his father. **(4)** AT: "You are like a real son to me"  **(5)** (See: Metaphor)
