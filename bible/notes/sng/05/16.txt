===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The young woman continues to describe the man.

  * **His mouth is most sweet** - The mouth is a metonym for either 1) the man's sweet kisses or 2) the sweet words that he says. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **he is completely lovely** - "every part of him is lovely" or "all of him is lovely"
  * **This is my beloved, and this is my friend** - The word "This" refers to the man that the woman has just finished describing. You could also translate this phrase as "That is what the one I love is like, and that is what my friend is like."
  * **beloved** - Some versions such as the UDB understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13]].
  * **daughters of Jerusalem** - "young women of Jerusalem." These young women could not hear her and were not present, but the woman speaks as if they were present and could hear her. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:07|2:7]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
