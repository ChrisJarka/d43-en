\v 26 But the woman whose baby was alive greatly loved her baby, so she said to the king, "No, Your Majesty! Do not allow him to kill the baby! Give her the child that is alive!" But the other woman said to the king, "No, cut it in half. Then it will not be her baby or my baby."
\p
\v 27 Then the king said to the servant, "Do not kill the baby. Give the baby to the woman who said 'Do not cut the baby in half,' because she is truly the baby's mother."
\p
\v 28 All the Israelite people heard about what the king had decided, and they had an awesome respect for him. They realized that God had truly enabled him to be very wise, to judge people's matters fairly.

\v 26 Then spoke the woman whose the living child was to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my
lord, give her the living child, and in no wise kill it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.
\v 27 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise kill it: she is the mother thereof.
\v 28 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of
God was in him, to do justice.
