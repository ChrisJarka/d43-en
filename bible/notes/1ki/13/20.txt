\v 20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of Jehovah came to the prophet that brought him back;
\v 21 and he cried to the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Forasmuch as you have been
disobedient to the mouth of Jehovah, and have not kept the commandment which Jehovah your God commanded thee,
\v 22 but came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no
water; your body shall not come to the sepulchre of your fathers.
