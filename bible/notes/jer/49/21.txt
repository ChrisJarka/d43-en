\v 21 At the sound of their falling the earth shakes. The sound of distressed shouts is heard at the Sea of Reeds.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **At the sound of their falling the earth shakes** - The loud sound of Edom being destroyed is spoken of as if Edom were a large object that shakes the earth when it falls. AT: "When enemies come and destroy Edom, the noise will be extremely loud, with the result that the earth will shake" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The sound of distressed shouts is heard at the Sea of Reeds** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "People at the Sea of Reeds will hear the people of Edom crying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **See** - "Look" or "Listen"
  * **someone will attack like an eagle, and swoop down and spread his wings** - This simile means that when the enemy army attacks it will be vicious and unexpected. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **Bozrah** - Translate the name of this city as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:48:21|48:24]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the hearts of Edom's soldiers will become like the heart of a woman in birth labor** - Here "hearts" represent a person's emotions. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:48:40|48:41]]. AT: "Edom's soldiers will be afraid like a woman about to give birth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
