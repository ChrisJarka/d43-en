Here is what Tim Jore wrote about the original process - when there was only 1 source text for the translators. Can we use some or all of it?

That is the visualization that Larry, Christine, and I sketched out in our last meeting. Essentially, it suggests that the “literal <-> dynamic” spectrum is actually two perpendicular spectra (lexical, syntactical) that form a 2-dimensional grid. What I believe we are aiming for with the unfoldingWord Translator’s Bible is an English text that is quite dynamic on the syntactical spectrum (closer to a NLT) yet quite literal on the lexical spectrum, with regard to key theological terms (e.g. “justification”, “atonement”, etc.). These terms would be explained in great detail in the translation notes.


To my knowledge, such a translation does not yet exist, as most tend to be “all literal” (words and grammar) or “all dynamic”. Our assumption, based on recent experience, is that moving an existing translation from “literal -> dynamic”is more easily accomplished along the syntactical spectrum than the lexical. That is, we are finding it is difficult to adjust lexical choices of the TFT to more closely align with our needs in the UTB. The assumption is that it will be easier to adjust a translation like the NET to be more syntactically dynamic, with key theological words intact.
