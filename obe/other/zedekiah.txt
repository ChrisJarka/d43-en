Zedekiah was the last King of Judah (597-587 B.C.).  He was twenty-one years old when he took the throne after Nebuchadrezzer had deported most of the royalty to Babylon.  He consulted with Jeremiah and Ezekiel but was an ineffective leader.  He was captured after the seige of Jerusalem, brought before the king of Babylon and sentenced to watch his sons slain after which he was blinded.
