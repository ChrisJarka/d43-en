====== 1 Samuel 06:5-6 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Make models that represent the rats and the tumors that are ruining your land. Make them in order to honor the god of the Israelite people. If you do that, perhaps he will stop punishing [IDI] you, and your gods, and your land.
\v 6 Do not be \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* stubborn [IDI] like the Egyptians and their king were. \add They did not do what their god told them to do, so he punished them\add*. After their god finished punishing them very severely, they were glad to allow the Israelites to leave their country \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 Make models that represent the rats and the tumors that are ruining your land. Make them in order to honor the god of the Israelite people. If you do that, perhaps Yahweh will stop punishing you, your gods, and your land.
\v 6 Do not be stubborn as Pharaoh and the Egyptians were. Remember that Yahweh finally made them suffer more than they could bear, and that they finally allowed the Israelites to leave their land.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 So you must make models of your tumors, and models of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you, from your gods, and from your land.
\v 6 Why should you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? That was when the God of Israel dealt severely with them; did not the Egyptians send away the people, and they left?

  * **model** - A model is a copy of a real thing.
  * **that ravage** - "that are destroying"
  * **lift his hand from you, from your gods, and from your land** - Here "hand" is a metonym used to represent God's power to afflict or discipline. AT: "stop punishing you, your gods and your land" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Why should you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts?** - The priests and diviners use a rhetorical question to urge the Philistines to think very seriously about what will happen if they refuse to obey God. This can be translated as a warning. AT: "Do not be stubborn like the Egyptians and Pharaoh were!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **harden your hearts** - This is an idiom that means to be stubborn or unwilling to obey God. AT: "refuse to obey God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **did not the Egyptians send away the people, and they left?** - This is another rhetorical question used to remind the Philistines how the Egyptians finally sent the Israelites out of Egypt so that God would stop afflicting them. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "remember that the Egyptians sent the Israelites out of Egypt." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
