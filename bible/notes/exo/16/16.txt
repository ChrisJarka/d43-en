\v 16 This is the thing that Yahweh has commanded, 'Gather you of it every man according to how much he needs to eat: an omer per person, according to the number of your personsâ€”this is how you will gather it, every man for those who are in his tent.'"
\v 17 The people of Israel did so. Some gathered more, some gathered less.
\v 18 When they measured it with an omer, he who had gathered much had nothing over, and he who had gathered little had no lack. They gathered each one according to his need.
