===== Definition: =====

A "gate" is a hinged barrier at an access point in a fence or defensive wall, like a city wall in biblical times.

  * A gate in a city wall could be opened to allow people, animals, and cargo to travel in and out of the city, and could be closed to prevent enemy soldiers and other undesirables from entering.
  * A gate was often the place that served as the news and social center of a village.
  * Reading Ruth 4 shows that at least some business transactions occurred at the gate.
