===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 This word is worthy of trust. If someone very much desires to be an overseer, he desires excellent work.
\v 2 For that reason, however, the overseer must be free from any claims against him, the husband of one wife, moderate in all things, balanced in his thinking, well-ordered, and a friend to strangers. He should be able and willing to teach others.
\v 3 He must not be an alcoholic, not quick to fight, not greedy, but instead, he should be willing to let other people have their own way and not always try to get his own way. He should not be quick to argue and not be a man who loves money.

\v 1 This saying is trustworthy: If someone desires to be an overseer, he desires a good work.
\v 2 Therefore the overseer must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, moderate, sensible, orderly, hospitable, able to teach,
\v 3 not an alcoholic, not quick to fight, but instead, gentle, peaceful , not a lover of money.
