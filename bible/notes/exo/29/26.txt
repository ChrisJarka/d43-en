\v 26 You will take the breast of Aaronâ€™s ram of consecration  and raise it up as an offering to Yahweh. Then it will be your portion to eat.
\v 27 You will consecrate the breast of the raised offering and the thigh of the presented offering--the breast that is raised and the thigh that is presented, both coming from the ram of consecration of Aaron and his sons.
\v 28 These will be the portions forever for Aaron and his sons from the Israelites. By the regulations for the fellowship offerings, these will be a perpetual contribution to the priests, taken from the Israelites' contributions made to Yahweh.
