\v 10 For the priests, there will be a strip of land 8.3 miles\f + \ft Or: 13.3 km. \f* wide and 3.3 miles\f + \ft Or: 5.3 km. \f* wide, with the temple in the center.
\v 11 That area is for the priests who are descendants of Zadok. They are ones who served me faithfully and did not turn away from Yahweh like most of the descendants of Levi and the other Israelite people did.
\v 12 When the land is distributed, that area will be the priests' special portion, land that is very sacred. Next to the priests' territory will be where the other descendants of Levi will live.

\v 10 And for these, even for the priests, shall be the holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand
in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the
south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in the midst thereof.
\v 11 It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, that have kept my charge, that went not
astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
\v 12 And it shall be to them an oblation from the oblation of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites.
