\v 43 For the days shall come upon you, when your enemies shall cast up a bank about you, and compass you round, and keep you in on every side,
\v 44 and shall dash you to the ground, and your children within you; and they shall not leave in you one stone upon another; because you knew not the time of your visitation.
