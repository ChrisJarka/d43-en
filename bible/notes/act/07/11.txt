\v 11 While Joseph was doing that work, there was a time when there was very little food in Egypt and also in Canaan. People were suffering. At that time Jacob and his sons in Canaan also could not find enough food.
\v 12 When Jacob heard people report that there was grain that people could buy in Egypt, he sent Joseph's older brothers to go there to buy grain. They went and bought grain from Joseph, but they did not recognize him. Then they returned home.
\v 13 When Joseph's brothers went to Egypt the second time, they again bought grain from Joseph. But this time he told them who he was. And so Pharaoh learned that Joseph's people were Hebrews and that those men who had come from Canaan were his brothers.

\v 11 Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan and great suffering: and our fathers found no food.
\v 12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers the first time.
\v 13 At the second time Joseph showed himself to his brothers; and Josephâ€™s family became known to Pharaoh.
