Translators can best use the ULB and UDB by remembering the following differences between the ULB and UDB and knowing how the target language deals with these issues.

====Order of Ideas==== 

The ULB tries to present ideas **in the same order** as they appear in the source text. \\
The UDB tries to present ideas in an order that is more natural in English.
 
As a translator, you should put ideas into an order that is natural in the project language. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_events]])

> <sup>1</sup>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, and set apart for the gospel of God...<sup>7</sup>This letter is to all who are in Rome, the beloved of God. (Romans 1:1,7 ULB)

><sup>1</sup>I, Paul, who serve Christ Jesus, am writing this letter to all of you believers in the city of Rome. (Romans 1:1 UDB) 

The ULB shows Paul's style of beginning his letters. He does not say who his audience is until verse 7. However, the UDB follows a style that is much more natural in English and most other languages today.

==== Implied Information====
The ULB often presents ideas that only **imply** other ideas.\\
The UDB often makes those other ideas explicit.

As a translator, you should decide which implied ideas will be understood by your audience. You probably do not need to make implied ideas explicit in your translation if your audience understands them without too much effort. Remember also that you might offend your audience if you needlessly present implied ideas that they would understand anyway. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])

>And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid, because from now on you will catch men." (Luke 5:10 ULB) 

> But Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid! Until now you gathered in fish, but from now on you will gather in people to become my disciples." (Luke 5:10 UDB)

Here the UDB reminds the reader that Simon was a fisherman by trade. It also make clear the similarity that Jesus was drawing between Simon's previous work and his future work.
In addition, the UDB makes it clear why Jesus wanted Simon to "catch men" (ULB): "to become my disciples" (UDB).

> When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." (Luke 5:12 ULB)

>When he saw Jesus, he bowed down to the ground in front of him and pleaded with him, "Lord, please heal me, because you are able to heal me if you are willing!"  (Luke 5:12 UDB) 

Here the UDB makes it clear that the man who had leprosy did not fall to the ground by accident; instead, he deliberately bowed down to the ground. Also, the UDB makes it clear that he is asking Jesus to heal him. He only implies this request in the ULB.

==== Symbolic Actions ====
A symbolic action is something that someone does in order to express a certain idea. The ULB often simply presents the symbolic action.  \\
The UDB often presents the idea expressed by the symbolic action as well. 

As a translator, you should decide whether your audience will correctly understand a symbolic action. If your audience will not understand, then you must do as the UDB does. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])

> The high priest tore his garments (Mark 14:63 ULB)

> In response to Jesus' words, the high priest __was so shocked__ that he tore his outer garment.  (Mark 14:63 UDB)

Here the UDB makes it clear that it was not by accident that the high priest tore his garment. It also makes clear that it was probably only his outer garment that he tore, and that he did so because he wanted to show that he was sad or angry or both. In this case, because the high priest actually tore his garment, the UDB must of course say that he did.

However, sometimes you do not have to represent an idea in your translation, if it means another idea without referencing an actual historical action.

>Present that to your governor; will he accept you or __will he lift up your face__?" (Malachi 1:8 ULB) 

>You would not dare to offer such gifts to your own governor! You know that he would not take them. You know that __he would be displeased with you!__ (Malachi 1:8 UDB) 

Here the biblical idea "lift up someone's face," represented in this way in the ULB, is presented as another idea in the UDB: "he would be displeased with you and would not welcome you."

==== Passive Verb Forms  ====
The ULB uses a wider variety of verb forms than the UDB does. Languages differ enormously from each other in how they express actions, events, and conditions. For example, both Biblical Hebrew and Greek often use passive verb forms, while many other languages do not have that possibility. 

The ULB features passive verb forms. \\ 
The UDB usually does not. As a result, the UDB must **restructure** many phrases. 

As a translator, you must decide whether the project language can present events or states using a passive expression, as in the following examples. If you decide that your translation cannot use passive expressions, then you may find in the UDB one possible way to restructure the phrases. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])

>For __he was amazed__, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had taken. (Luke 5:9 ULB) 

>He said this because he marveled at the huge number of fish that they had caught. All the men who were with him also marveled. (Luke 5:9 UDB) 

Here the UDB uses a verb in the active voice ("he marveled") instead of the ULB's verb in the passive voice ("was amazed").

> Large crowds of people came together to hear him teach and __to be healed__ of their sicknesses. (Luke 5:15 ULB)

>The result was that large crowds came to Jesus to hear him teach and to have him heal them from their sicknesses. (Luke 5:15 UDB) 

Here the UDB avoids the ULB's passive verb form "to be healed." It does this by restructuring the phrase. It says who the healer is: "to have him [Jesus] heal them."

====Metaphors and Other Figures of Speech==== 
The ULB often represents figures of speech found in the biblical texts as closely as possible. \\ 
The UDB often presents the meaning of these ideas in other ways. 

As a translator, you will have to decide whether the readers in the project language will understand a figure of speech with little effort, with some effort, or not at all. In the last case, you will have to present the essential meaning of the figure of speech using other words.

>He has __made you rich in every way__, in all speech and with all knowledge. (1 Corinthians 1:5 ULB) 

>Christ has given you so many things. He helped you to speak his truth and to know God. (1 Corinthians 1:5 UDB)

Paul uses a metaphor of material wealth, expressed in the word "rich." Even though he immediately explains what he means ("in all speech and with all knowledge"), some readers might not understand. The UDB presents the idea in a different way, without using the metaphor of material wealth. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])


>I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, (Matthew 10:16 ULB)

>When I send you out, you will be as defenseless as sheep, among people who are as dangerous as wolves. (Matthew 10:16 UDB)

Jesus uses a simile that compares his apostles going to others as sheep going out among wolves. Some readers might not understand how the apostles would be like sheep and the others would be like wolves. The UDB clarifies that the apostles would be defenseless and their enemies would be dangerous. 

>You are separated from Christ, all __you who are "justified" by the law__. You have fallen away from grace. (Galatians 5:4 ULB)

>__If you expect God to declare you good in his sight because you try to keep the law__, you have separated yourself from Christ; God will no longer act kindly toward you. (Galatians 5:4 UDB)

Paul uses irony when he refers to them as being justified by the law. He had already taught them that no one can be justified by the law. The ULB uses quote marks around "justified" to show that Paul did not believe that they were justified by the law. The UDB translates the same idea by making it clear that it was what the other people believed.

==== Abstract Expressions ==== 
The ULB often uses abstract nouns, adjectives, and other parts of speech, because it tries to closely resemble the biblical texts. \\
The UDB tries not to use such abstract expressions. 

As a translator, you will have to decide how the project language prefers to present these ideas. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])

>He has made you rich in every way, in __all speech__ and with __all knowledge__. (1 Corinthians 1:5 ULB)

>Christ has given you so many things. He helped you to speak his truth and to know God. (1 Corinthians 1:5 UDB)

Here the ULB expressions "all speech" and "all knowledge" are abstract noun expressions. One problem with them is that readers might not know who is supposed to do the speaking, or who is doing the knowing. The UDB makes these questions clear.

==== Conclusion ====

In summary, the ULB will help you translate, because it can help you understand to a significant degree what form the original biblical texts have. The UDB can help you translate, because it can help make the ULB text's meaning clear, and also because it can give you various possible solutions to adopt in your own translation.
