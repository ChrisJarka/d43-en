===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **make a roof for the boat**  - This is an actual peaked or slanted roof. It is not designed to be walked on, only to protect the occupants and shed weather (water). This is in contrast to normal boats where the top deck of a boat is outside and forms the roof of the interior deck below.
  * **a lower, a second, and a third deck**  - This can be translated as "a lower deck, a middle deck, and an upper deck" or "three decks inside" (UDB) or "three levels."
  * **deck**  - This can be translated as "floor" or "story" or "level" or "room."
  * **Listen**  - In this verse, "listen" is used to emphasize the certainty, communicated by God, of his commitment to destroy the earth in a flood. Alternate, "heed my words" or "pay attention"
  * **all flesh**  - While the primary focus is on human beings, animal life is also included.
