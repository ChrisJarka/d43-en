\v 12 Yahweh said to Moses,
\v 13 "Tell the Israelite people, 'Obey my instructions regarding the Sabbath days for rest. Those days will remind to me and to you and your descendants, throughout all future generations, that I, Yahweh, have set you apart to be my people.
\v 14 You must obey my rules about the Sabbath days for rest because you must regard them as special for me. Those who treat these days with disrespect must be killed; this will show that I no longer consider them to belong to my people.
\v 15 You may work for six days each week, but the seventh day of each week is a solemn rest day, dedicated to me, Yahweh. Anyone who does any work on a Sabbath day of rest is to be killed.

\v 12 Yahweh spoke to Moses:
\v 13 "Tell the Israelites: 'You must certainly keep Yahweh's Sabbath days, for these will be a sign between him and you throughout your people's  generations so that you may know that he is Yahweh, who sets you apart for himself.
\v 14 So you must keep the Sabbath, for it must be treated by you as holy, reserved for him. Everyone who defiles it must surely be put to death. Anyone who works on the Sabbath must surely be cut off from his people.
\v 15 Work will be done for six days, but the seventh day is to be a Sabbath of complete rest, holy, reserved for Yahweh's honor. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must surely be put to death.
