===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:beloved]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **beloved** - Some versions such as the UDB understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:01:12|1:13]].
  * **like a gazelle or a young stag** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:02:08|2:9]].
  * **gazelle** - a type of slender deer-like animal with long curved horns
  * **stag** - an adult male deer
  * **the mountains of spices** - "the mountains that have spices all over them." The woman uses this metaphor to invite the man to make love to her. See how the man uses the metaphor of a mountain of myrrh and a hill of frankincense in [[:en:bible:notes:sng:04:06|4:6]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
