\v 9 I wrote \add a letter\add* to the congregation \add telling them to help those fellow believers\add*. However, Diotrephes does not acknowledge my authority\f + \ft Or: \add pay any attention to what\add* I wrote \f*, because he desires to be in charge\f + \ft Or: wants to be the leader \f* of \add the congregation\add*.
\v 10 So, when I arrive \add there\add* I will \add publicly\add* tell what he does: He tells others evil nonsense about us \add in order to\add* harm \add us by what he\add* says, and he is not content with only doing that. He himself refuses to receive the fellow believers who are traveling around doing God's work, and he also stops those who want to receive them by expelling them from the congregation.

\v 9 I wrote a letter to your congregation to tell them to help those fellow believers. However, Diotrephes does not accept my letter.
\v 10 So when I arrive there I will publicly tell everyone what he does: He tells others evil nonsense about us in order to harm us by what he says. He is not content with only doing that, but he himself also refuses to welcome the fellow believers who are traveling around doing God's work. And those who want to welcome them--he stops them by making them leave the congregation.

\v 9 I wrote something to the congregation, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us.
\v 10 Therefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds that he does, how he says ridiculous things against us with evil words. And not content with these deeds, he himself does not receive the brothers, and forbids those who desire to and drives them out of the congregation.
