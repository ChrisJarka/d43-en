\v 7 Many years ago, as I was returning from Paddan-Aram\f + \ft Or: Mesopotamia \f*, your mother Rachel died in Canaan land, while we were still traveling, not far from Ephrath \add town\add*. So I buried her body there alongside the road to Ephrath (which is now called Bethlehem)."

\v 5 And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, they are mine. Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
\v 6 The children you have  after them will be yours; they will be listed under the the names of their brothers in their inheritance.
\v 7 But as for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way, while there was still some distance to go to Ephrath. I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."
