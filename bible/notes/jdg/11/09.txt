\v 9 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me home again to fight with the people of Ammon, and if Yahweh delivers them before me, will I be your head?”
\v 10 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “May Yahweh be witness between us! We will certainly act according to everything you say.”
\v 11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them; Jephthah said all his words again before Yahweh in Mizpah.
