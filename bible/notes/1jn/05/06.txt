\v 6  Think about Jesus Christ. He is the one who came  to earth from God. God showed that he had truly sent Jesus when Jesus was baptized in water , but also when Jesus' blood flowed  from his body when he died. And  God's Spirit declares  truthfully that Jesus Christ came from God. The Spirit always  speaks what is true.
\v 7 There are three  things by which we knowthat Christ came from God.
\v 8  Those three things are: What God's Spirit  tells us, what God said when Jesus was baptized  water, and  Jesus' blood  that flowed from his body when he died on the cross. These three things all tell us the same thing, that Jesus came from God.

\v 6 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood.
\v 7 And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.
\v 8 For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one.
