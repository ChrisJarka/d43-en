\v 17 He said to me, "You human, you see \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what they are doing. \add Do you think that\add* it is not important that these men of Judah are doing these detestable things here? \add But they are doing other terrible things\add*. They are acting violently throughout their country, and continually causing me to be angry. Look at them! They are insulting me by their actions [IDI]!
\v 18 So I will show them that I am very angry. I will not pity them or act mercifully toward them. And even if they shout to me \add to help them\add*, I will not pay attention to them."

\v 17 He said to me, "Son of man, do you see  what they are doing? Do you think that it is not important that these men of Judah are doing these detestable things here? But they are doing other terrible things. They are acting violently throughout their country, and continually provoking my anger. Look at them! They are insulting me by their actions of false worship!
\v 18 So I will show them that I am very angry. I will not pity them or act mercifully toward them. And even if they shout loudly to me to help them, I will not pay attention to them."

\v 17 God said to me, "Do you see this, Son of man? Is it a little thing for the house of Judah to do these abominations that they are doing
here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger, holding up branches to their noses.
\v 18 So I will also act among them; my eye will not have compassion, and I will not spare them. Though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, 
I will not hear them!"
