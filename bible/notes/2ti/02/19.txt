The gold and silver utensils are used at special occasions to do great things for the Lord Jesus, and there are those like the teachers of false doctrines, Or: teachings who are not.  In a rich man's home are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some valuable and some are not valuable.
