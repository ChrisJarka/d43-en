=== What is the Book of Acts about? ===

The book of Acts is the history of the church for about 30 years after Jesus’ ascension. It covers a period of evangelism and church planting in which the church expanded from Jerusalem, through Asia Minor, and on to Rome and beyond. It is the history of the early church and an account of power of God, the Spirit of God, working in the early church. Acts is addressed to “Theophilus.” Perhaps this is the name of a person, but more likely, the name, which means, “One who loves God,” is a Christian to whom Luke addresses this book, perhaps Theophilus had supported Luke in his work of writing the Gospel of Luke and Acts.
 
Acts is the account of faith and hardship, miracles and judgment. Some called this book, “The Acts of the Holy Spirit” because the coming of the Spirit of God into the lives of God’s people is the beginning of the church. As the Spirit guided and helped the early Christians, they began to fulfill the Great Commission of Matthew 28:19–20. This is an account of the early Christians’ experience of God with them, continuing Jesus’ ministry on earth.
 
Luke covered the life and ministry of Jesus from his birth to his death and resurrection, and after that, Acts covered the expansion of the church for another thirty years or so. Luke and Acts together covered a period of almost 70 years. Luke and Acts were written about the mid AD 60s.

Acts records how the plan of God was to work through his people, and the opportunities and difficulties the early church experienced.  Luke believed the early church was directed by God and that is was his plan to spread the Gospel of Christ around the world. In this book we see angels, we observe miracles, and watch Scripture being fulfilled. People experience visions and some of them speak in tongues, and the Spirit directs them where they are to go.
 
Acts was a continuation of Christ’s earthly ministry, and now he is working through his church. Christ was the one who was working in the church.  And in Acts we read that the early believers were first called “Christians” (11:26).

=== Who wrote the Book of Acts? ===
