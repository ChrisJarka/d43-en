===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Habakkuk speaks to Yahweh about the Chaldeans.

  * **Are you not from ancient times, Yahweh my God, my Holy One?** - Habakkuk asks this rhetorical question to emphasize the positive answer. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "You surely are from ancient times, Yahweh my God, my Holy One." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **from ancient times** - "eternal"
  * **has ordained them for judgment, and you, Rock, have established them for correction** - The word "them" refers to the Chaldeans. The words "judgment" and "correction" can be translated with verbs. The reader should understand that the Chaldeans will judge and correct Yahweh's people. AT: "has ordained them to judge his people, and you, Rock, have established them to correct your people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Rock** - Habakkuk speaks of Yahweh being the one who protects him and keeps him safe as if he were a rock upon which Habakkuk could stand in order to be out of his enemies' reach. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
