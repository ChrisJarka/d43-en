\p
\v 1 The oracle of the desert by the sea.
\p Like stormwinds from the Nege it comes passing through from the desert, from a terrible land.
\v 2 A distressing vision has been told to me; the treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; besiege, Media; I will stop all her groaning.
