\v 13 If you found it, I affirm to you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* that you would rejoice very much. You would be happy that ninety-nine sheep did not stray away, but you would rejoice even more \add because you had found\add* the sheep that had strayed away.
\v 14 In the same way \add that the shepherd does not want one of\add* his \add sheep to stray away\add*, so \add God\add*, your Father in heaven, does not want \add even\add* one of these children to go to hell."

\v 12 What do you think you would do in the following situation? If you had one hundred sheep and one of them got lost, you would surely leave the ninety-nine sheep that were on the hillside and go and search for the lost one, would you not?
\v 13 If you found it, I affirm to you that you would rejoice very much. You would be happy that ninety-nine sheep did not stray away, but you would rejoice even more because you had found the sheep that had strayed away.
\v 14 In the same way that the shepherd does not want one of his sheep to stray away, so God, your Father in heaven, does not want even one of these children to go to hell."

\v 12 What do you think? If any person has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the hillside and go off seeking the one that went astray?
\v 13 And if he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. 
\v 14 In the same way, it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **What do you think **- this whole verse is a rhetorical question presenting a hypothetical situation; it is widely understood that a shepherd would go looking for a lost sheep.
  * **If any person has one hundred sheep…does he not **- Matthew uses a metaphor to liken God's people to sheep and Himself to a good shepherd.
  * **If any person… **- hypothetical situation. Jesus has them pretending they had one hundred sheep and one wandered away.
  * **it is not the will…should perish **- could translate "Your Father in heaven wants none of these little ones to perish."
