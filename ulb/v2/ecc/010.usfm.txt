\c 10
\p
\v 1 Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor;
so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.
\v 2 A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.
\v 3 Yes also, when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to every one
that he is a fool.
\v 4 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not your place; for gentleness allayeth great offences.
\v 5 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler:
\v 6 folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.
\v 7 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like servants upon the earth.
\v 8 He that digs a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaks through a wall, a serpent shall bite him.
\v 9 Whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that clings wood is endangered thereby.
\v 10 If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to
direct.
\v 11 If the serpent bite before it is charmed, then is there no advantage in the charmer.
\v 12 The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
\v 13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
\v 14 A fool also multiplies words: yet man knows not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can
tell him?
\v 15 The labor of fools wearieth every one of them; for he knows not how to go to the city.
\v 16 Woe to thee, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning!
\v 17 Happy are thou, O land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for
drunkenness!
\v 18 By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.
\v 19 A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes glad the life; and money answereth all things.
\v 20 Revile not the king, no, not in your thought; and revile not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the heavens shall
carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.
