\v 1 We \add know about\add* many people like that\add who showed they trusted in God\add*. They are like a crowd of spectators \add who are cheering for us inside a stadium\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Knowing that, we must put away all the things that hinder us, \add as a runner puts aside everything that would hinder him because they are heavy\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Especially we must put away sinful actions that \add hinder us, as a runner\add* sets aside clothes he does not need, clothes that would entangle him \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Let us \add wholeheartedly strive to achieve what God has planned for us, as someone\add* in a race wholeheartedly runs the course that is before him \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 2 And let us \add keep our minds on\add* Jesus, \add as a runner\add* keeps his eyes on \add the goal\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. He is the one we should imitate concerning how he perfectly trusted \add God. When he died on\add* the cross he endured it when he suffered greatly \f + \ft metonymy \f*, instead of \add thinking about the things he would\add* rejoice about \add later\add*. He disregarded being disgraced by \add dying that way\add*. He is now sitting at the place of highest honor \f + \ft metonymy \f* at the throne \add where God rules\add*.


\p
\v 3 \add Jesus\add* patiently endured it when sinful people acted so hostilely against him. Compare yourselves with him so that you do not give up \add trusting\add* God or become discouraged.
\v 4 While you have struggled against \add being tempted to\add* sin, you have not yet bled \add and died because of resisting evil, as Jesus did\add*.
\v 5 Do not forget \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* these words \add that Solomon spoke to his son, that are the same as God\add* would exhort you as his children:
\q My child, pay attention \f + \ft litotes \f* when the Lord is disciplining you,
\q and do not be discouraged when the Lord punishes you \f + \ft doublet \f*,
\q
\v 6 because it is everyone whom he loves whom the Lord disciplines,
\q and he punishes everyone whom he accepts as his child.

\v 1 We know about many people like these who trusted in God when most other people would not trust God. They are like a crowd of spectators who are cheering for us inside a stadium. So we also must put away everything that hinders us, as a runner removes heavy things from himself. Especially we must put away sinful actions that hinder us, as a runner sets aside clothes that would entangle him. Let us strive to finish all God has given us to do, even when we get tired and it is hard to keep working, just like a runner in a race keeps running through pain all the way to finish line.
\v 2 And let us keep our minds on Jesus, as a runner keeps his eyes on the goal. He is the One we trust because he perfectly trusted the Father and because He is God the Son. 
He endured the intense suffering of the cross and ignored being publicly shamed because he understood the great joy that would come to believers, since God would forgive their sins forever. He now sits at the place of highest honor at the throne where God rules in heaven.


\p
\v 3 Jesus patiently endured it when sinful people hatefully acted against him. Strengthen your hearts and minds with Jesus' great courage so that you will not give up trusting God or become discouraged.
\v 4 While you have struggled against being tempted to sin, you have not yet bled and died because of resisting evil, as Jesus did.
\v 5 Do not forget these words that Solomon spoke to his son, that are the same as God would exhort you as his children:
\q "My child, pay attention when the Lord is disciplining you,
\q and do not be discouraged when the Lord punishes you,
\q
\v 6 because everyone whom the Lord loves he also disciplines,
\q and he punishes everyone whom he accepts as his child."

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Therefore since we are surrounded with such a large crowd of witnesses, let us throw off everything that weighs us down and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us,
\v 2 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, ignored the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
\v 3 For consider him who has endured such hatred from sinners against himself, so that you  do not become weary or faint hearted.
s5
\v 4 You have not yet resisted to the point of blood, struggling against sin.
\v 5 And you have forgotten the encouragement which instructs you as sons,
\q "My son, do not lightly regard the discipline of the Lord,
\q Nor lose heart when you are corrected by him;"
\q
\v 6 For whom the Lord loves he disciplines,
\q And he punishes every son whom he receives.
