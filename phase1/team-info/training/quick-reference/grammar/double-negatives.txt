====== Double Negatives ======


===== Description =====

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION.**

In some languages people use more than one negative in a phrase simply to express the negative. For example in Brazilian Portuguese "Eu não vi ninguém" has both the word não which means "not" and ninguém, which means "no one." It simply means "I did not see anyone." And in some varieties of English people say  "I didn't see nobody" to mean "I did not see anybody." 

Sometimes people use a double negative simply __to express that a negative idea is not true.__ For example, someone might say "No one escaped the fire" and some might reply "No. There was__n't__  anyone who did__n't__ escape." (OK, maybe a little far-fetched. If you can think of a good example please tell me. Susan Q)

Sometimes people use a double negative __to emphasize that the opposite is very true__. For example, "It is not unlikely" could mean "It is very likely."  

And sometimes people use a double negative __to emphasize in an ironic way that the opposite is true__.  "She was __not__ __un__attractive" could mean "She was very attractive." In this case, it is also a figure of speech called Litotes.

**Examples of Negatives**: \\ 
Lexical items: no, not, none, no one, nothing, nowhere, never, nor, neither \\ 
Affixes: non-, un-, in-, -less \\
Should we include verbs like "neglect," "fail," and "refuse," "prohibit," "stop"?

**Caution:** - Just because a word has a negative affix does not mean that we should count it. For example "Wicked people will __not__ go __un__punished" means that wicked people will be punished, but "Do not unzip it" does not mean "Zip it up," and "Do not __dis__assemble it" does not mean "Assemble it."

=== Genesis 11:6 ===

"Yahweh said, "Look, they are one people with the same language, and they are beginning to do this! Soon __nothing__ that they intend to do will be __im__possible for them."

  * **(1) nothing that they intend to do will be impossible for them** - **(3)** This double negative means they can do anything they intend to do. **(4)** This can also be translated as "anything they intend to do will be possible for them." AT: "they will be able to do anything they want to do." **(5)** (See: Double Negatives)

=== Luke 11:42 ===

"But woe to you Pharisees, because you tithe the mint and rue and every other garden herb, but you neglect justice and the love of God. It is necessary to act justly and love God, with__out__ __failing__ to do the other things also."

    * **(1) without failing to do the other things also** - **(3)** This double-negative means they should tithe and do justice and love God.  **(4)** AT: "and to always do the other good things as well." **(5)** (See: Double Negatives)

=== Titus 3:14 ===

"Our people must learn to engage themselves in good works that meet urgent needs so that they may __not__ be __un__fruitful."

  * **(1) so that they may not be unfruitful**  - **(3)** This double-negative means they should be fruitful or productive. **(4)** AT: "so they will be fruitful" or "so they can produce fruit for God" or "so their lives will be useful." **(5)** (See: Double Negatives)
