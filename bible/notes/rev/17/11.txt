===== translationWords: =====

  * [[:en:obe:other:beast]]
  * [[:en:obe:other:king]]

===== translationNotes: ===== 

  * **he is one of those seven kings** - Possible meanings are that 1) the beast rules twice: first as one of the seven kings, and then as the eighth king, or 2) the beast belongs to that group of seven kings because he is like them.
  * **he is going to destruction** - The certainty of what will happen in the future is spoken of as if he were going to it. AT: "he will certainly be destroyed" or "God will surely destroy him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
