\v 10 And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith you
might be bound.
\v 11 And he said to her, If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work has been done, then shall I become weak, and
be as another man.
\v 12 So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And the
liers-in-wait were living in the inner chamber. And he brake them off his arms like a thread.
