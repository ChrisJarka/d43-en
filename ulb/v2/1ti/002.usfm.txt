\c 2
\p
\v 1 I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men;
\v 2 for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.
\v 3 This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
\v 4 who would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.
\v 5 For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men,
himself man, Christ Jesus,
\v 6 who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony to be borne
in its own times;
\v 7 whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
truth.
\p
\v 8 I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing.
\v 9 In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and
gold or pearls or costly raiment;
\v 10 but (which becomes women professing godliness) through good works.
\v 11 Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.
\v 12 But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness.
\v 13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve;
\v 14 and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled has fallen into transgression:
\v 15 but she shall be saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.
