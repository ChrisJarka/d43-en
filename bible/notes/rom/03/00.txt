====== Romans 03 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 3:4, 10-18, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

Chapter 2 explained that all Jews are condemned because they violated the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Moses]] and that Gentiles could be [[:en:obe:kt:save|saved]]. Chapter 3 answers the question: what advantage does being a Jew have over being a Gentile?

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Universal Condemnation ==

This chapter explains that the whole world is without excuse and has enough knowledge to seek after and [[:en:obe:kt:believe|believe]] in the true God, Yahweh. [[:en:obe:kt:sin|Sin]] is a problem for all of mankind and enslaves the unbeliever in their sin. This refutes the common understanding that "all people are basically good."

== "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God" ==
The standard required for entrance into [[:en:obe:kt:heaven|heaven]] and being in the presence of God is perfection. Anything less than perfect leads to [[:en:obe:kt:condemn|condemnation]].

== The purpose of the law of Moses ==
Obedience to the Law cannot [[:en:obe:kt:justify|justify]] a person. The Law does not justify a person but is a way a person displays their [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]] in God. It has always been faith that justified a person.

=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Rhetorical Questions ==
These are frequently used in this chapter. It appears the intent of these [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|rhetorical question]] is to make the reader feel [[:en:obe:kt:guilt|guilty]], or to convict them in their sin and ultimately bring them to faith in Jesus.
