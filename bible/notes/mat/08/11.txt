\v 11 And I say to you, that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:
\v 12 but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of
teeth.
\v 13 And Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way; as you have believed,
so be it done to thee. And the servant was healed in that hour.
