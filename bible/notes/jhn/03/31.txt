\v 31 He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that
comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 What he has seen and heard, of that he bears witness; and no man receiveth his witness.
\v 33 He that has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.
