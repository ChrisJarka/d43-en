===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why are you still being struck? Why do you rebel more and more?** - Isaiah uses these questions to scold the people of Judah. These could be translated as statements with active verbs: "You keep doing things that Yahweh has to punish you for. You continue to rebel against him" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]] and [[:en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **You** - Here the word "you" is plural and refers to the people who live in Judah. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:formsofyou-plural]])
  * **The whole head is sick, the whole heart faint** - This compares the kingdom of Judah to a person who is sick and hurting. Just as there are physical wounds and emotional pain that indicate a person is unhealthy, there are also signs that show that a nation is continually sinning against God. Isaiah shows some of these signs in 1:7-8. This could be translated as "You are like someone whose whole mind and heart are sick." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **they have not been closed, cleansed, bandaged, nor treated with oil**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "no one is there to close, cleanse, bandage, or treat them with oil."
