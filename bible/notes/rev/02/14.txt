===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 14 Nevertheless, I have this  \add complaint\add* against you: You permit some of your  \add members\add* to teach things like Balaam  \add taught long ago. He\add* taught Balak to persuade the Israelite people to sin. \add Specifically\add*, he taught them to eat food that had been offered to idols, and to practice sexual immorality.
\v 15 In that way, you are also permitting some of  \add your members\add* to practice what the Nicolaitans teach, \add which is like what Balaam taught\add*.

\v 14 Nevertheless, you have done something wrong: You permit some of your members to teach things like Balaam taught long ago. He taught Balak to persuade the Israelite people to sin. Specifically, he taught them to eat food that had been offered to idols and to practice sexual immorality.
\v 15 In that way, you are also permitting some of your members to practice what the Nicolaitans teach.

\v 14 But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold tightly to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.
\v 15 So you even have some who hold tightly to the teaching of the Nicolaitans in the same manner.
