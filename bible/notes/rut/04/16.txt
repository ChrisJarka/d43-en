===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **laid him in her bosom**  - held him close against her chest.
  * **guardian** - "nursed". She was active in caring for the child as if it were her own child.
  * **There is a son born to Naomi ** -  "The child is like a son to Naomi" or "grandson". It was understood that the child was not Naomi's physical son.
