====== Copy or Borrow Words ======

There are times that the international, trade or national language may have words that your language does not have. Sometimes your language may not have a word for a certain person, place, or thing that is in the source text.

The words in the Bible that you will copy or borrow most are the proper names of people, places and things. You may also copy or borrow from the source text common names of things that your language does not already have a word for.

There are several things to be aware of when translating words from one language into another.

  * Different languages use different scripts, such as the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Cyrillic, Devenagari, and Korean scripts. These scripts use different shapes to represent the letters in their alphabets.
  * Languages that use the same script might pronounce the letters in that script differently. For example, when speaking German, people pronounce the letter “j” the same way that people pronounce the letter “y” when speaking English.
  * Languages do not all have the same sounds or combinations of sounds. For example, many languages do not have the soft “th” sound in the English word “think.”

There are several senses of the word transliterate.

  * One sense of “transliterate” is simply to write a word of one language by substituting each letter shape with the corresponding letter shape of the script of your language.
  * Another sense of “transliterate” is to modify the spelling to fit the spelling conventions of your language. For example if Greek uses “gg” to represent the “ng” sound you might change the spelling to “ng”.
  * Another sense of “transliterate” is to adjust the spelling to fit the sound system of your language. For example a language that never ends a word with “d” might spell the name “David” as “Davit.”
