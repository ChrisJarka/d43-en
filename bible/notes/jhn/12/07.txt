===== Translation Notes: =====

Judas had just asked why Mary wasted the expensive perfume by putting it on Jesus' feet.

    * **Allow her to keep what she has** - Jesus is really saying that what Mary has done is for his burial. It is to her benefit that she did this. It is implied that she will be rewarded for this and that it was more important than taking care of the poor would have been.
