\v 17 By the authority of the Lord Jesus, I strongly affirm that you must no longer conduct your lives like unbelievers do. The futile way in which they think controls how they conduct their lives.
\v 18 They are unable to think clearly about what is right and what is wrong. Because they have decided that they do not want to know about God and because they stubbornly refuse to listen to his message, they do not have the eternal life that God gives us.
\v 19 The result is that because they have ceased to care about what is right and what is wrong, they have deliberately committed themselves to doing the shameful things that their bodies want, and they commit all kinds of immoral acts, and continually are eager to do more of those things.

\v 17 This I say therefore, and urge you in the Lord, that you no longer live as the Gentiles live, whose way of thinking is worthless,
\v 18 unable to understand as if their minds are in the dark, they are alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them and the stubbornness of their heart.
\v 19 Indeed they are past feeling and have given themselves over to lustful pleasure to greedily practice every kind of impurity.
