\v 15 \add I suppose that certain people might think about what I have just said and they might\add* say \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, "\add You say that\add* the laws \add God gave Moses\add* did not \add enable us to stop sinning, but that God is now\add* treating us kindly in ways we do not deserve. \add That seems to mean that God permits\add* us to continue sinning.\f + \ft Or: \add Does that mean that God permits\add* us to continue sinning? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" My reply to that is no, we should certainly not continue \add sinning\add*!
\v 16 \add Slaves\add* have to obey\add what their masters command\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add them to do\add*. I want you to remember this.\f + \ft Or:  Do you not know this? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Similarly, if you present yourselves to someone \add in order to\add* obey him, you will be the slaves \f + \ft metaphor \f* of the person you obey. Similarly, \add if you have yielded yourselves to do the\add* sinful things \add you desire\add*, you are slaves of your sinful desires \f + \ft personification \f*, and you will be eternally separated from God. \add If you have yielded yourselves\add* to obey \add God\add*, you are slaves of God and you need to \add live\add* righteously.

\v 15 Somebody might say to me, â€œYou say that the laws God gave Moses did not enable us to stop sinning, but that God is now treating us kindly in ways we do not deserve. That seems to mean that God permits us to continue sinning." My reply to that is no, we should certainly not continue sinning!
\v 16 If you offer to obey someone, you become his slaves. If you sin when you wish to sin, then you become the slaves of sin. But if you obey God, then you become his slaves in order to obey him always.

\v 15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be.
\v 16 Do you not know that the one to whom you present yourselves as servants for obedience, you are the servants of the one whom you obey, whether of sin for death, or of obedience for righteousness?

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul uses slavery as a metaphor for obedience and disobedience to God.

  * **What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be.**  - Paul is using a question to emphasize that living under grace is not a reason to sin. Alternate translation: "However, just because we are bound to grace instead of the Law of Moses certainly does not mean we are allowed to sin."(See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **Do you not know that the one to whom you present yourselves as servants for obedience, you are the servants of the one whom you obey**  - Paul uses a question to scold anyone who may think God's grace is a reason to keep sinning. Alternate translation: "You should know that you are slaves to the master you choose to obey."
  * **whether of sin for death, or of obedience for righteousness**  - Here, "sin" and "obedience" are described as masters that a slave would serve. This could be translated as a new sentence: "You are either a slave to sin which results in spiritual death, or you are a slave to obedience which results in God declaring you righteous." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:personification|Personification]])
