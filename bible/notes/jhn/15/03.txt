<usfm>
\v 3 You are already \add like\add* the branches \add that a gardener\add* trims because \add you have believed\add* the message that I have told you.
\v 4 Remain having a close relationship with me. \add If you do that\add*, I will remain having a close relationship with you. A branch \add of a vine\add* cannot bear fruit \add if it is cut off and left\add* by itself. To bear fruit, it must remain attached to the vine. Similarly, you cannot \add live the way that God wants you to\add* if you do not remain united to me \f + \ft metaphor \f*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 You are already pure because of the message I spoke to you.
\v 4 If you remain joined to me, and I will remain joined to you. As the branch cannot bear any fruit on its own, neither can you unless you stay joined to me and depend upon me for everything.

\v 3 Already you are clean because of the message that I have spoken to you.
\v 4 Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.
