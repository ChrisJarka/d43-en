\v 13 And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
\v 14 Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this
deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.
\v 15 For thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this
land.
