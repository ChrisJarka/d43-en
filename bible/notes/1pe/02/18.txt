\v 18 Servants, obey your masters with all respect, not only the good and gentle masters, but also obey the mean ones
\v 19 because it is acceptable for a man to endure grief and to suffer because of his conscience toward God.
\v 20 If you receive punishment because of your sin, it is no special honor to receive your punishment with patience. But if you receive punishment because you do good, and you take the punishment with patience, this is the grace of God.
