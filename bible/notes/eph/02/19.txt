Christ Jesus is the \add most important one in that group, just like a\add* cornerstone \add is the most important part of a building\add*. And
\v 21 just like \add a builder might\add* join together all the parts of a building to make it a temple that \add people will\add* dedicate to the Lord \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add Christ is continually causing all of\add* you who have a relationship with \add him to be united, in order that you will become one holy group\add*.

\v 19 So God no longer treats you non-Jews as people treat foreigners and strangers who live among them. Instead, along with all God's people, it is as though you have become citizens of a country that he rules over, and as though you have become members of the family of which he is that father.
\v 20 Just like a building is built on a foundation, God has joined you into one group that originated from what the apostles and prophets taught. Christ Jesus is the most important one in that group, just like a cornerstone is the most important part of a building. And
\v 21 just like a builder might join together all the parts of a building to make it a temple that people will dedicate to the Lord, Christ is continually causing all of you who have a relationship with him to be united, in order that you will become one holy group.
\v 22 And because of your relationship with Christ, God is joining you non-Jews together with Jewish believers to be like one building in which his Spirit lives.

\v 19 So then you are no more strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,
\v 20 being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone;
\v 21 in whom each several building, fitly framed together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord;
\v 22 in whom you also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.
