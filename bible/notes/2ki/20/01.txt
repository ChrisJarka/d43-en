\v 1 In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus
says Jehovah, Set your house in order; for you shall die, and not live.
\v 2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Jehovah, saying,
\v 3 Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done
that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
