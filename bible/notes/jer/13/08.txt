\v 8 Then Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 9 "\add What happened to your waistcloth\add* shows that I will destroy the things that the people of Jerusalem and \add other places in\add* Judah are very proud of.
\v 10 Those wicked people refuse to pay attention to what I say. They stubbornly do just what they desire to do; they worship other gods. Therefore, they will become completely useless, like your waistcloth.
\v 11 Just like a waistcloth clings closely\f + \ft Or: tightly \f* to a man's waist, I wanted the people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Israel and Judah to cling closely to me. I wanted them to be my people, people who would praise me and honor me. But they would not pay attention to me.

\v 8 Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 9 Thus says Jehovah, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
\v 10 This evil people, that refuse to hear my words, that walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other
gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is profitable for nothing.
\v 11 For as the girdle clings to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave to me the whole house of Israel and the
whole house of Judah, says Jehovah; that they may be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory:
but they would not hear.
