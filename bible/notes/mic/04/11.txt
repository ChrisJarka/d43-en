===== Translation Notes: =====

       * **For he has gathered them like sheaves for the threshing floor**  - a Threshing floor is used for the act of separating out grain by the feet of people or oxen and still later with the use of a flail. AT: God is seperating from those he wants and does not want. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
