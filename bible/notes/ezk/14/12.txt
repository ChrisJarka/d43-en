\v 12 And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
\v 13 Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the
staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast;
\v 14 though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their
righteousness, says the Lord Jehovah.
