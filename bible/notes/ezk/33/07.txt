\v 7 So thou, son of man, I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give
them warning from me.
\v 8 When I say to the wicked, O wicked man, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way;
that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at your hand.
\v 9 Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way; he shall die in his
iniquity, but you have delivered your soul.
