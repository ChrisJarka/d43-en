\v 19 I feel very sorry for women who will be pregnant and women who will be nursing their babies in those days, because it will be very difficult for them to run away!
\v 20 Pray that you will not have to flee in the winter when it will be hard to travel. People who think that God never allows anyone to do any work on our day of rest will not help you as you flee, so pray also that you will not have to flee on such a day,
\v 21 because people will suffer very severely when those things happen. People have never suffered that severely since God created the world until now, and no one will ever suffer like that again.
\v 22 If God had not decided to shorten that time when people will suffer so much, everyone would die. But he has decided to shorten it because he is concerned about the people whom he has chosen."

\v 19 But woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!
\v 20 And pray you that your flight be not in the winter, neither on a sabbath:
\v 21 for then shall be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall
be.
\v 22 And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the electâ€™s sake those days shall be
shortened.
