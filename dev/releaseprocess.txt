====== Release Process ======


Our workflow for releasing mobile apps looks like this:

  * Developer tags git tree with a version number, appending -beta and build number if it's not a production release.
  * On the Github releases page, fill out bullet list of release notes.  If this is a development release, then mark it as "development".
  * Dev can upload app file to the release and can announce on Slack.  See short URLs below.
  * David or I will bump the version in the uW Dashboard Basecamp Project if this is a production release.
  * David or I will finish the publishing process by pushing to the relevant app storefronts, torrent link, and anything else we can think of.

We have setup short URLs that redirect to the Github releases page for each app:
