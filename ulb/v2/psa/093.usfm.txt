\v 1 Jehovah reigneth; he is clothed with majesty;
\q Jehovah is clothed with strength; he has girded himself therewith:
\q The world also is established, that it cannot be moved.
\q
\v 2 Your throne is established of old:
\q You are from everlasting.
\q
\v 3 The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah,
\q The floods have lifted up their voice;
\q The floods lift up their waves.
\q
\v 4 Above the voices of many waters,
\q The mighty breakers of the sea,
\q Jehovah on high is mighty.
\q
\v 5 Your testimonies are very sure:
\q Holiness becomes your house,
\q O Jehovah, for evermore.
