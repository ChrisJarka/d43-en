**What is 2 Kings about?**

The book of 2 Kings have much to say about the prophets of Israel and Judah. 2 Kings also shows the great impact Deuteronomy had on the religion of that time. This is especially seen in the account of the rediscovery of Deuteronomy in the Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem during the reign of Josiah (see: 2 Kings 22–23), and how the rediscovery of this book of Moses led to the reforms of the religious life of the nation. The [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Yahweh]] teaches that all the people, including the king, are responsible to keep the Law of Yahweh. The success of the nation and their blessings were not measured in terms of military conquests, but in terms of the degree to which they followed the Law of Yahweh. 1 and 2 Kings show the nation of Israel at its height and its eventual defeat brought about by their failure to obey the [[:en:obe:kt:covenant|covenant]].

**How should the title of this book be translated?**  \\ 
It is suggested that translators use a self-explanatory title or follow the regional or the national language versions of the Bible (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|Translate Names]]). "2 Kings" is named for the events of the book which focus on the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah. It is likely that the books of 1 and 2 Kings were originally one book but were separated because they could not be printed together in one volume. One possible title is "The second book about the kings."

**Who wrote 1 Kings?**\\
The book of 1 Kings likely contains many different historical accounts which were put together. It is likely that the book was finished during the exile in Babylon. The writers of Kings refer to other resources that they used in writing their history. These were titles non-biblical sources such as “The Book of the Acts of Solomon,” “The Records of the Kings of Judah,” and “The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel,” they identify the source, and named the book they used, in many cases.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====
**What is the religious purpose of 1 Kings?**\\
The book was likely written during the exile, after the temple had been destroyed. Since the temple and the [[:en:obe:kt:promisedland|Promised Land]] had such great significance both religiously and culturally, the writer may have tried to explain why they were in exile and how do the worship Yahweh without the Temple. The prophets begin to serve a major function for the people and the nation.

**Does the Bible condone polygamy in 1 Kings?**\\

While many important figures in 1 Kings do practice polygamy and the book does not condemn them for it, this does not mean that it was an acceptable practice.  Elsewhere in Scripture, Yahweh explicitly condemns the practice.

**Could there only be one Temple?**\\
1 Kings 12:25-33 records King Jeroboam of the kingdom of Israel as building a second temple in Samaria so that his people did not need to travel to the kingdom of Judah to worship Yahweh. He also set up his own priesthood in the kingdom of Israel. 1 Kings soundly condemns this actions because the presence of the Lord was not in this temple and because there were elements of Baal worship there. God punished them for this.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

**Why does the book refer to someone being addressed indirectly?**\\
David frequently refers to himself as "your servant" when he speaks to King Saul. He also calls Saul "my master." This type of indirect reference can be difficult to translate. It is intended to show submissiveness to the one addressed. English sometimes uses the address "sir" or "ma'am" in this way.

**What does the king "did what was right/evil in the eyes of Yahweh" mean?**\\

The phrase, a king “did what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh” is repeated throughout 2 Kings. For example, King Omri, was very successful in terms of conquest, but was judged a failure in that “he did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh.” The achievements or failures of the people and their kings were all were measured by the keeping of the covenant and obedience to the Law of Yahweh. The writer also uses the phrases “the way of the kings of Israel” and “the way of the house of Ahab” in a similar manner.

**What is the meaning of the term Israel?**\\
Israel is used in many different ways in Scripture. The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, were a people group who became known as Israel.  This people group is also the [[:en:obe:other:israel|nation of Israel]]. After the civil war in the nation of Israel, the tribes in the north took the name Israel, which is a reference to the "[[:en:obe:other:kingdomofisrael|kingdom of Israel]]." 2 Kings references both the northern kingdom of Israel and the whole nation of Israel as "Israel".

**Can I translate 2 Kings before 1 Kings?**\\
It is not suggested to translate 2 Kings before 1 Kings.
