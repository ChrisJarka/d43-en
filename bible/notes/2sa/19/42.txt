\v 42 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then are you angry
for this matter? have we eaten at all at the kingâ€™s cost? or has he given us any gift?
\v 43 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more
right in David than you: why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our
king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
