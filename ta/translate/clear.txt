====== Create Clear Translations ======

Watch the video for the [[http://youtu.be/aS28jGcTqTc|computer]] or the [[http://youtu.be/kooHCk9hgIg|portable device]].

To create a clear translation from the source text into your language you:

  * Check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.
  * Understand who is doing the action. A clear translation will identify the subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it.
  * May need to change each EVENT idea into an active clause.
  * May need to change passive verbs to the active form.
  * Look at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the possessive construction.



=== Check Pronouns ===
You will need to **check the pronouns**  in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers. Pronouns are words that stand in the place of a noun or a noun phrase. They refer back to something that has already been mentioned.\\
Always check carefully that it is clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.

=== Identify Participants ===
Next you need to **understand who is doing the action.**  The PARTICIPANTS in an event are the people or things which take part in that event. When re-expressing an EVENT idea as a verb, it is often necessary to state who or what are the PARTICIPANTS in that event. Usually this will be clear from the context.

A clear translation will **identify the PARTICIPANTS**. The subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it.

=== Change Event Ideas ===
You may need to **change each EVENT idea into an active clause** to be sure it is understood. Later, if your language will allow you to change active verbs into EVENT ideas, try to use the noun form.

When preparing to translate, it is helpful to look for any EVENT ideas in the passage, especially those which are expressed by some form other than a verb. See if you can re-express the meaning using a verb to express the EVENT idea.
A clear translation may need to **express EVENT ideas as verbs**.

=== Passive Verbs ===
You may need to change **any PASSIVE verbs to the ACTIVE form**.
In the ACTIVE form, the subject of the sentence is the person who does the action. In the PASSIVE form, the subject of the sentence is the person or thing to which the action is done.
Many languages do not have a PASSIVE form, only the ACTIVE form exists. Therefore, it may be necessary to turn a sentence from the PASSIVE form into the ACTIVE form.

A clear translation may need to change PASSIVE verbs to the ACTIVE form.

=== Look at Each 'Of' Phrase ===
You will also need to **look at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the possessive construction**. In many languages, “of” constructions are not as frequent as they are in Greek, the original language of the New Testament books. Study the meaning of each one and re-express the meaning of the phrase in a way which makes the relationship between the parts clear.

A clear translation looks at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the possessive construction.

Translation is re-telling, as exactly as possible, the meaning of the original message in a way that is clear and natural in the target language.

**Word for Word Substitution**  - Literal translations, or word for word substitution, is not the best choice for doing clear translations because they look only at individual words in the text, result in awkward text, may contain improper grammar, and presents an unclear or wrong meaning in the target text. Watch the video for the [[http://youtu.be/ZUCo2AZlj4A|computer]] or the [[http://youtu.be/_HLy-SkQxzo|portable device]] to learn why word-for-word translations are not the best choice.
