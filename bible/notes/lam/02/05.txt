\q
\v 5 The Lord has become like an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel. [Instantiation of BH conceptual metaphor EATING IS DESTROYING, where swallowing is necessary in the eating process. I prob. recommend losing the conc. met. here. We should talk about it, 'cause it's a tricky subject, kind of -- See also v. 2 and the next line in this same verse].
\q He has swallowed up all her palaces; he has destroyed her strongholds.
\q He has increased mourning and lamentation within the Daughter of Judah. ["Within" only works here if one understands "Daughter of Judah" as a territory, city--not as a metaphorical person, right?]
\q
\v 6 He has attacked his tabernacle like a garden. He has destroyed the place of the solemn assembly.
\q Yahweh has caused both solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion,
\q for he has despised both king and priest in the indignation of his anger.
