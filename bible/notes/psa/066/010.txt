===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **tested us as silver is tested**  - Silver is tested by using fire to burn away the part of the ore which is not silver. In the same way, God uses difficult circumstances to expose our sin so we can confess our sin and be made pure. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **into a net**  - A net is a trap for a bird or an animal. A net is another kind of difficulty to help us see our sins. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **a severe burden on our waists**  - A heavy load is a test of endurance. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **ride over our heads**  - Our enemies were able to defeat us. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **went through fire and water **- God tested us with natural events to expose our sin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **spacious place**  - AT: "safe place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
