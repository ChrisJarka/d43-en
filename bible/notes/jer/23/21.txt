===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jeremiah continues to deliver Yahweh's message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:09|23:9]].
  * **General Information:** - Yahweh is the speaker in verses 21-40.

  * **they have still prophesied** - It is understood that they are prophesying falsely. This can be made explicit. AT: "they have prophesied falsely anyway" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **if they had stood in my council meeting** - Yahweh states what would have happened if the priests and false prophets had participated in Yahweh's council meeting in heaven. This hypothetical situation is impossible. AT: "if they had truly listened to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
  * **my council meeting** - In ancient times, God was thought to hold meetings with the angels in heaven. Yahweh is referring to this kind of meeting, which humans could not attend. Translate this as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:23:16|23:18]].
  * **to turn from** - This idiom means they would stop doing these things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
