===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - The writer continues to describe what God did for the people of Israel.

  * **the tent of Joseph** - Here the word "tent" is a metonym for a family. In this phrase it refers to the descendants of Joseph. AT: "the descendants of Joseph" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Joseph ... Ephraim** - Ephraim was Joseph's son.
  * **Judah ... Mount Zion** - Mount Zion was in the land where the tribe of Judah lived.
  * **He built his sanctuary like the heavens** - Possible meanings for this simile are 1) Yahweh has made his sanctuary as high as the heavens. AT: "He built his sanctuary high, like the heavens" or 2) Yahweh has made his sanctuary as permanent as the heavens. AT: "He built his sanctuary to last permanently, like the heavens last forever" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **like the earth** - The verb may be supplied from the previous line. The writer compares the permanence of Yahweh's sanctuary to the permanence of the earth.
