====== Sentences ======

===== Sentence Types =====

A **//sentence//** is a group of words that express a complete thought. The basic types of sentences are:

   * **Declarative **- These are usually used to give information. '//This is a fact.//'
  * **Interrogative **- These are usually used to ask for information. '//Do you know him?//'
  * **Exclamation **- These are usually used to express a feeling. '//Ouch, that hurt!//'
  * **Imperative **  or **Command **- These are usually used to make something happen. '//Pick that up.//'
Sentences can be used for other purposes as well.

===== Sentence Structure =====

<font inherit/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>The simplest sentence structure in English includes a  //  ** subject  **  // and an  //  ** action  **  // word. '  // The boy ran.'  //</font>

==== Roles ====

The following terms are used in the explanations below:

**Actor**  - The one who does something.

**Patient**  - The one something is done to.

**Recipient**  - The one who receives something.

**Addressee**  - The one who is spoken to.

==== Subject ====

The //**subject**// is who or what the sentence is about.

Subjects are typically nouns or pronouns. (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:parts-of-speech|English Parts of Speech]] for more information.)

Sometimes a subject is not stated but is implied. For example, //'Close the door//.' The verb is 'close'; the subject is implied to be 'you.' See [[:en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]] for more information.

Usually the subject is a **noun phrase**  - //'the boy'//  It can also be a clause: //'that young boy'//; or verb phrase: //'the hard running boy'//.
==== Predicate ====

The predicate is the part of a sentence which tells something about the subject. It usually has a [[:en:ta:vocabulary:verbs|verb]]. The verb may have an object or a complement.

Here are some examples: \\ '//The man is strong//.' - the subject is '//the man//' and the predicate  is '//is strong//' (that describes the man.)\\ '//He worked hard//.' - the subject is '//he//' and the predicate is '//worked hard//' (something the man did.)

==== Clause ====

A sentence can have more than one set of subjects and predicates. Each set is called a clause. 

This is an example of a sentence that has two clauses:

'//He planted the yams and his wife planted the corn//.'\\
'//He planted the yams//' is one clause. 
'//His wife planted the corn//' is another clause.
We can use underlining to help us see the clauses.  //__He planted the yams__ and __his wife planted the corn__.//


Compound sentences are two complete sentences joined together with a comma and a conjunction (i.e. and, or, but). Example:  //He planted the yams __and__ his wife planted the corn.//

Complex sentences, which many Bible verses are, contain various components such as as phrases, clauses and/or participles. Example:</font>    //Although the boy ran very hard, he couldn't catch the fox, which disappeared into the woods.//

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Translators should use the sentence structure of the target language so that the final translation is natural. Some aspects of this include **word order **  and **clause order**. (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:wordorder|Word Order]])

For example, in English, adjectives almost always come before the noun they describe, but in French, adjectives can occur before or after the noun, depending on their type.

  * English: t//he pretty flower//
  * French: //la jolie fleur//
  * English:// the purple flower//
  * French:// la fleur violette//

Sometimes languages put an object pronoun before the verb, whereas English puts it after the verb.

  * English: //The man sees the house.//
  * French: //L'homme voit la maison. //
  * English: //The man sees it. //
  * French: //L'homme la voit. //

Languages will also differ as to how they order their clauses.
