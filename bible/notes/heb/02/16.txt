\v 16 Because \add Jesus became a human being\add*, it is not angels that he wants to help. No, it is we who trust God as Abraham did whom he wants to help.
\v 17 So, \add since he came to help humans, not angels\add*, he had to be made exactly like \add us whom he calls\add* his own brothers \add and sisters\add*. He wants to be a high priest who \add acts\add* mercifully \add to all people\add* and who acts faithfully in God's matters, so that people who had sinned would no longer be guilty.
\v 18 \add Specifically\add*, he is able to help those\f + \ft Or: us \f* who are tempted\add to sin\add*. He can do that because he suffered, and he was also tempted \add to sin like we are tempted to sin\add*.

\v 16 For truly he does not give help to angels, but instead he gives help to the seed of Abraham.
\v 17 Therefore it was necessary him to be made like his brethren in all ways so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest to God, and to pay the penal tyfor the sins of the people.
\v 18 Because he himself has been tempted, he is able to help those that are tempted.
