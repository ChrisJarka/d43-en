\v 22 Therefore, say to the Israelite people, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says: You Israelite people, it is not for your sake that I am going to do these things. Instead, it is for the sake of my sacred reputation, which you have disgraced among the nations to which you were forced to go.
\v 23 I will show that my reputation is sacred, a reputation which you have disgraced among the nations to which you were forced to go. And when I show the nations that I am holy, the people of those nations will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.

\v 22 Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I do not
this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations, whither you
went.
\v 23 And I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in the midst of
them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, says the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in you before their
eyes.
