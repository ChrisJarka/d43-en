\v 7 Though our iniquities testify against us, work you for your nameâ€™s sake, O Jehovah; for our backslidings are many; we have
sinned against thee.
\v 8 O you hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble, why should you be as a sojourner in the land, and
as a wayfaring man that turns aside to wait for a night?
\v 9 Why should you be as a man affrighted, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet you, O Jehovah, are in the midst of us,
and we are called by your name; leave us not.
