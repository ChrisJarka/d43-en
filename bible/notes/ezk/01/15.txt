===== Translation Notes: =====

  * ** there was one wheel on the ground beside the living creatures** – "there was one wheel on the ground by each one of the living creatures, one wheel for each direction the creatures faced"
  * **This was the appearance and structure of the wheels** – "This is what the wheels looked like and how they were made"
  * **each wheel was like beryl** – Ezekiel compares the wheels with beryl because their color and appearance were similar. Alternate translation: "each wheel looked like a beryl." (See: [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
  * **beryl**  - a precious stone
  * **likeness of the four**  - See how you translated this in 1:5, 1:10, and 1:13.
