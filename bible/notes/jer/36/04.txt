\v 4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which
he had spoken to him, upon a roll of a book.
\v 5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of Jehovah:
\v 6 therefore go you, and read in the roll, which you have written from my mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovahâ€™s house upon the fast-day; and also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.
