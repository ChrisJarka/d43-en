\c 11
\p
\v 1 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.
\v 2 The more the prophets called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed to the Baalim, and burned
incense to graven images.
\v 3 Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
\v 4 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I
laid food before them.
\p
\v 5 They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return
to me.
\v 6 And the sword shall fall upon their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour
them, because of their own counsels.
\v 7 And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to
him that is on high, none at all will exalt him.
\p
\v 8 How shall I give you up, Ephraim? how shall I cast you off, Israel? how shall I make you as Admah?
how shall I set you as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together.
\v 9 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy
One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath.
\v 10 They shall walk after Jehovah, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from
the west.
\v 11 They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell
in their houses, says Jehovah.
\p
\v 12 Ephraim encircles me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet rules with God, and is
faithful with the Holy One.
