===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Who is a God like you—who takes ... inheritance?** - Micah is emphasizing that there is no God like Yahweh. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I know that there is no God like you, who takes ... inheritance." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the remnant of his inheritance** - "those of his chosen people who have survived his punishment "
  * **you—who takes away sin, who passes over the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? He does not keep his anger forever, because he delights in his covenant faithfulness.** - Because the one who does not keep his anger and delights in covenant faithfulness is also the one who takes away sin and passes over transgression, other possible translations are 1) "you, who take away sin, who pass over the transgression of the remnant of your inheritance, who do not keep your anger forever, because you delight in your covenant faithfulness?" and 2) "you, who take away sin, who pass over the transgression of the remnant of your inheritance? You do not keep your anger forever, because you delights in your covenant faithfulness." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
  * **passes over** - ignores
  * **does not keep his anger** - "does not stay angry"
