====== Acts 16 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== They "circumcised him" ==
This was not done in an attempt to follow the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]], but was done because he was ministering in a Jewish context.

== Divination and Fortunetelling ==
These action were against the law of Moses and were considered to be [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sinful]]. This is probably one of the reasons why Paul rebuked this woman, even though she was telling the truth.
