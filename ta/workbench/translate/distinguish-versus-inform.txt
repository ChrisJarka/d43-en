======Distinguishing versus Informing or Reminding ======

This module answers the question: When a phrase is used with a noun, what is the difference between phrases that distinguish the noun from others and phrases that simply inform or remind? \\ 

In order to understand this module, it would be good to read:
  * [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_partsofspeech]]

In some languages, phrases can be used with a noun for two different things. They can either distinguish one item from another or they can give more information about an item. 

  * “Mary gave some of the food to her sister __who was very thankful__. 
    *If her sister was usually thankful, the underlined phrase could distinguish this sister from another sister who was not usually thankful.

  * “Mary gave some of the food to her sister, __who was very thankful__.” 
    * This same phrase can be used to inform us about how Mary's sister responded when Mary gave her the food. In this case it does not distinguish one sister from another.

===== Description ===== 
In some languages, phrases can be used with a noun for two different things. They can either distinguish one item from another or they can give more information about an item. Sometimes the added information is new information to the reader, and some times it is a reminder of something the reader would already know or assume. 
 
"Mary gave some of the food to her sister __who was very thankful__. \\ 
If her sister was usually thankful, the underlined phrase could distinguish this sister of Mary's from another sister who was not usually thankful.  
 
"Mary gave some of the food to her sister, __who was very thankful__." \\ 
This same phrase can be used to inform us about how Mary's sister responded when Mary gave her the food. In this case it is not distinguishing one sister from another. 
 
**Reasons this is a translation issue** \\  
  * Some languages can use phrases with a noun both to distinguish and to give more information.  
  * Other languages use phrases with a noun only for distinguishing. When people who speak these languages hear a phrase with a noun, they assume that its function is to distinguish one item from another. 
 
===== Examples from the Bible ===== 
Examples of words and phrases that are used to distinguish one item from other possible items.  These usually do not cause a problem in translation. 
 
  * **The curtain is to separate the holy place from the most holy place.** (Exodus 26:33) 
    *The words "holy" and "most holy" distinguish two different places from each other and from any other place. 
 
  * **A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to the woman who bore him.** (Proverbs 17:25) 
    * The phrase "who bore him" distinguishes which woman the son is bitterness to. 
 
Examples of words and phrases that are used to give added information or a reminder about an item. These are a translation issue for languages that do not use these. (See: [[Phrases that Inform or Remind]]) 
 
  * **for your righteous judgments are good.**  (Psalm 119:39) \\   
    * The word "righteous" simple shows that God's judgments are good. It does not distinguish his righteous judgement from his unrighteous judgement because all of his judgments are good.
 
  * **Can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a son?** - (Genesis 17:17-18)  \\ 
    * The phrase "who is ninety years old"  is a reminder of Sarah's age.  It tells why Abraham was asking the question. He did not expect that a  woman who was that old could bear a child.
