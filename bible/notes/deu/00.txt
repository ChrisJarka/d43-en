====== Introduction to Deuteronomy ======

===== Part 1: General Introduction =====

**Outline of Deuteronomy**\\

  


**Who wrote Deuteronomy?**\\

Moses wrote Deuteronomy in approximately 1407-1406 B.C.  His character is revealed in Deuteronomy, and he is very much the man we know from previous books. We see his zeal and bold leadership (Exodus 2:12, 13 and Deuteronomy 9:21ff), the impact of his early training in Egypt (Acts 7:22), and, perhaps the most obvious, that he was a devoted “servant of Yahweh” (Deuteronomy 34:5). 
 

However, it is widely assumed that Chapter 34 and the matters dealing with Moses’ death or events occurring after Moses’ death were compiled or written by Joshua. As in other books of the Pentateuch, ancient place-names were often updated during copying (“transmission”), and were changed to names known by later readers, for the purpose of clarity.


**What are the different parts of Leviticus?**\\ 

In the first four chapters Moses encourages the Israelites to obey the laws of God after reminding them of the Exodus and their journey of the wilderness.

From chapters 5 through 28, Moses repeats the Ten Commandments to the Israelites and gives details about the meaning of the law and the importance of obeying the law, as well as putting God first as his chosen people. He promised Yahweh’s blessings on those who obey and his judgment on those who disobey.

In the last chapters, Moses blesses the tribes of Israel and appoints Joshua as his successor. Before he dies, God also shows him the promise land, although he is not allowed to enter it.
