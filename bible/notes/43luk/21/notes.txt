====== Notes on Luke 21 ======

Luke 21:30: the interpretation and translation of “summer”. The UBS manual, SIL’s Translator’s Notes and even Nida’s Semantics Domains book all got it wrong, and did not take the time to thoroughly research what summer was like in Israel. For languages that do not have the summer that Europeans and North Americans know, these helps suggested saying ‘rainy season’, which is a completely false notion, since summer in Israel is actually dry season and very hot! Crops do not grow during that time, but are actually harvested at the beginning of summer. It is also time of fruit maturing – like figs and grapes. The fig tree buds towards the end of rainy season, and when the leaves come out, the first figs also begin forming the same time. Here is the verse: 29 Then he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees; 30 as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near. So when the fig leaves come out it is a sign that harvest/dry season is already near.
