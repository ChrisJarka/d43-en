\v 35 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah:
\v 36 Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your whoredoms
with your lovers; and because of all the idols of your abominations, and for the blood of your children, that you did give to
them;
\v 37 therefore behold, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all them that you have loved,
with all them that you have hated; I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to
them, that they may see all your nakedness.
