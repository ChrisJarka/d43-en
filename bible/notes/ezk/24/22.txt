===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 When that happens, you will do like I have done: you will not cover the lower part of your faces, or eat the kinds of food that people who are mourning usually eat.
\v 23 You will keep your turbans wrapped around your heads and keep your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or cry, but your bodies will become very thin and slowly die because of your sins. And you will groan to each other.
\v 24 Ezekiel will be a warning to you, and you must do what he has done. When that happens, you will know that I, Yahweh the Lord \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.'

\v 22 And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
\v 23 And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: you shall not mourn nor weep; but you shall pine
away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.
\v 24 Thus shall Ezekiel be to you a sign; according to all that he has done shall you do: when this cometh, then shall you
know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
