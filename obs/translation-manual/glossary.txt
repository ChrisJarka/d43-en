===== Glossary =====
This page is a glossary of important terms for unfoldingWord translation projects.

==== Checking Level ====
A Checking Level refers to the three-level iterative checking scale that shows the extent to which the accuracy of a translation has been corroborated. The checking levels used on Door43 have been developed by unfoldingWord and are outlined in the [[http://distantshores.org/resources/whitepapers/quality-assurance|Quality Assurance Document]]. All three checking levels compare the translation to the source text, translation notes, Statement of Faith, and Translation Guidelines.

==== Gateway Languages Strategy ==== 
a strategy developed by unfoldingWord to equip 100% of the people groups that comprise the global Church with biblical content that is released from copyright restrictions and made available in a language they understand well (a language of wider communication) together with unrestricted translation training and tools that enable them to translate it into a language they understand fully (their own language). This strategy is outlined in more detail [[http://distantshores.org/resources/whitepapers/gateway-languages-strategy|here]].
