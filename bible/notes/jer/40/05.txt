\v 5 And when he had not yet returned, “Return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan who the king of Babylon appointed over the cities of Judah and dwell with him 
in the midst of the city, or go wherever it is good in your eyes to go.” Then the chief guard gave him provision and a tribute, and sent him out.
\v 6 So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, to Mitzpah, and he dwelt with him in the city of those remaining in the land.
