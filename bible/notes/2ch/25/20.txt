<usfm>
\v 20 But Amaziah refused to heed Jehoash's message. That happened because God wanted Jehoash's army to defeat them, because they were worshiping the gods of Edom.
\v 21 So Jehoash's army attacked. Their two armies faced each other at Beth-Shemesh \add city\add* in Judah.
\v 22 The army of Judah was badly defeated by the army of Israel, and all the soldiers of Judah fled to their homes.

\v 20 But Amaziah would not listen, because this event was from God, so he might hand over the people of Judah into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought advice from the gods of Edom.
\v 21 So Jehoash, king of Israel, attacked; he and Amaziah, king of Judah, met each other face to face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
\v 22 Judah was struck down before Israel, and every man fled home.

  * [[:en:obe:other:bethshemesh]]

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **this event was from God** - "God wanted this event to happen"
  * **into the hand of their enemies** - Here "hand" refers to power to defeat. AT: "into the power of their enemies" or "so their enemies could defeat them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **met each other face to face** - This idiom means they were both at the battle in person, rather than only sending other people to fight. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:25:17|25:17]]. AT: "met each other in person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah** - The city of Beth Shemesh was located in Judah.
  * **Judah was struck down before Israel** - Here "Judah" and "Israel" are metonyms for the soldiers of Judah and Israel, and "struck down" is an idiom that means "defeated." This can be stated in active form. AT: "The soldiers of Israel defeated the soldiers of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **every man** - This is a generalization that refers to the soldiers of Judah who survived the battle. AT: "the surviving soldiers of Judah" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
