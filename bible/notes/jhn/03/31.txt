The one who comes from heaven is above everyone on the earth and everything there is.
\v 32 One here now bears withness to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony as true.
\v 33 Those who have accepted what he has said do here with a solemn oath now bear witness that God is the source of all truth and the measure and standard of everything that is true.

\v 31 He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that
comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 What he has seen and heard, of that he bears witness; and no man receiveth his witness.
\v 33 He that has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.
