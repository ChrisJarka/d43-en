So\add* John had been saying to him, "\add What\add* you \add did by\add* marrying \add your brother's wife while your brother is still alive is against God's\add* law!" Then, to \add please\add* Herodias, Herod \add told his soldiers\add* to arrest John. They bound him with chains and put him in prison.
\v 5 Herod wanted to have John executed, but he was afraid that the people \add who had accepted what John taught would riot if he did that\add*, because they believed that John was a prophet.

\v 3-4 This is what happened to make Herod think this. Herod had married Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, while Philip was still living. So John kept saying to him, "What you have done is against God's law!" Then, to please Herodias, Herod told his soldiers to arrest John. They bound him with chains and put him in prison.
\v 5 Herod wanted to order his men to execute John, but he was afraid of the general public, because they believed that John was a prophet speaking for God.

\v 3 For Herod had laid hold upon John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
\v 4 For John had said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her as your wife."
\v 5 Herod would have put him to death, but he feared the people, because they regarded him as a prophet.
