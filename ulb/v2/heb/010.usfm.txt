\c 10
\p
\v 1 For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the
same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that draw nigh.
\v 2 Else would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more
consciousness of sins.
\v 3 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.
\v 4 For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
\v 5 Wherefore when he comes into the world, he saith,
\q Sacrifice and offering you would not,
\q But a body did you prepare for me;
\q
\v 6 In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you had no pleasure:
\q
\v 7 Then said I, Lo, I am come (In the roll of the book it is written of me)
\q To do your will, O God.
\p
\v 8 Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and
sacrifices for sin you would not, neither had pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law),
\v 9 then has he said, Lo, I am come to do your will. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.
\v 10 By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
\v 11 And every priest indeed stands day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never
take away sins:
\v 12 but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
\v 13 henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.
\v 14 For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
\v 15 And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after he has said,
\q
\v 16 This is the covenant that I will make with them
\q After those days, says the Lord:
\q I will put my laws on their heart,
\q And upon their mind also will I write them;
\p then says he,
\q
\v 17 And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
\p
\v 18 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
\p
\v 19 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
\v 20 by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
\v 21 and having a great priest over the house of God;
\v 22 let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having
our body washed with pure water,
\v 23 let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised:
\v 24 and let us consider one another to provoke to love and good works;
\v 25 not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting
one another; and so much the more, as you see the day drawing nigh.
\p
\v 26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for
sins,
\v 27 but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries.
\v 28 A man that has set at nothing Mosesâ€™ law dieth without compassion on
the word of two or three witnesses:
\v 29 of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has
counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?
\v 30 For we know him that said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
\v 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
\p
\v 32 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings;
\v 33 partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that were
so used.
\v 34 For you both had compassion on them that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your possessions, knowing that
you have for yourselves a better possession and an living one.
\v 35 Cast not away therefore your boldness, which has great recompense of reward.
\v 36 For you have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.
\q
\v 37 For yet a very little while,
\q He that comes shall come, and shall not tarry.
\q
\v 38 But my righteous one shall live by faith:
\q And if he shrink back, my soul has no pleasure in him.
\p
\v 39 But we are not of them that shrink back to perdition; but of them that have faith to the saving of the soul.
