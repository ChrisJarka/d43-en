A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant, embarrassing, or considered to be socially unacceptable, such as death or activities usually done in private. Its purpose is to avoid offending the people who hear or read it. 

===== Description =====

A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant, embarrassing, or considered to be socially unacceptable. Its purpose is to avoid offending the people who hear or read it.

**Saul and his sons fallen** - "Saul and his sons dead" (1 Chronicles 1:8)\\
This is euphemism because the important thing was not that Saul and his sons had fallen but that they were dead. Sometimes people do not like to speak directly about death because death is unpleasant.

**Reason this is a translation issue**\\
Readers may think that the writer means only what the words literally say.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**where there was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet** (1 Samuel 24:3)\\
The original hearers would have understood that Saul went into the cave to empty his intestines, but the writer wanted to avoid offending or distracting them, so he does not mention body parts or what came out.

**whether we are awake or asleep** - "whether we are alive or dead" (1 Thessalonians 5:10)\\
Paul refers to being dead as being "asleep" so that instead of thinking that they will never see their loved ones again in this life, his readers will remember that they will see them again when Jesus establishes his kingdom.

===== Translation Strategies =====
If euphemism would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here are other options:
  - Use a euphemism from your own culture.
  - State the information plainly without a euphemism if it would not be offensive.

===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. Use a euphemism from your own culture.
  * **where there was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet** (1 Samuel 24:3) If the readers would not understand that Saul was going in to empty his intestines, but the first thing most readers think of when they hear the words "little house" is a place for people to empty their intestines, this is a possibility:
    * "where there was a cave; and Saul went in to use the cave as a little house" 

2. State the information plainly without a euphemism if it would not be offensive.
  * **whether we are awake or asleep** (1 Thessalonians 5:10)
    * "whether we are alive or dead"
