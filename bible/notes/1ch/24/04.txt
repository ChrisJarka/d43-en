\v 4 And there were more leading men among  the descendants of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; so they divided of the descendants of Eleazar  into sixteen groups by heads of families and of the descendants of
Ithamar, corresponding to their families, eight groups.

the descendants of Eleazar, and of the descendants of Ithamar.
