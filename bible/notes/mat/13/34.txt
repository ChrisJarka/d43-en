\v 34 All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and without parables he said nothing to them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

  * **All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and without parables he said nothing to them** - This is a doublet. The second phrase expresses nearly the same idea. (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
  * **All these things** - This refers to what was taught to the crowds with the help of parables.
  * **without parables he said nothing to them** - "he taught them nothing except by a parable" 
  * **what had been said through the prophet when he said **- This can be translated with an active verb: "what God told one of the prophets to write long ago" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **when he said** - "when the prophet said" 
  * **I will open my mouth in parables; I will say things that were hidden from the foundation of the world** - This quote from the book of Psalms expresses two related ideas in parallel form. (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]])
  * **I will open my mouth** - This is an idiom that means "I will speak." (See: [[en:ta:translate:Idiom]])
  * **I will say things that were hidden from the foundation of the world** - This can be translated with an active verb: "I will say things that God has kept hidden since he created the world".(See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **from the foundation of the world** - "since the beginning of the world" or "since the world was created."
