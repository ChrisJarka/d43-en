===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **when all denied**  - That is, "when everyone denied" or "when no one admitted."
    * **Master **  - This refers to someone who has been put in charge over a group of people, and not someone who owns someone else. It is a different word than is usually translated as “Master” and does not have the same level of authority. You may want to translate it as “Boss” or “Foreman.”
    * **intentionally touch me**  - That is, "deliberately touch me" or "specifically touch me." This a touching that alters another or causes them to take notice.
