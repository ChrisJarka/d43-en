===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **had marital relations - “had sex with.” Your language may have a way of saying this politely. Some languages say “knew” or “slept with.” (See: Euphemism). See how you translated this in 4:1.
  * **and said, "God has given me another son**  - This is the reason that she named Seth. This implicit information could be made explicit: "and explained, 'God has given me another child.'"
  * **Seth**  - Translators may add a footnote that says "This name sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'has given'."
  * **in the place of Abel**  -
  * **A son was born to Set**  - This can be translated as "Seth had a son"
  * **to call upon the name of Yahweh**  - “to pray in the name of Yahweh” or “to trust in the name of Yahweh” or “worship Yahweh”
