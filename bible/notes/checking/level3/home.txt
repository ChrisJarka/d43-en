====== Level 3 Checking (Recognized Organization) ======

The topics to be validated in this check include:

  * The translator understands the target language and culture and the source language
  * The community believes translation is clear, accurate, and natural
  * The book translated with the faithful use of the notes?
  * Is the book translated in a style and level that is appropriate for the audience?
  * Does the translation handle difficult passages well?
  * Are there any doctrinal errors in the translation?

Each of these topics will be described in more detail.
