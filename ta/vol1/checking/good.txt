Level Two Church Affirmation
We, the leaders of the church groups in our language community, affirm the following: 

  - The translation conforms to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines.
  - The translation is accurate and clear in the target language.
  - The translation uses an acceptable style of the language.
  - The translation uses an appropriate alphabet and system of spelling.
  - The community approves of the translation.

If there are any remaining problems, make a note of them here for the attention of the Level Three Checkers.
