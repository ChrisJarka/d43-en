\c 118
\q
\v 1 Oh give thanks to Jehovah; for he is good;
\q For his lovingkindness endures for ever.
\q
\v 2 Let Israel now say,
\q That his lovingkindness endures for ever.
\q
\v 3 Let the house of Aaron now say,
\q That his lovingkindness endures for ever.
\q
\v 4 Let them now that fear Jehovah say,
\q That his lovingkindness endures for ever.
\q
\v 5 Out of my distress I called upon Jehovah:
\q Jehovah answered me and set me in a large place.
\q
\v 6 Jehovah is on my side; I will not fear:
\q What can man do to me?
\q
\v 7 Jehovah is on my side among them that help me:
\q Therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.
\q
\v 8 It is better to take refuge in Jehovah
\q Than to put confidence in man.
\q
\v 9 It is better to take refuge in Jehovah
\q Than to put confidence in princes.
\q
\v 10 All nations compassed me about:
\q In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.
\q
\v 11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about:
\q In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.
\q
\v 12 They compassed me about like bees;
\q They are quenched as the fire of thorns:
\q In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.
\q
\v 13 You did thrust sore at me that I might fall;
\q But Jehovah helped me.
\q
\v 14 Jehovah is my strength and song;
\q And he is become my salvation.
\q
\v 15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous:
\q The right hand of Jehovah does valiantly.
\q
\v 16 The right hand of Jehovah is exalted:
\q The right hand of Jehovah does valiantly.
\q
\v 17 I shall not die, but live,
\q And declare the works of Jehovah.
\q
\v 18 Jehovah has chastened me sore;
\q But he has not given me over to death.
\q
\v 19 Open to me the gates of righteousness:
\q I will enter into them, I will give thanks to Jehovah.
\q
\v 20 This is the gate of Jehovah;
\q The righteous shall enter into it.
\q
\v 21 I will give thanks to thee; for you have answered me,
\q And are become my salvation.
\q
\v 22 The stone which the builders rejected
\q Is become the head of the corner.
\q
\v 23 This is Jehovahâ€™s doing;
\q It is marvelous in our eyes.
\q
\v 24 This is the day which Jehovah has made;
\q We will rejoice and be glad in it.
\q
\v 25 Save now, we beseech thee, O Jehovah:
\q O Jehovah, we beseech thee, send now prosperity.
\q
\v 26 Blessed be he that comes in the name of Jehovah:
\q We have blessed you out of the house of Jehovah.
\q
\v 27 Jehovah is God, and he has given us light:
\q Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.
\q
\v 28 You are my God, and I will give thanks to thee:
\q You are my God, I will exalt thee.
\q
\v 29 Oh give thanks to Jehovah; for he is good;
\q For his lovingkindness endures for ever.
