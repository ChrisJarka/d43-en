\v 26 But \add God\add* did not send Elijah to \add help\add* any of those \add Jewish\add* widows. \add God sent him\add* to Zarepath \add town\add* near Sidon \add city\add*, to \add help\add* a \add non-Jewish\add* widow.
\v 27 There were also many \add Jewish\add* lepers in Israel during the time when the prophet Elisha \add lived\add*. But \add Elisha\add* did not heal any of them. He healed only Naaman, a \add non-Jewish\add* man from Syria."

\v 25 But think about this: There were many widows in Israel during the time when the prophet Elijah lived, when there was a great famine throughout the country because there had been no rain for three and half years.
\v 26 But God did not send Elijah to help any of those Jewish widows. God sent him to the town of Zarepath near the city of Sidon, to help a non-Jewish widow.
\v 27 There were also many Jewish lepers in Israel during the time when the prophet Elisha lived. But Elisha did not heal any of them. He healed only Naaman, a non-Jewish man from Syria."

\v 25 But I say to you in truth that there were many widows in Israel during Elijah's time, when the sky was shut up, with no rain, for three and a half years, when there was a great famine over all the land. 
\v 26 But Elijah was not sent to any of them, but only to a widow living in Zarephath near the city of Sidon. 
\v 27 There were also many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, but none of them was healed except Naaman the Syrian."
