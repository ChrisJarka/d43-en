===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 19 So, my fellow believers, because we trust in what Jesus accomplished when his own blood flowed for us, we can confidently go into God's very presence that was symbolized by the very holy place in the sacred tent. \v 20 He has enabled us to go into God's presence by making a new way in which we can live forever. This new way is Jesus, who died for us. \v 21 Christ is a great priest who rules over us, we who are God's people. \v 22 So we must approach God sincerely by confidently trusting in Jesus. It is he who has made our hearts pure from having sinned. It is as if he sprinkled his own blood over our hearts, and as if he had washed our bodies in pure water. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 19 Therefore, brothers, we have confidence to enter into the most holy place by Jesus' blood. \v 20 That is the way that he has opened for us by those who are sanctified, a new and living way through the curtain. \v 21 And because we have a great priest over the house of God, \v 22 let us draw near with a true heart in the full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and having our body washed with pure water. </usfm>
