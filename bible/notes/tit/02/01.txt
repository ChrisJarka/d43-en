===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 But you, Titus, you must teach the things that help people believe the truth about God. 


But you Titus, I want you to speak about things that flow naturally from our teaching about Jesus. In other words, I want you to encourage among our people a lifestyle that is both physically and spiritually healthy. Things like this:
\v 2 The older men should control themselves all the time. They should live in a way that other people respect, and they should speak wisely. They should also believe the true things about God, love others truly, and continuously do these things.  

Older men should act their age and not waste peopleâ€™s time and talk about things that do not matter. In other words, they should be thoughtful about life and inspire the respect of younger people. Even though they are old, and especially because they are old, they can show others how to persevere in believing and doing the right things, and how to love those around them.
