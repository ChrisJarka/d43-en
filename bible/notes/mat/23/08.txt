<usfm>
\v 8 But you \add who are my disciples\add* should not allow people to address you \add honorably\add* as 'Rabbi', \add which means 'teacher\add*'. I \add am the\add* only one who is \add really\add* your teacher, which means that you are all \add equal, like\add* brothers and sisters, \add and none of you should act superior to another, as the Pharisees do\add*.
\v 9 Do not \add honor anyone\add* on earth \add by\add* addressing him as 'Father', because God, your Father in heaven, is the only \add spiritual\add* father of all of you.
\v 10 Do not \add allow people to\add* call you 'Instructors', because I, the Messiah, am the one instructor who\add teaches all of\add* you.

even he who is in heaven.
