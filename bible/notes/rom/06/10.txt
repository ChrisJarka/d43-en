===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 10 When he died, he died once for people who had sinned, and he will never die again; but because he lives again, he lives in order to serve God. \v 11 In the same way, you must view yourselves as God views you: you are dead people, unable to sin any longer, but you are also living people, living to worship God and joined to Christ Jesus. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 10 For the death that he died he died once for all, but the life that he lives, he lives for God. \v 11 Thus also you: consider yourselves to be dead to sin on the one hand, but on the other hand, alive to God in Christ Jesus. </usfm>
