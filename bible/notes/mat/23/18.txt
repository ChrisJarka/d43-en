\v 18 Also \add you say\add*, 'In the case of those who promise to \add do\add* something and then ask \add the altar to affirm what they have promised\add*, it means nothing \add if they do not do what they have promised\add*. But if they ask the gift \add that\add* they have put on the altar \add to support what they have promised\add*, they must do \add what they promised\add*.'
\v 19 \add You are like people who are\add* blind \f + \ft metaphor \f*. The gift \add that is offered\add* on the altar is important, but the altar is even more important \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* because it is the altar on which the offering is offered that sets it apart for a special use for God.

\v 18 Also you say, 'In the case of those who promise to do something and then ask the altar to affirm what they have promised, it means nothing if they do not do what they have promised. But if they ask the gift that they have put on the altar to support what they have promised, they must do what they promised.'
\v 19 You are like people who are blind. The gift that is offered on the altar is important, but the altar is even more important because it is the altar on which the offering is offered that sets it apart for a special use for God.

debtor.
