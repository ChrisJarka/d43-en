\v 13 And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
\v 14 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because that he wholly
followed Jehovah, the God of Israel.
\v 15 Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba; which Arba was
the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
