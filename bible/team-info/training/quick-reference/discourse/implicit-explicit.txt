====== Implicit and Explicit Information ======

===== Description =====

There are two different forms of communication found in both written and spoken messages. One is called **//explicit//** and the other //**implicit**//. The speaker, or writer, has a particular audience in mind as he gives the message. This affects the form of his message and his decision on what information to include or leave out.
   * A message with all information included is **explicit**,
  * A message that leaves out information but is still understood is **implicit**.

===== Template =====

Create notes as follows:

  - List the phrase from the ULB in bold where the implicit information should appear
  - Identify the content of the implicit information
  - Suggest translation alternative with information made explicit
  - Add TA Link

  * **phrase**  - Implicit content. Explicit translation suggestion. (See: Explicit and Implicit Information)
===== Bible Examples =====

=== Act:15:19 ===

"Therefore, my opinion is, that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God; "

  * **we should not trouble those of the Gentiles**  - "we should not require the gentiles to become circumcised and obey the laws of Moses" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
=== Gen:16:15 ===

"Hagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael."

  * **Hagar gave birth**  - Hagar's return to Sarai and Abram is implict. You can make this more explicit: "So Hagar went back and gave birth." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]]).
=== Luk:23:17 ===

"Now Pilate was obligated to release to the Jews one prisoner at the feast. "

  * **he was obligated to release to them one prisoner**  - Pilate was required to do this by political custom. This implied information can be stated explicitly: "he was obligated by custom to release to them one prisoner." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
