    * **as I have intended, so it will come to pass; and as I have purposed, so it will be** - This is saying the same thing in two ways for emphasis. It can be translated as, "he things that I have planned will surely happen." (See: Doublet)
    * **I will break the Assyrian in my land** - This is referring to the army of Assyria in Yahweh's land of Israel.
    * **Then his yoke  will  be lifted from off them** - This is figure of speech that compares the "yoke being lifted" to the freedom of the slaves of Assyria and can be translated as, "My people will no longer be the slaves of the people of Assyria." (See: Metaphor)
    * **and his burden from off their shoulder** - This is also a figure of speech intended to compare "taking the heavy burdens off of their shoulders to freeing the people of Israel from their bondage to Assyria and can be translated as, "It will be as though I will take away the burdens that are on their shoulders."
