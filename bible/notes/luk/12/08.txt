\v 8 I want to tell you also that if people, without being afraid, are willing to tell others that they are my disciples, I, the one who came from heaven, will acknowledge before God that they are my disciples. I will do that while God's angels listen.
\v 9 But if they are afraid to say in front of others that they are my disciples, I will say while God's angels listen, that they are not my disciples.
\v 10 I will tell you also that God is willing to forgive people who say bad things about me, the one who came from heaven, but he will not forgive anyone who says evil things about what the Holy Spirit does.

\v 8 And I say to you, Every one who shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of
God:
\v 9 but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of God.
\v 10 And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven.
