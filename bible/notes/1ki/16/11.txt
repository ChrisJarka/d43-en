\v 11 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he struck all the house of Baasha: he left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
\v 12 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
\v 13 for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and wherewith they made Israel to sin, to
provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
