===== Translation Notes: =====
Elihu continues speaking.
  * **If you have sinned, what harm do you do to God?** - Elihu uses a question to state that when a person sins it does not harm God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **If your transgressions pile up high, what do you do to him?** - This means basically the same thing as the previous question. The phrase "transgressions pile up high" means the person sins many times. Elihu is stating that even many sins do not harm God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **If you are righteous, what can you give to him? What will he receive from your hand?** - Elihu continues using questions to challenge Job. Both of these mean basically the same thing. Elihu means that even if a person is righteous he still has nothing to give God that would help him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **from your hand** - AT: "from you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **son of man** - "man" or "person"
