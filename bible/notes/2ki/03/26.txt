\v 26 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword,
to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.
\v 27 Then he took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall.
And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.
