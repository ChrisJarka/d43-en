\v 10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat.
\v 11 For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies.
\v 12 Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
