===== The Field Recording Environment =====

This module answers the question: What is a field recording environment?\\
=== ===

We consider field recording to be recording projects done outside of a permanent room dedicated and designed for the purpose of audio recording. This would include the traditional sense of recording in a remote location, but would also include any temporary setup by a recordist to create a quality recording environment where a suitable one did not exist.
     
It is the our belief that field recording is how most recording of Biblical content will need to be done due to the high project costs and logistical constraints of utilizing established, professionally designed studios. Much more effective in every way is field recording done by skilled, mobile, adaptable team. A good field recording team is able to enable recordings to happen where they need to happen.

**Skills & Ingenuity**

Often field recording requires much in the way of skills and ingenuity of the recording team, especially the recordist. The recordist needs to be able to assess the existing recording environment, detect elements that will negatively impact quality and identify locally-available solution that will mitigate issues and help quality. In order to do this effectively the recordist needs to have a solid understanding of the behavior of sound waves in an environment and how to treat or avoid common issues.

**Simplicity**

Keeping the recording process and equipment setup simple is one of the smartest decisions that can be made in field recording. A simple kit of gear means is easy to maintain, easy to setup, and there is less chance for problems, errors or delays. Skill at knowing how to use that gear very well will produce better results than having fancy gadgets. 

**Adaptability**

Adaptability is as much a resilient attitude as it is the ability to be flexible in the physical conditions. With proper skills-training and a simple gear setup, it is easier to be adaptive when circumstances change and Plan A is no longer viable. The ability to create and adapt to Plan B or C can often be necessary in field recording.

Advantages of a field recording can be:

  * Recording can be done in the best location possible considering all factors of project, typically a that simplifies logistics and reduces costs.
  * Ability to record at or near where language is spoken can make the difference in being able to record or not (cost and cultural advantages).
  * A team is assembled for the specific project, which can help increase focus and intentionality
  * Intentionality of recordist to select optimal equipment may lead to an easier recording of better quality
  * Intentionality of recordist to analyze and treat acoustical challenges can create an environment equal or better than any studio alternatives.

Disadvantages of studio recording can be:

  * Nearly every factor of recording becomes a variable that the recordist must find a solution for.
  * Some locations can be extremely challenging to find an environment quiet enough for recoding.
  * There may be need to setup and pack away equipment and workspace every day, which reduces time spent recording.
