\v 16 and the damsel’s father shall say to the elders, I gave my daughter to this man to wife, and he hates her;
\v 17 and, lo, he has laid shameful things to her charge, saying, I found not in your daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.
