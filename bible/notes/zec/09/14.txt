<usfm>
\v 14 One day Yahweh will appear in the sky above his people, and the arrows that he shoots will be like lightning bolts. Yahweh our Lord will blow his trumpet, and he will march with the powerful storms that come from the land of Teman in the south.
\v 15 Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, will protect his people; the soldiers of Judah will attack and defeat their enemies who attack them using slings and stones. Those soldiers of Judah will drink and celebrate and shout like people who are drunk; they will be as full of wine as the bowl that holds the blood of the animals priest kill at the altarâ€”the blood that the priests sprinkle on the corners of the altar.

<usfm>
\v 14 Yahweh will appear to them, and his arrows will shoot out like lightning! For my Lord Yahweh will blow the
trumpet and will advance with the storms from Teman.
\v 15 Yahweh of hosts will defend them, and they will devour them and defeat the stones of the slings. Then they will drink
and shout like men drunk on wine, and they will be filled with wine like bowls, like the corners of the altar.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - In verses 14-16, Zechariah describes how Yahweh will rescue Israel from their enemies.

  * **will appear to them** - The word "them" refers to God's people. AT: "will be seen in the sky by his people" or "will come to his people"
  * **his arrows will shoot out like lightning!** - The Israelites sometimes thought of lightning bolts as arrows that God shot. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **blow the trumpet** - The trumpets were rams' horns. People blew into them to give signals in battle and on other occasions. Here the trumpet is blown as a military signal.
  * **will advance with the storms from Teman** - Team was located to the south of Judah. The Israelites sometimes thought of God as traveling on violent storms coming from the south. AT: "will march from Teman with the storm winds"
  * **they will devour them** - "the people of Judah will devour their enemies"
  * **will devour** - To completely defeat enemies is spoken of as devouring them as a wild animal eats its prey. AT: "will completely defeat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **defeat the stones of the slings** - Slings to throw stones were a common weapon in the days of Zechariah. Here the "stones of the slings" represent the soldiers who were using them to attack Israel. AT: "defeat the enemies who attack them with slings and stones" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Then they will drink and shout like men drunk on wine** - The people of Judah will shout and celebrate their victory over their enemies as if they were noisy drunks. AT: "Then they will shout and celebrate their victory as loudly as if they were drunk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **they will be filled with wine like bowls** - This probably refers to the bowls that the priests used to carry animal's blood to the altar. AT: "they will be as full of wine as the basins with which priests carry blood to the altar" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **like the corners of the altar** - Altars had projecting corners that were drenched in animal blood. AT: "as the corners of the altar are covered in blood" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
