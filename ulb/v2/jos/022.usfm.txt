\p
\v 1 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
\v 2 and said to them, You have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, and have listened to my voice in
all that I commanded you:
\v 3 you have not left your brethren these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah your
God.
\v 4 And now Jehovah your God has given rest to your brethren, as he spoke to them: therefore now turn ye, and get you
to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan.
\v 5 Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, to love
Jehovah your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all
your heart and with all your soul.
\v 6 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went to their tents.
\p
\v 7 Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance
in Bashan; but to the other half gave Joshua among their brethren beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua sent
them away to their tents, he blessed them,
\v 8 and spoke to them, saying, Return with much wealth to your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with
gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
\v 9 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children
of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession,
whereof they were possessed, according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.
\p
\v 10 And when they came to the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the
children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look upon.
\v 11 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of
Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that
pertaineth to the children of Israel.
\v 12 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves
together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.
\p
\v 13 And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of
Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
\v 14 and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers’ house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of
them head of their fathers’ houses among the thousands of Israel.
\v 15 And they came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land
of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,
\v 16 Thus says the whole congregation of Jehovah, What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to
turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that you have builded you an altar, to rebel this day against Jehovah?
\v 17 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came a
plague upon the congregation of Jehovah,
\v 18 that you must turn away this day from following Jehovah? and it will be, seeing you rebel today against Jehovah, that
to-morrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
\v 19 Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass you over to the land of the possession of Jehovah, wherein
Jehovah’s tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, in building
you an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God.
\v 20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of
Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
\p
\v 21 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of
the thousands of Israel,
\v 22 The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, the Mighty One, God, Jehovah, he knoweth; and Israel he shall know: if it be in rebellion,
or if in trespass against Jehovah (save you us not this day),
\v 23 that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Jehovah; or if to offer thereon burnt offering or
meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings thereon, let Jehovah himself require it;
\v 24 and if we have not rather out of carefulness done this,
and of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with
Jehovah, the God of Israel?
\v 25 for Jehovah has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no
portion in Jehovah: so might your children make our children cease from fearing Jehovah.
\v 26 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice:
\v 27 but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Jehovah
before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to
our children in time to come, You have no portion in Jehovah.
\v 28 Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold
the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness
between us and you.
\v 29 Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, and turn away this day from following Jehovah, to build an altar
for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle.
\p
\v 30 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were
with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased
them well.
\v 31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the
children of Manasseh, This day we know that Jehovah is in the midst of us, because you have not committed this trespass against
Jehovah: now have you delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.
\v 32 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children
of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
\v 33 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up
against them to war, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt.
\v 34 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar
Ed: For, said they, it is a witness between us that Jehovah is God.
