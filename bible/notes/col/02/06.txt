\v 6 In a way that is consistent\f + \ft Or: in harmony \f* with \add the message that\add* you received about Christ Jesus, who is our Lord, conduct yourselves as you should, since you have a close relationship with such a one as he is.
\v 7 Specifically, continue believing and practicing \f + \ft metaphor, doublet \f* what you were first taught about Christ. Continue to do this more and more; continue to be sure about all the true teaching, just like \add Epaphras\add* taught it to you.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 You accepted Christ Jesus the Lord by trusting in him, so also live by trusting him.
\v 7 When we trust Jesus our lives become strong, like a tree is strong when its roots spread out and grow deep into the ground to provide a strong foundation for the tree to stand. When we obey Jesus' teachings our lives are like that strong tree, and we overflow with gratitude to God, and that gratitude becomes the strength of our lives that keeps us trusting in Jesus.
