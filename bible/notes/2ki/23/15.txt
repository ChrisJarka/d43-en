\v 15 Furthermore, he commanded them to tear down the place of worship at Bethel which had been built by King Jeroboam \add #1\add*, the king who persuaded the people of Israel to sin. They tore down the altar. Then they broke its stones into pieces and pounded them to become powder. They also burned the statue \add of the goddess\add* Asherah.
\v 16 Then Josiah looked around and saw some tombs there on the hill. He commanded his men to take the bones out of those tombs and burn them on the altar. By doing that, he desecrated the altar. That was what a prophet had predicted many years before when Jeroboam \add #1\add* was standing close to that altar at a festival.
\p Then Josiah looked up and saw the tomb of the prophet who had predicted that.

\v 15 Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had
made, even that altar and the high place he brake down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the
Asherah.
\v 16 And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount; and he sent, and took the bones out
of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Jehovah which the man of God
proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.
