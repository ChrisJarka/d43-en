====== Acts 21 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

It is important to recognize that 21:20-26 are one long quote. The reader can be confused by the back and forth nature of this section. Paul is not instructing James that Jewish Christians should obey the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]]. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "They are all determined to keep the law" ==
The Jews in Jerusalem wanted to still follow the law of Moses. Apparently this desire or practice, remained longer in Jerusalem. James was asking Paul for help in this matter.

== Nazarite vow ==
The vow made by the four men in this chapter was likely a Nazarite vow because they shave their heads ([[:en:bible:notes:act:21:22|21:23]].

== Gentiles in the temple ==
Gentiles were only allowed in the outer most part of the temple area. The Jews accused of bringing a Gentile man into an area where Gentiles were not allowed to go. This would have violated the [[:en:obe:kt:holy|holiness]] of God.

== "I am a citizen" ==
Men who had Roman citizenship were given many privileges. They could appeal to Caesar if they were accused of a crime. Having Roman citizen was very valuable and people would go to great lengths to attain citizenship.
