An idiom is a phrase that has a special meaning to the people of the language or culture that uses it. Its meaning is different from what a person might understand from the meanings of the individual words.

==== Description ====

An idiom is a phrase that has a special meaning to the people of the language or culture that uses it. Its meaning is different from what a person might understand from the meanings of the individual words.

> I am not worthy that you should __enter under my roof__. (Luke 7:6 ULB) 
The underlined idiom means "enter my house."

>he resolutely __set his face__ to go to Jerusalem. (Luke 9:51 ULB)

This idiom means "decided." 

> She was __very advanced in years__. (Luke 2:36 ULB)
This idiom means that she was very old.

> Let these words go deeply into your ears  (Luke 9:44 ULB)
This idiom means "Listen carefully and remember what I say."



>__He watched over me__, to take away my disgrace among people. (Luke 1:25 ULB)

The underlined sentence means "He had compassion on me" or "he regarded me kindly."


**Purpose**: An idiom is created in a culture probably somewhat by accident when someone describes something in an unusual way. But, when that unusual way communicates the message powerfully and people understand it clearly, other people start to use it.

=== Reasons this is a translation issue ===

  * People can easily misunderstand idioms in the original languages of the Bible if they do not know the cultures that originally wrote the Bible.
  * People can easily misunderstand idioms that are in the source language Bibles if they do not know the cultures that made those translations.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>For you are all __sons of__ the light and __sons of__ the day. We are not __sons of__ the night or the darkness.”  (1 Thessalonians 5:5 ULB)

The phrase “sons of” here is a Hebrew idiom used to refer to people who have a certain characteristic. Jews used this idiom even when speaking Greek. “Sons of light” refers to people who live and act in the “light,” that is, the truth.

>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God. If children, then also heirs, heirs of God __on the one hand__, and joint heirs __on the other hand__ with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.”  (Romans 8:16, 17 ULB)

The phrase “on the one hand … on the other hand” is an idiom that joins two different ways of thinking about something. When we think about being heirs, there are two special things to think about. One is that we our heirs of God and our inheritance is from him; the other is that we are joint heirs with Christ and will receive an inheritance just as Christ will. 

> When __day was breaking__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.” (John 21:4 ULB) 
The idiom “day was breaking” shows that it is very early in the morning and the sun was just coming up as the day was beginning. 

==== Translation Strategies ====
If the idiom would be clearly understood in your language, consider using it. If not, here are some other options.

  - Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.
  - Use a different idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.


==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.

  * **It is for these things that the wrath of God comes upon __the sons of__ disobedience.** (Colossians 3:6) 
      * "It is for these things that the wrath of God comes upon __people who are __ disobedient."
      * "It is for these things that the wrath of God comes upon __people who__ disobey him."

  * **If children, then also heirs, heirs of God __on the one hand__, and joint heirs __on the other hand__ with Christ**  (Romans 8:17 ULB)
    * “If children, then also heirs, __both__ heirs of God __and__ joint heirs with Christ”

  * **When __day was breaking__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.**  (John 21:4 ULB)\\
    * "When __the day was starting__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus."
    * "__Very early in the morning__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus."

2. Use an idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.

  * **When __day was breaking__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.**  (John 21:4 ULB)\\
    * "When __it was just starting to get light out__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus."
    * "__At first light__, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.
