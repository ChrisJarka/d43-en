\v 12 For the ministration of this service not only fills up the measure of the wants of the saints, but abounds also through many thanksgivings to God;
\v 13 seeing that through the proving of you by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;
\v 14 while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.
\v 15 Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.
