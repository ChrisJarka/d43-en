\v 11 Yahweh spoke to Moses,
\v 12 "When you take a census of the Israelites, then each will give a ransom for his life to Yahweh. This you will do when you count them so that there will be no plague among them, when you count them.
\v 13 Everyone who is counted in the census is to pay half a shekel, according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs). This half a shekel is for an offering to Yahweh.
\v 14 Everyone who is counted, from twenty years old and up, will give this offering to Yahweh.
