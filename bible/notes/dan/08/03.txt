\v 3 I looked up and saw before me a ram with two horns standing beside the canal. One horn was longer than the other but longer one grew more slowly than the shorter and was passed in length by it. 
\v 4 I saw the ram charging westward, then northward, and then southward; and none of the animals could stand before him. None of them was able to deliver anyone out of his hand. But he did whatever he wanted and he became great.
