\v 8 And now you are planning to fight against the kingdom that Yahweh established to be governed by David's descendants. It is true that you have a huge army, and you and your soldiers have brought with you the golden statues of calves that Jeroboam's workers made to be your gods.
\v 9 But you drove out the priests that Yahweh appointed, men who are descendants of Aaron the first high priest. You also drove out the descendants of Levi, and you appointed the priests that you wanted, like the people of other countries do. And so one may even come to set himself apart for the work of a priest, even sacrificing a young bull and seven rams as a sign of his ordination and his dedication to become a priest. But what kind of priest is he? He is consecrated to serve idols that are not gods at all!

\v 8 So now you plan to resist the kingdom of Yahweh that is held within the hand of the descendants of David, because you are a large army, and you have the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods.
\v 9 But did you not drive out the priests of Yahweh, the descendants of Aaron, and the Levites, and make priests of your own in the same way as the people of other lands do? Whoever comes to serve as a priest, sacrificing a young bullock and seven rams, he becomes a priest of what are not gods.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the kingdom of Yahweh** - This is a reference to a united Israel as it existed in the time of David and Solomon. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **that is held within the hand of the descendants of David** - Here the word "hand" represents authority and possession. Abijah is claiming that only the descendants of David have the rightful authority to rule Yahweh's kingdom. This can be stated in active form. AT: "that the descendants of David hold within their hand" or "which only the descendants of David have the authority to rule" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **the golden calves that Jeroboam made** - It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that Jeroboam had others make the golden calves. AT: "the golden calves that Jeroboam had his craftsmen make" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Have you not driven ... Levites?** - Abijah asks this rhetorical question to rebuke the people and to emphasize the positive answer that it anticipates. The question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You have driven ... Levites." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Have you not made ... lands?** - Abijah asks this rhetorical question to rebuke the people and to emphasize the positive answer that it anticipates. The question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You have made ... lands." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Whoever comes to set himself apart for service as a priest** - "Anyone who comes to set himself apart for service as a priest"
  * **a priest of what are not gods** - The phrase "what are not gods" refers to the golden calves that Jeroboam had his craftsmen make. Although the priests served them as if they were gods, they were not really gods. AT: "a priest of idols that are not really gods" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
