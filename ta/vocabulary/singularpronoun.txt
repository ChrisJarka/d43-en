====== English Singular Pronouns ======

Singular pronouns replace singular nouns, which are those that name one person, place, thing, or idea.

==== Singular Personal Pronouns: ====

Personal Pronouns refer to people.

  * //1st Person Singular Personal Pronoun//: **I**  or **me**  - refers to the //Speaker//
  * //2nd Person Singular Personal Pronoun//: **you**  - refers to the //Addressee//
In Standard English, **you**  is also used to refer to many different people. Therefore, the [[:en:ta:vocabulary:exclusive|exclusive]] or [[:en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive|inclusive]] of **you **  is based on context.

Many languages have one gender-neutral //3rd Person Singular Pronoun//, however, English has two, depending on the sex of the individual referenced.

  * //3rd Person Singular Personal Masculine Pronoun: //**he **- refers to a male person
  * //3rd Person Singular Personal Feminine Pronoun: //**she **- refers to a female person
English has a gender-neutral //3rd Person Singular Pronoun//, however, it can only refer to inanimate (non-living) objects.

  * //3rd Person Singular Inanimate Pronoun//: **it**  - refers to a singular thing
Therefore, if you want to remain gender-neutral in referencing a single person, you must use the phrase "he or she". Such as: "If __a student__  wants to get a good grade on the test, then __he or she__  must study hard."

Often times, however, "they" is used in place of a singular gender-neutral pronoun as opposed to the phrase "he or she". Such as: "If __a student__  wants to get a good grade on the test, then __they__  must study hard."
