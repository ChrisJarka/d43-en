\v 27 And the children of Israel asked of Jehovah (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
\v 28 and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to
battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver him
into your hand.
