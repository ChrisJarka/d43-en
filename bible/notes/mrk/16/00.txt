====== Mark 16 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Burial Practices ==
It was customary in ancient Israel to bury an important person in a tomb with a large rock to seal it.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter===

== A young man ==
The gospel accounts differ as to how many men or angels appeared in this interaction. It is probably that the men were angels, but their number is unclear. It is best to translate this as it appears in the ULB without trying to reconcile these passages. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:mat:28:01|Matthew 28:1-2]], [[:en:bible:notes:luk:24:04|Luke 24:4]], and [[:en:bible:notes:jhn:20:01|John 20:1-2]]).
