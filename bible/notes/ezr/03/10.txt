\v 10 And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets,
and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Jehovah, after the order of David king of Israel.
\v 11 And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks to Jehovah,
saying, For he is good, for his lovingkindness endures
for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Jehovah, because the foundation
of the house of Jehovah was laid.
