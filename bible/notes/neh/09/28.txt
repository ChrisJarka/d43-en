===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 28 But after there was a time of peace again, our ancestors again did things that displeased you. So again you allowed their enemies to conquer them. But whenever they cried out to you again \add to help them\add*, you heard them from heaven, and because you act mercifully, you rescued them many times.
\pi
\v 29 You warned them that they should again \add obey\add* your laws, but they became proud and stubborn, and they disobeyed your commands. They sinned by disobeying what you commanded them to do, the things that would enable them to live a good long life \add if they obeyed them\add*. They stubbornly refused [IDI] to listen to you and continued sinning.

\v 28 But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore left you them in the hand of their enemies, so
that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried to thee, you heard from heaven; and many times
did you deliver them according to your mercies,
\v 29 and testifiedst against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they dealt proudly, and listened not
to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances (which if a man do, he shall live in them), and withdrew the
shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
