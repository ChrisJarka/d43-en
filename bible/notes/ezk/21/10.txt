\v 10 it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? the
rod of my son, it contemns every tree.
\v 11 And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is furbished, to give it
into the hand of the slayer.
