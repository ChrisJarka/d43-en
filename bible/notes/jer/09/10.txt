\p
\v 10 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because
they are burned up, so that none passes through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the birds of the heavens
and the beasts are fled, they are gone.
\v 11 And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without
inhabitant.
\v 12 Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is
he to whom the mouth of Jehovah has spoken, that he may declare it? wherefore is the land perished and burned up like a
wilderness, so that none passes through?
