===== Digital Recording Devices =====

//This page answers the question:// //What options are there for digital recording devices?//

For modern digital recording, there are three general categories of devices used for audio recording.

==== Computers (Windows OS) ====

Desktop computers and laptops have been used for many years for recording and are the most popular and powerful devices. They are unequaled in their performance and capability to perform any recording, editing and file management task required during a project. Typically, these will have a larger screen and the ability to utilize keyboard and mouse commands, all of which aids in productivity and precision.

//Note about other operating systems for computers:// We have not focused on other OS platforms in this manual for the following reasons. Apple OS is also excellent for recording but the computers are typically far too expensive and unfamiliar for most end-users within the global Church. Linux OS is very cost effective but not familiar for most end-users. Initial testing has been done on laptops utilizing Chrome OS. While the hardware appears suitable for quality recording, it currently lacks good, fully functional, offline recording software adequate for voice recording. Therefore, Chrome is not considered a practical solution for recording at this time.


==== Tablets (Android OS) ====

Android is by far the predominate operating system for tablets today with numerous manufacturers and broad global distribution. These can typically be purchased at a much lower cost than a Windows OS laptop. Besides cost savings, one of their chief advantages is portability (at the compromise of screen size and the other factors that boost productivity and efficiency).

A fully-functional, free recording/editing software (WavePad Free) exists for Android OS, with many other apps available or being developed that offer varying degrees of functionality. While software is not a limiting factor for Android devices, it is important to be aware that most manufacturers are not building their devices with quality audio hardware inside. There are 2 primary hardware issues with Android devices that are not detectable without hands-on testing to discover what level of provision for quality audio the manufacture included in the device.

Many tablets are not equipped with a 3.5 mm TRRS jack, which means that it cannot record with an external microphone (built-in mics usually produce very poor quality). Even if it does have a TRRS jack, the majority of tested tablets were discovered to have poor quality analog to digital converters inside, which convert the captured sound to digital data. Typically there is a significant amount of static noise in the recorded sound due to the poor quality converters.


==== Handheld Portable Recorders ====

Small, battery-powered handheld digital recorders have become popular in recent years and a wide variety of models are offered by many manufacturers of electronic equipment. These devices often include a set of basic recording and playback controls, an LCD screen user-interface, the ability to listen to recorded material on the device and the ability to name files. Many of these have an extremely long battery life, record to an SD card or can connect directly to a laptop and function as a USB mic.

Portable recording devices offer some conveniences, but they usually come with various tradeoffs in their capability for other important aspects of a project. Generally, portable recording devices have limited flexibility for file naming and inevitably will require the use of another recording device to do the majority of the audio project work. The best use for a portable device would be a circumstance where it is not possible to have any other equipment where the recording will happen. While there are circumstances in voice recording where this could be the right choice, it is our suggestion that the vast majority of these devices are ill-suited for the task of voice-recording in sub-optimal conditions. For example, nearly every model is designed with omni-directional condenser mics (often 2 or more of them), which is probably the worst possible design for recording voice narration in sub-optimal settings.
