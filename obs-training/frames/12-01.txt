{{:en:obs:obs-12-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The **[[:en:obe:other:israel|Israelites]]** were very happy to leave **[[:en:obe:other:egypt|Egypt]]**. **They were no longer [[:en:obe:other:servant|slaves]]**, and they were **going** to the **[[:en:obe:kt:promised-land|Promised Land]]**! The **[[:en:obe:other:egypt|Egyptians]]** gave the Israelites whatever they asked for, even gold and silver and other valuable things. Some people from other nations **[[:en:obe:kt:believe|believed]]** in **[[:en:obe:kt:god|God]]** and went along with the Israelites as they left Egypt.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **They were no longer slaves** - This could be translated as, “They were not slaves anymore.” 
  * **going** – Some languages may use a more specific word like “traveling” since they would be going a long distance to the Promised Land. 
  * **Promised Land** - This is the land that God had promised that he would give to Abraham's descendants.
