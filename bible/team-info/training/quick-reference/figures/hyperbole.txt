 === Matthew 23:24 === 
You blind guides, you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!

=== Luke 14:26 === 

If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters--yes, and his own life also--he cannot be my disciple.

  * **(1) does not hate his own father** - (3) This is an exaggeration to show how important it is to love Jesus much more than anyone else. **(4)** If it would be misunderstood, it can be translated as "does not love me much more than he loves his father" **(5)** (See: Hyperbole).

=== Judges 20:16 ===

Among all these people there were seven hundred chosen left-handed men; each of them could sling stones at something no wider than a hair and not miss.

**(1) could sling stones at something no wider than a hair and not miss** - (3) This exaggeration is used to show how amazingly accurately these men could aim and throw a stone a something. **(5)** (See: Hyperbole)
