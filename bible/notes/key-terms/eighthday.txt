====== eighth day ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Old Testament, male Jewish babies were circumcised on the eighth day after birth according to Jewish tradition.

  * Circumcision was required by God and was a symbol of the covenant relationship of the members of Abraham's family to God, which included blood relatives and other members that believed in Abraham's God, but it is not clear when this command was given.
  * In the New Testament, some Christians with a Jewish background wanted to keep this Jewish Tradition, and that became a source of conflict with Paul even though he himself himself had been circumcised on the eighth day.
