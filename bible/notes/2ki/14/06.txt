\v 6 But he put not their children to death; instead, he acted according to what was written in the Law, in the book of Moses, as Yahweh had commanded, saying, “The fathers will not die for the children, neither will the children die for the fathers. Instead, every person will die for his own sin.”
\v 7 He killed from Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, to this day.
