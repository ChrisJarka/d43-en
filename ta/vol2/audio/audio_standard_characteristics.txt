===== Characteristics =====

//This page answers the question:// //What are the characteristics of unfoldingWord audio?//

The following are important characteristics of audio files.

==== Technical Characteristics ====

  * Normalize to -3dB
  * Noise floor below -45 dB.
  * 1 second of silence at the beginning of file.
  * 1 second of silence at the end of file.
  * Use no compression or soft compression only. No heavily applied compression, limiting, noise gate or noise reduction.


==== Listening Characteristics ====

  * Speed of narration should be moderate, comfortable and easy to follow.
  * Voice must be clear and sound natural.
  * No echo, reverb or delay (use adequate acoustical treatment during recording).
  * No distracting background noises (clicking of computer mouse, conversations in next room, etc).
  * Any editing effects processing applied in the breaks between phrases must be non-detectable and maintain the natural sound characteristics and flow of the whole audio file. unfoldingWord Audio Engineering encourages proper recording technique rather than heavy reliance on post-production effects, which are too often used in excess and without knowledge and wisdom about the impacts, potentially causing irreversible degradation to the audio quality.


==== Review & Checking Characteristics ====

A minimum of 1 native speaker of the language must be present during the recording, editing and final listening of the recording. This person is to provide:
  * support and encouragement to the narrator
  * accuracy checking in the areas of text reading, word pronunciation and reading style


==== Editing Characteristics ====

  * Complete all editing of files in collaboration with the checker.
  * Set the appropriate pausing or silencing between OBS slides or Bible chapters for natural reading flow.
    * The length of pause will vary depending on the language and speed of narration.
  * Cue Markers are placed in audio at all frame changes in OBS and at important section transitions in other types of content (such as verses of Scripture).
