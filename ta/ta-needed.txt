===== Editing Process on tA Pages =====
The following lists are the pages that need work.  This is the process: 
  - Suggested topics arrive from Translation Notes writers.
  - Page is built and tagged with status 'draft jody'.
  - Jody will work on her list and then change the status from 'jody' to 'kara'
  - Kara will proof the pages, making changes as required, then change the status from 'kara' to Erika'.
  - Erika will then proof the page and change the tag status and chart above status to 'review'. 
  - tA Manager will then do a final check on the page and change the status to 'publish'. Then will add the link to the Bible chunk.
