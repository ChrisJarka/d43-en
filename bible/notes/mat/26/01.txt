===== Translation Notes: =====

  * This section that starts with "It came about that when Jesus had finished all these words" marks a transition ending his teachings to his disciples.
  * **all these words **- "All these words" refers back to either Jesus' entire teachings or his final discourse to his disciples that began in Matthew 24:4.
  * **the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified**  - If necessary, this passive phrase can be translated in an active voice as in the UDB. (See: Active or Passive)
