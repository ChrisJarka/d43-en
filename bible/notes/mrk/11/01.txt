disciples,
\v 2 and says to them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as you enter into it, you shall
find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him.
\v 3 And if any one say to you, Why do you this? say you, The Lord has need of him; and straightway he will send him back
hither.
