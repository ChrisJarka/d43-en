===== Use Your Ears =====

//This page answers the question:// //How important is listening compared to watching the screen?//

When beginning in audio editing, there is a tendency to focus too much on the visual display of the waveform. Too easily, a recordist can start to edit based on what is seen without even considering how the audio actually sounds. That is a common mistake. When editing, remember that your ears are your most valuable and important assessment tool, not your eyes.
