\q
\v 7 Her leaders used to shine like snow and were white as milk. [I know everyone uses leaders here, but the Heb. is Nazirite, and there is no biblical/textual motive for changing this to "leaders". This one bothered me in the original translation task as well. I finally consigned myself to considering it along these lines: even those who should be the purest (the Nazirites) are now unclean. A sort of hyper-emphatic statement on Jeremiah's part.]
Some identify Nazir with the concept of "leader," as Joseph is called the Nazir of his brothers in Deut. 33:16, the UBS manual points out. Otherwise, we'll need "Nazarites" with an exegetical note to the effect that these were considered the purest of the pure.
\q Their bodies were more ruddy than rubies; their form like sapphire.
\q
\v 8 Now darkness blackens their appearance, and they are unrecognizable in the streets,
\q for their skin clings to their withered bones. They have become like sticks!
