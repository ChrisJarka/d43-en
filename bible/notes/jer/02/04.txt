\p
\v 4 Hear you the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:
\v 5 Thus says Jehovah, What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked
after vanity, and are become vain?
\v 6 Neither said they, Where is Jehovah that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness,
through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed
through, and where no man dwelt?
