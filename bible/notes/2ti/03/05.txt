<usfm>
\v 5 \add And, although they will\add* pretend that they worship God, they will not let \add God's Spirit\add* work powerfully \add in their lives\add*. Do not associate with such people \f + \ft Or: Do not let such people join \add your congregation\add* \f*,
\v 6 because some such \add people, even now\add*, subtly\f + \ft Or: deceivingly \f* persuade foolish women to let them come into their houses, and then they deceive those women \add so that they control what those women think. These women\add* have been burdened with sins \f + \ft Or:have sinned very much \f* and they have been led to do \f + \ft Or:they do \f* the many \add evil\add* things that they strongly desire to do.
\v 7 \add Even though\add* they are always \add wanting to\add* learn new things, they are never able to recognize what is true.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 They will seem to honor God, but they will refuse to accept the power that God truly wants to give them. Stay away from people like this.
\v 6 These men persuade foolish women to let them come into their houses. Then they deceive those women so that they control what they think. These are women who sin all the time, so they follow these evil men into doing all sorts of bad things that they enjoy doing.
\v 7 Even though these women are always wanting to learn new things, they are never able to learn what is actually true.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 They will have a shape of godliness, but they will deny its power. Turn away from these people.
\v 6 For some of them are men who enter into households and captivate foolish women. These are women who are heaped up with sins and are led away by various desires.
\v 7 These women are always learning, but they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **have a shape of godliness** - "appear religious" or "appear righteous" or "appear good"
  * **they will deny its power** - Possible meanings are 1) "they will refuse to accept the power that God truly wants to give them" (UDB) or 2) "their lives will show no evidence of the godliness they say they have."
  * **Turn away from** - "Avoid"
  * **households** - Possible meanings are 1) "families" or "the family living in the house" or 2) physical "houses" (UDB).
  * **captivate** - "influence"
  * **foolish women** - "women who are spiritually weak." This can be because they fail to work at becoming godly or because they are idle or because they "are overwhelmed with sins."
  * **who are heaped up with sins** - Paul speaks of the attraction of sin as if sin were heaped up on the backs of these women. Possible meanings are 1) "who are overcome by an abundance of sins" or 2) "who sin often." The idea is that they are unable to keep from sinning. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who...are led away by various desires** - Paul speaks of evil influences on women as if they physically lead them to another location. AT: "These women desire many other things so much that they stop obeying Christ" or "These women stop obeying Christ and instead go after the many other things they desire." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
