===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to give an indirect quote of Yahweh. It can be translated as a direct quote and with Yahweh speaking in the first person. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:08:11|8:11-13]])
  * **He will** - Alternate translation: "I will" (UDB)
  * **be a sanctuary** - Yahweh compares himself to a sanctuary. This emphasizes that people can rely on God to protect them. Alternate translation: "I will be like a sanctuary and I will protect you." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **but he will be a stone that makes one trip and a rock that makes one stumble** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing are used for emphasis. Yahweh compares himself to a stone that cause people to fall when they walk blindly into it. And here the words "trip" and "stumble" refer to a person failing in a spiritual way. Alternate translation: "but for those who do not trust me I will be like a stone that they will trip over." (See: [[en:ta:translate:parallelism]] and [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]]) 
  * **to both the houses of Israel** - This refers to the people in the Northern kingdom and the Southern kingdom. This can be translated "to the people in Judah and Israel." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **as a trap and as a snare** - This compares a bird caught in a trap to the faithless person who is caught in the trap of sin. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]]) and (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]])
  * **inhabitants of Jerusalem** - "people living in Jerusalem"
  * **Many will stumble over it and fall and be broken, and be ensnared and captured.** - Many faithless people will fall over or be broken by Yahweh, the rock.  Many will be trapped and caught because of their lack of faith.
