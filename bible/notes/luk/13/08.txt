===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **He answering says to him**- explanation: The servant, laborer, employer, steward or trustee responds to his master, or employer
    * **Lord**-: This is a noble title accorded a person of authority and power over another person or something. A true lord has the unchallenging rights and power to do anything to his possession, belonging, or property at will.
    * **Let it alone this year also**-: The servant (with definite length of time and course of action in mind) appealed to the master to extend his patience for one more year.
    * **I shall dig about it**-: The servant reveals or expresses his course or plan of action to his master
    * **And if it bears fruit after that, well **-: The servant (without being over optimistic) recognizes the new condition and preparation he gives to the tree, the fig tree may bear fruit which is the master's desire, then the tree will continue to live.
    * **But if not**-: That is if the fig tree fails to bear fruit in spite of all the servant's effort, the master has gotten his support to take the fig tree down. Both the patience of the master and the grace of the servant will henceforth be justly terminated.
