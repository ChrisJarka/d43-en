<usfm>
\v 14 But there will be a time when people \add who are solemnly promising to do something\add* will no longer say, '\add I will do this\add*, \add just as surely\add* as Yahweh lives - the one who brought the Israelite people here from Egypt.'
\v 15 Instead, they will say '\add I will do this\add*, \add just as surely\add* as Yahweh lives - the one who brought us Israelite people back to our own land, from the lands to the north and from all the other lands to which he had exiled\f + \ft Or: forced us to go \f*.' \add They will be able to say that\add* because \add some day\add* I will bring your descendants back to this land that I gave to your ancestors.

\v 14 Therefore, behold, the days are coming—this is Yahweh's declaration—when it will no longer be said, 'As Yahweh lives, the one who brought up the people of Israel from the land of Egypt.'
\v 15 but, 'As Yahweh lives, the one who brought up the people of Israel from the land of the north and from the lands where he had scattered them.' For I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their ancestors.
