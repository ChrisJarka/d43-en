<usfm>
\v 3 I have declared the  things from  long ago, I declared them, and I showed them: suddenly I did
them, and they came to pass.
\v 4 Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck muscles tight as iron , and your forehead like  bronze,
\v 5 therefore I  declared it to you beforehand; before it happened I informed you; so you should not  say, "My
idol has done them", or "my carved image, or my metal image has commanded these things."
