\v 1 The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the
truth;
\v 2 for the truthâ€™s sake which remains in us, and it shall be with us for ever:
\v 3 Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and
love.
\b
\p
\v 4 I rejoice greatly that I have found certain of your children walking in truth, even as we received commandment
from the Father.
\v 5 And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning,
that we love one another.
\v 6 And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the
beginning, that you should walk in it.
\v 7 For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, even they that confess not that Jesus Christ comes in the
flesh. This is the deceiver and the anti-christ.
\v 8 Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which we have wrought, but that you receive a full reward.
\v 9 Whosoever goes onward and remains not in the teaching of Christ, has not God: he that remains in the teaching, the same
has both the Father and the Son.
\v 10 If any one comes to you, and brings not this teaching, receive him not into
your house, and give him no greeting:
\v 11 for he that gives him greeting partaketh in his evil works.
\b
\p
\v 12 Having many things to write to you, I would not write them
with paper and ink: but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.
\v 13 The children of your elect sister salute thee.
