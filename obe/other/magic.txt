  * In Egypt, when God did miraculous things through Moses, the Egyptian pharaoh's magicians were able to do some of the same things, but their power did not come from God. They were not able to keep doing the miraculous things that Moses was doing.
  * Magic often involves casting spells or speaking incantations to make something supernatural happen.
  * In the Bible, the term "magic" may also refer to pagan practices of divination.
  * Pagan diviners would use different methods of trying to find out information from the spirit world, such as examining animal entrails or throwing animal bones on the ground, looking for patterns.
  * the diviners would interpret these patterns as signs or guidance from a false god that they worship.
  * God commands his people to not do any of these practices of magic or divination.
