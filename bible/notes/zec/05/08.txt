\v 8 The angel said, "This is Wickedness!" And he threw her back inside the basket and he threw the lead covver over its opening.
\v 9 I lifted my eyes and saw, two women were coming forth, and wind was in their wings--for they had wings like a stork's wings. They lifted up the basket between earth and heaven.
