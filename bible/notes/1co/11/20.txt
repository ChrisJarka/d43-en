\v 20 When you gather together, you  eat the meal that you say is to remember the death of the Lord Jesus for us.
\v 21 But what happens when you eat is that each person eats his own meal before he thinks about sharing his food with anyone else. As a result, when the meal is over, some people are still hungry and others are drunk! So it is not a meal that honors the Lord.
\v 22 You act as though you do not have your own houses in which you can eat and drink whatever you want to!? I certainly will not praise you!

\v 20 Therefore when you come together, it is not the right way to eat the Lordâ€™s supper.
\v 21 Because each one eats his own supper before the other. One is hungry, and another is drunk.
\v 22 What? Do you not have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise the church of God, and put to shame those that do not have enough? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you?  I do not praise you for this.
