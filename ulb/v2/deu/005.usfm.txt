\c 5
\p
\v 1 And Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in
your ears this day, that you may learn them, and observe to do them.
\v 2 Jehovah our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
\v 3 Jehovah made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
\v 4 Jehovah spoke with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire
\v 5 (I stood between Jehovah and you at that time, to show you the word of Jehovah: for you were afraid because of the fire,
and went not up into the mount), saying,
\p
\v 6 I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
\p
\v 7 You shall have no other gods before me.
\p
\v 8 You shall not make to you a graven image, nor any likeness
of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
\v 9 you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them; for I, Jehovah, your God, am a jealous God, visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me;
\v 10 and showing lovingkindness to thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
\p
\v 11 You shall not take the name of Jehovah your God in vain: for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in
vain.
\p
\v 12 Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Jehovah your God commanded thee.
\v 13 Six days shall you labor, and do all your work;
\v 14 but the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah your God: in it
you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your man-servant, nor your maid-servant, nor your ox,
nor your ass, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates; that your man-servant and your female servant may
rest as well as thou.
\v 15 And you shall remember that you was a servant in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah your God brought you out thence by a
mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore Jehovah your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day.
\p
\v 16 Honor your father and your mother, as Jehovah your God commanded thee; that your days may be long, and that it may go well
with thee, in the land which Jehovah your God gives thee.
\p
\v 17 You shall not kill.
\p
\v 18 Neither shall you commit adultery.
\p
\v 19 Neither shall you steal.
\p
\v 20 Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbor.
\p
\v 21 Neither shall you covet your neighbor’s wife; neither shall you desire your neighbor’s house, his field, or his
man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or anything that is your neighbor’s.
\p
\v 22 These words Jehovah spoke to all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the
thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them to me.
\v 23 And it came to pass, when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire,
that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
\v 24 and you said, Behold, Jehovah our God has showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the
midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God does speak with man, and he liveth.
\v 25 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of Jehovah our God any more,
then we shall die.
\v 26 For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we
have, and lived?
\v 27 Go you near, and hear all that Jehovah our God shall say: and speak you to us all that Jehovah our God shall speak
to thee; and we will hear it, and do it.
\p
\v 28 And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me; and Jehovah said to me, I have heard the voice of the
words of this people, which they have spoken to thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.
\v 29 Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be
well with them, and with their children for ever!
\v 30 Go say to them, Return you to your tents.
\v 31 But as for you, stand you here by me, and I will speak to you all the commandment, and the statutes, and the
ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
\v 32 You shall observe to do therefore as Jehovah your God has commanded you: you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to
the left.
\v 33 You shall walk in all the way which Jehovah your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with
you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.
