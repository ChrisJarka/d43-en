===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **These are the generations of**  - This is a special use of the word "generations." It can be translated as "This is the account of" or "This is the story about" or "These are what heaven and earth begot" (with the focus on man). The noun "generations" is related to the verb meaning "to give birth" or "to produce offspring." What follows is detail about the sixth day of creation. It happened before God rested on the seventh day.
  * **in the day that Yahweh God created**  - The word "day" seems to refer to the time span of the creation (all six days) and not just to the sixth day. One could translate this phrase as "when the Lord God made."
  * **bush of the fieldâ€¦plant of the field**  - The "bush" generally describes a shrub growing in the wild, from which animals eat. The "plant" indicates foliage like vegetables or greens from which both animals and humans can eat.
