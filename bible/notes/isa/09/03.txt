**TRANSLATION NOTES:**

  * **You**- refers to Yahweh
  * **they rejoice like the joy at harvest time, as men rejoice when they divide the plunder -**  This is a doublet stating the same thing in two different ways. This is also a simile where the joy of the people is compared to the joy at harvest or when diving the the things captured at battle. (See: doublet and simile)
