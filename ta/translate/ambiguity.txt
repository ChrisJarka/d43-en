====== Ambiguity ======

Ambiguity happens when a single word or phrase can have more than one meaning.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

When translating, use source texts and any supplemental texts needed to make sure you understand the correct intended meaning.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

===== Examples from English =====

Ambiguity caused by a single word with two different meanings:

Jane works near the bank.  Bank in English can mean the land next to a river or a place where money is kept.

Ambiguity caused by unclear sentence structure:

Tom saw the man with the binoculars.  In this sentence, it is unclear who has the binoculars: Tom or the man.  This sentence could mean that Tom used the binoculars so see the man or that Tom saw a man who was carrying binoculars.
