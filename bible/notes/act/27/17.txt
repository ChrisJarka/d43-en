\v 17-18 After the sailors \add hoisted\f + \ft Or: lifted \f*\add* the lifeboat onto the ship, they tied ropes around the ship's hull to strengthen the ship. The sailors were afraid that, \add because the wind was pushing the ship\add*, it might run onto the sandbanks off the coast of Libya to the south \add and get stuck there. So\add* they lowered the largest sail \add so that the ship would move slower. Even so\add*, the wind continued to move the ship along. \add The wind and the waves\add* continued to toss the ship about roughly, so on the next day the sailors began to throw overboard the things that the ship was carrying.

\v 17-18 After the sailors hoisted the lifeboat onto the ship, they used cables to reinforce the ship. They passed them under the ship's hull to strengthen the ship. The sailors were afraid that we would run aground on the sandbars called  Syrtis, so they lowered the sea anchor and in this manner the wind drove us along. The wind and the waves continued to toss the ship about roughly, so on the next day the sailors began to throw things overboard.

\v 17 When they had hoisted it up, they used its ropes to bind the hull of the ship. They were afraid that we should run upon the sandbars of Syrtis, so they let down the sea anchor and were driven along.
\v 18 We were very battered by the storm, so the next day the sailors began to throw the cargo overboard.

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **they had hoisted it up** - "they had lifted up the lifeboat" or "they had pulled the lifeboat aboard the ship"
  * **they used its ropes to bind the hull of the ship** - The "hull" is the body of the ship. They tied ropes around it so that the ship would not come apart during the storm.
  * **sandbars of Syrtis** - Sandbars are very shallow areas in the sea where ships can get stuck in the sand. "Syrtis" is located on the coast of Libya, northern Africa. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **they let down the sea anchor** - They put the ship's anchor in the water in order to slow down where the wind would blow them.
  * **were driven along** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "had to go in whatever direction the wind blew us" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **We were very battered by the storm** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "The wind roughly blew us back and forth" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
