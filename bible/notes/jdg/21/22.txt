\v 22 If their fathers or brothers come to us and complain \add about what you have done\add*, we will say to them, 'Act kindly toward the men of the tribe of Benjamin. When we fought them, we did not \add leave any women alive to become their\add* wives, and you did not give those young women to the men from the tribe of Benjamin. \add They stole them\add*. So you will not be guilty, \add even though you said that you would not allow any of your daughters to marry one of them\add*.'~"

\v 22 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to complain to us, that we will say to them, Grant them
graciously to us, because we took not for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them,
else would you now be guilty.
