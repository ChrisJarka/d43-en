===== translationNotes: =====

  * **with his weapon in his hand** - This means they were ready to fight. See how you translated a similar phrase in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:23:06|23:7]].
  * **put the crown on him** - This is a symbolic act to show that they are making him king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **gave him the covenant decrees** - The symbolic act of giving him a scroll with the decrees shows that they expect him to obey them. It is unclear if these decrees were a portion of the law of Moses, or a separate set of rules for kings to obey. AT: "presented to him the covenant decrees that he should obey" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **anointed him** - This was a symbolic act to show that he was chosen by God to be the king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_symaction]])
  * **Long live the king** - "May the king live a long life"
