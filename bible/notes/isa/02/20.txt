\q1
\v 20 On that day people will  throw away their idols of silver and of gold
\q1 that they have made for themselves to worshipâ€”they will throw them away to the moles and bats.
\q1
\v 21 to go into the caves of the rocks and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, 
\q1 from before the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.
\q1
\v 22 Stop  trusting in man, whose life-breath is in his nostrils; 
\q1 for why what does he amount to?
