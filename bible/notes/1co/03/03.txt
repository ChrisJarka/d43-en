\v 3 because you are still controlled by your self-directed nature. Some of you are jealous and quarreling. That shows that your self-directed nature is controlling you!\f + \ft Or: Does not that prove your self-directed nature is controlling you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* It shows that \add you are acting like\add* unbelievers act.
\v 4 By some of you saying, "I am \add loyal to\add* Paul," and others saying, "I am \add loyal to\add* Apollos," you show that \add you are acting like\add* unbelievers.\f + \ft Or: does not it show that \add you are acting like\add* unbelievers? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*


\p
\v 5 \add So what you really ought to think about\add* Apollos and me \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* is that we(dl) are merely men who serve God. As a result of our \add telling you the message about Christ\add*, you trusted in him. Both of us\add (dl)\add* are merely doing the work that the Lord appointed us to do.

\v 3 Even though you are Christians, you are doing what your sinful natures want you to do. How do I know? There is jealousy and arguing between you and many others, and all of you belong to Christ! You have not grown spiritually enough to overcome your sinful habits. You are so immature in your faith that you are committing the worst sorts of sins and living the same way as people who do not know God.
\v 4 Your desire for divisions is tearing the church apart. Some of you declare your loyalty to Paul, some to Apollos. Your divisions are the kinds of things that sinful people, who are ruled by their desires for power and party favorites, would do. 

\p
\v 5 Compared to the great work that God has done in your lives, why is Apollos important? or what does Paul matter? We are both servants, and we serve the same God. We both teach the same message, and we do the work the Lord gave us to do. There is no division between Apollos and Paul!

\v 3 For you still living by the flesh. For there is jealousy and strife among you. Does your flesh control you, and do you live your lives as sinful people? 
\v 4 For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another says, "I follow Apollos," are you not doing what sinful people do?
\v 5 What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, and the Lord gave each of them to you.
