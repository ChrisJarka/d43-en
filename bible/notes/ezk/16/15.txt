===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But you trusted in your own beauty **: Yahweh is telling the woman that she thinks her beauty is because of what she has done rather than in what Yahweh has done for and to her.
  * **acted like a whore **- Alternate translation: "behaving like a woman who sells herself to strangers" or "acting promiscuous" (UDB).
  * **you poured out your acts of prostitution on everyone who passed by**. - The word "poured" is not refering to a liquid. It is possibly referring to the woman having sex with any man who came to her.
  * **You became the property of those men! **- This verse is not telling the reader that the woman was sold to other men. It seems to be telling the reader that having sex with the men may make her obedient to them or that she has entered into a covenant or committment similar to marriage with them.
  * **made for yourself high places decked with various colors **- Alternate translation: "built beautiful places for worshipping idols" or "make beautifully decorated shrines" (UDB).
