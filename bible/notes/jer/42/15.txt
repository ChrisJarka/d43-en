\v 15 Then now listen to this word of Yahweh, remnant of Judah, â€˜Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, says this: If you actually set your face to go to Egypt, and go to sojourn there,
\v 16 then it will be the sword that you fear will overtake you there in the land of Egypt and the famine that you are concerned about will pursue Egypt there after you. Then you will die there.
\v 17 So it will be that all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to sojourn there will die by sword, famine, or plague, and there will be no survivor from them or one who escapes from the calamity that I will bring upon them!
