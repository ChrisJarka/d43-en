\v 5 Then Sarai said to Abram, "This wrong on me is because of you. I gave my handmaid into your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. Let Yahweh judge between me and you."
\v 6 But Abram said to Sarai, "See here, your maid is in your power, do to her what you think best." So Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.

  * **in your power**  - "under your authority"
  * **do to her what you think best** - The phrase “what you think best” tells some more information about what Sarai should do to Hagar.
