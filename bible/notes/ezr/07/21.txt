\v 21 For from me, Artaxerxes the king, I am setting a judgment for all the treasurers that are beyond the River, that anything that Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of 
Heaven, asks for you, it will be given completely,
\v 22 up to one-hundred talents of silver, one-hundred talents of grain, one-hundred baths of wine, and one-hundred baths of oil, also salt that is not prescribed.
\v 23 Anything that comes from the judgment of the God of Heaven do with devotion for the house of the God of Heaven, for why should his wrath be upon the kingdom of this king 
and his sons?
