===== translationNotes: =====

  * **The sin offering must be killed** - Yahweh gave the priests specific instructions for where the sin offering must be killed. This can be translated in active form. AT: "You must kill the sin offering" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
  * **where the burnt offering is killed** - "where they kill the animal for the burnt offering"
  * **before Yahweh** - "to Yahweh"
  * **It must be eaten** - Only the priests were to eat the offerings. Translate this so it is clear that only the priests were allowed to eat what was offered and burned. AT: "He must eat it" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
