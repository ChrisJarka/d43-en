\c 1
\p
\v 1 The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
\p
\v 2 Jehovah is a jealous God and avengeth; Jehovah avengeth and is full of wrath; Jehovah takes vengeance on his adversaries,
and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.
\v 3 Jehovah is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means clear
the guilty: Jehovah has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
\v 4 He rebuketh the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel; and the flower of
Lebanon languisheth.
\v 5 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt; and the earth is upheaved at his presence, yea, the world, and all that
dwell therein.
\v 6 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his wrath is poured out like fire,
and the rocks are broken asunder by him.
\v 7 Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knows them that take refuge in him.
\v 8 But with an over-running flood he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.
\p
\v 9 What do you devise against Jehovah? he will make a full end; affliction shall not rise up the second time.
\v 10 For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly as dry stubble.
\v 11 There is one gone forth out of thee, that devises evil against Jehovah, that counsels wickedness.
\v 12 Thus says Jehovah: Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass
away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.
\v 13 And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst your bonds in sunder.
\p
\v 14 And Jehovah has given commandment concerning thee, that no more of your name be sown: out of the house of your gods will I
cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make your grave; for you are vile.
\p
\v 15 Behold, upon the mountains the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publisheth peace! Keep your feasts, O Judah,
perform your vows; for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.
