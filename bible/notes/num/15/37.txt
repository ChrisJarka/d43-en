\v 38 "Speak to the descendants of Israel and command them to make for themselves fringes on the borders of their garments throughout their generations, to make the fringe of each border a cord of blue.
\v 39 It will be to you a fringe, that you may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of Yahweh and do them so that you do not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to play the harlot
