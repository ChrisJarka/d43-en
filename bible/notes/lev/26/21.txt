===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **walk against me **- AT: "rebel against me and do those things which I have commanded you not to do" (see: Idiom)
  * **I will bring seven times more blows on you, in proportion to your sins**  - Yahweh will punish his sinful people according to their sin - the more they sin, they more they will be punished.  "Seven times" - see how this was translated in __26:18__.
