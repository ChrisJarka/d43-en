\c 17
\p
\v 1 And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 Speak to the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers’ house, of all their princes according to
their fathers’ houses, twelve rods: write you every man’s name upon his rod.
\v 3 And you shall write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers’ houses.
\v 4 And you shall lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
\v 5 And it shall come to pass, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the
murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.
\v 6 And Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their
fathers’ houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
\v 7 And Moses laid up the rods before Jehovah in the tent of the testimony.
\p
\v 8 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the
house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bare ripe almonds.
\v 9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every
man his rod.
\v 10 And Jehovah said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children
of rebellion; that you may make an end of their murmurings against me, that they die not.
\v 11 Thus did Moses: as Jehovah commanded him, so did he.
\p
\v 12 And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.
\v 13 Every one that comes near, that comes near to the tabernacle of Jehovah, dieth: shall we perish all of us?
