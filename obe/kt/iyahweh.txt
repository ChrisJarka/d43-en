====== I, Yahweh; me, Yahweh ======

===== Definition: =====

Many times in the Old Testament, when God is speaking about himself, he uses his name instead of a pronoun.

  * For example, instead of saying, "Honor me," he says, "Honor Yahweh." 
  * To make it clear that God is the one talking about himself, the ULB often translates this by adding a pronoun such as in, "Honor me, Yahweh" or "I, Yahweh say."
  * By adding the pronoun "I" or "me," the ULB indicates to the reader that God is the speaker.


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Some translators may decide it is natural and clear in their language to simply follow the literal text and use "Yahweh" with no pronoun added.
  * Some may decide to use a pronoun with Yahweh only a few times at the beginning or occasionally in a particular portion of text, but then omit the pronoun in the rest of that section. An ULB example of this is Deuteronomy 5:9-16.
  * It is best if possible to keep the name Yahweh where it literally occurs in the text, but some translations may decide to use the pronoun alone in some places, to make the text more natural and clear.
  * This is a summary of possible ways to translate a phrase like, "Yahweh your God":         
    * "I [Me], Yahweh your God"
    * "I" [Me], your God"
    * "Yahweh your God" (literal)
    * Use the pronoun plus Yahweh at the beginning of the text or occasionally, but not throughout.
    * Introduce the quote with something like, "This is what God says" 
  * Whatever way it is translated, the reader should be able to understand that Yahweh is talking about himself, and it should sound natural in the language.
