\c 139
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 O Jehovah, you have searched me, and known me.
\q
\v 2 You know my downsitting and mine uprising;
\q You understand my thought afar off.
\q
\v 3 You search out my path and my lying down,
\q And are acquainted with all my ways.
\q
\v 4 For there is not a word in my tongue,
\q But, lo, O Jehovah, you know it altogether.
\q
\v 5 You have beset me behind and before,
\q And laid your hand upon me.
\q
\v 6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
\q It is high, I cannot attain to it.
\q
\v 7 Whither shall I go from your Spirit?
\q Or whither shall I flee from your presence?
\q
\v 8 If I ascend up into heaven, you are there:
\q If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there.
\q
\v 9 If I take the wings of the morning,
\q And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
\q
\v 10 Even there shall your hand lead me,
\q And your right hand shall hold me.
\q
\v 11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me,
\q And the light about me shall be night;
\q
\v 12 Even the darkness hides not from thee,
\q But the night shineth as the day:
\q The darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
\q
\v 13 For you did form my inward parts:
\q You did cover me in my motherâ€™s womb.
\q
\v 14 I will give thanks to thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
\q Wonderful are your works;
\q And that my soul knows right well.
\q
\v 15 My frame was not hidden from thee,
\q When I was made in secret,
\q And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
\q
\v 16 Your eyes did see mine unformed substance;
\q And in your book they were all written,
\q Even the days that were ordained for me,
\q When as yet there was none of them.
\q
\v 17 How precious also are your thoughts to me, O God!
\q How great is the sum of them!
\q
\v 18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
\q When I awake, I am still with thee.
\q
\v 19 Surely you will kill the wicked, O God:
\q Depart from me therefore, you bloodthirsty men.
\q
\v 20 For they speak against you wickedly,
\q And your enemies take your name in vain.
\q
\v 21 Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that hate thee?
\q And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
\q
\v 22 I hate them with perfect hatred:
\q They are become mine enemies.
\q
\v 23 Search me, O God, and know my heart:
\q Try me, and know my thoughts;
\q
\v 24 And see if there be any wicked way in me,
\q And lead me in the way everlasting.
