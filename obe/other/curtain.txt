====== curtain ====== ===== Definition: ===== In the Bible, curtains were thick, heavy pieces of material used to make the tabernacle and the walls surrounding its courtyard. * These curtains were made of animal skins or cloth and were used to form the top and sides of the tabernacle building. * There was also a curtain that separated the holy place from the most holy place in the tabernacle. and then later in the temple building. * It was this curtain in the temple that was miraculously torn from top to bottom when Jesus died. * In some English Bible versions, this curtain of the inner sanctuary is also called a veil, which has the meaning of concealing or hiding from view..
