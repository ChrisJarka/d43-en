\v 14 When a fire \add starts burning a house\add*, it becomes clear whether the builders used \add materials in their\add* work \add that will burn, or materials that will not burn\add*. Similarly \f + \ft metaphor \f*, when God judges us, it will be clear whether we taught others things that were long-lasting and valuable or not. If \add the materials that are used to\add* build a house \add are materials that\add* do not burn, the builder will receive a reward \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if we have taught others things that are valuable and long-lasting, God will give us a reward\add*.
\v 15 If \add the things that we have taught\add* are not valuable and long-lasting \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add we will not get a reward\add*. We will be saved \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will save us \f* \add from hell\add*, but \add that is all that we will get. We will be like a man who\add* escapes from a fire \add without saving any of his possessions\add*.
