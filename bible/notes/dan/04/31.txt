\v 32 Your advisors will force you to live away from other people. You will live in the fields with wild animals, and you will eat grass like cows do. You will live that way for seven years, until you learn that it is I, the Supreme God, who rules over the kingdoms of this world, and I appoint the ones whom I have chosen to rule them."

\v 31 While the word was in the kingâ€™s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven,
saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from you:
\v 32 and you shall be driven from men; and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; you shall be made to eat
grass as oxen; and seven times shall pass over thee; until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and
gives it to whoever he will.
