**What is Joshua about?**\\

Joshua means “Yahweh saves.” This name is common in the Bible, and it is the name of Jesus in the New Testament. Joshua lead the conquest into Canaan, and the time of the conquest, and the date of the book of Joshua would be about 1,400 BC (again some scholars have a date about 200 years later (1,200 BC), but the internal evidence seems to points toward the earlier date).
The previous section of the Old Testament, Genesis through Deuteronomy come together as the Pentateuch (“Five Volumes as a Book”). Beginning with Joshua, the next section is called “The Former (or “Earlier”) Prophets.” In the book of Joshua the promise of entering the Promised Land is fulfilled—that promise made by Yahweh in Genesis (see Genesis 12:2-3; 15:18-21), that God would give his people the Promised Land, the where the people of Israel would live. The deliverance from Egypt would not be complete until Israel inhabited the land that Yahweh gave them. So while Joshua is not part of the Pentateuch (and is not written by Moses, but Joshua), it is a continuation of that story, and picks up from the end of Deuteronomy and the account of the death of Moses (See Joshua 1:1). The date of Joshua would be within the life of Joshua, or about

The organization of Joshua. Chapters 1-12 are a narrative about the early military battles. These battles were carried out as acts of covenantal loyalty, to obey the commands of Yahweh and to act only with his approval and according to his Law. It is the mighty acts of God and him delivering their enemies into their hands, over and over, that is the center of this account. Even in their failures, Israel defined the ideal of what covenantal obedience should be.
Joshua lays out the rules by which holy war should be waged (cf. 7:1-6, and 20:1-20 for example). Some people were spared annihilation, but in many cases, the army was ordered to not only kill the people and their livestock, but also they were to completely destroy (“give over to destruction”) everything in the city. Other times the city would be plundered and the animals would be taken, but the people would be killed.
There is a unity in Israel when the nation sets out to meet their enemies. This is seen in the phrase, “all Israel” went out, which occurs in many of the battles recorded in the book of Joshua. All the people would gather for instruction. All the people would take up the responsibility of punishing some who disobeyed the Law of God. All the people were sent out in battle, in a unity of all the tribes working together. And all the tribes received their portion of the Promised Land when it was allocated at the end of the conquest of Canaan. Chapter 22 records the building of a stone tower with 12 stones representing the unity and solidarity of Israel at this time.

**Text-Question**\\

The time-marker “this day” occurs throughout Joshua, and suggests that Joshua wrote these accounts during the time or just after the events (see 4:9; 5:9; 6:25; 7:26; 8:28-29; 9:27; 10:27; 13:13; 15:63; and 16:10). The time of the exodus to be about 1446 BC, and conquest of Canaan seems to be about 1446 BC, the conquest appears to be about 1400 BC. (Some argue about the dates, but these appear to hold the greatest weight of evidence and consistency with the Biblical record. There remain many confusing claims from the archaeologists and some scholars have very different interpretations about times and places in Joshua. Some reject the biblical accounts or retell them in another time. But the accounts should stand as they are recorded in the biblical text, with hope that more clarity will be discovered in the future.) There are some important miracles recorded in Joshua, and they should be studied with care and taken seriously as part of the Biblical record.
