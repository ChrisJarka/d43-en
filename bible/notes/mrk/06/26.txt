\v 26 And the king was exceeding sorry; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat, he would not reject her.
\v 27 And straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded him
in the prison,
\v 28 and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother.
\v 29 And when his disciples heard thereof, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
