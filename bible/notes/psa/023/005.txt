Now the psalm tells how God welcomes and protects like someone who welcomes a guest into his home.

  * **prepare a table** - 
  * **anointed my head with oil** - The shepherd would put oil on their cuts for soothing and healing.
  * **my cups runs over** - These words are used to indicate the joy of the author. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
