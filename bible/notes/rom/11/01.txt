<usfm> \c 11 \p \v 1 I say then, did God reject his people? May it never be. For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. \v 2 God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scriptures say about Elijah, how he pleaded with God against Israel? \v 3 "Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life." </usfm>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I say then...I also am**  - The pronoun "I" in 11:1 refers to Paul.
  * **did God reject his people?**  - Paul asks this question so that he can answer the questions of other Jews who are upset that the Gentiles have been included in God's people, while the hearts of the Jewish people have been hardened. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:rhetorical-question|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **tribe of Benjamin**  - In the scriptures, God divided the people of Israel into twelve tribes. Each tribe was descended from a son or grandson of Jacob. This refers to the tribe descended from Benjamin.
  * **whom he foreknew**  - "whom he knew ahead of time"
  * **Do you not know what the scriptures say about Elijah, how he pleaded with God against Israel? **  - This may be a rhetorical question.  The people of Rome were both Jewish and Gentile, but Paul seems to be speaking to the Jewish believers who would know who Elijah was and what he had said in the scriptures.  (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:rhetorical-question|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **what the scriptures say**  - Paul writes "the scriptures say," but the scriptures are not speaking, he is referring to what is written in the scriptures. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:personification]])
  * **he pleaded with God**  - "he begged God"
  * **Lord, they have killed**  - The pronoun "they" refers to the people of Israel.
  * **I alone am left**  - The pronoun "I" in 11:3 refers to Elijah.
