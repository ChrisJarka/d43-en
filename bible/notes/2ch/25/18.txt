\v 18 But Jehoash replied this to King Amaziah: "One time a thistle growing \add in the mountains\add* in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar tree, saying 'Give your daughter to my son in order that he can marry her.' But a wild animal in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle under his feet.
\v 19 \add The meaning of what I am say is that\add* you are saying to yourself that your army has defeated the army of Edom, so you have become very proud \f + \ft doublet \f*. But you should stay at your home. It would not be good \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* for you to cause trouble, which would result in you and your kingdom of Judah being destroyed."

\v 18 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod
down the thistle.
\v 19 You sayest, Lo, you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast: abide now at home; why should you
meddle to your hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with thee?
