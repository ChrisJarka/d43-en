\c 26

\v 1 Then Job answered and said,
\q
\v 2 How have you helped him that is wiyout power!
\q How have you saved the arm that has no strength!
\q
\v 3 How have you counselled him that has no wisdom,
\q And plentifully declared sound knowledge!
\q
\v 4 To whom have you uttered words?
\q And whose spirit came forth from thee?
\b
\q
\v 5 They that are deceased tremble
\q Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.
\q
\v 6 Sheol is naked before God,
\q And Abaddon has no covering.
\q
\v 7 He stretches out the north over empty space,
\q And hangs the earth upon nothing.
\q
\v 8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds;
\q And the cloud is not tore under them.
\q
\v 9 He incloseth the face of his throne,
\q And spreadeth his cloud upon it.
\q
\v 10 He has described a boundary upon the face of the waters,
\q To the confines of light and darkness.
\q
\v 11 The pillars of heaven tremble
\q And are astonished at his rebuke.
\q
\v 12 He stirreth up the sea with his power,
\q And by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.
\q
\v 13 By his Spirit the heavens are garnished;
\q His hand has pierced the swift serpent.
\q
\v 14 Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways:
\q And how small a whisper do we hear of him!
\q But the thunder of his power who can understand?
