\v 23 So Yahweh God drove out the man and his wife from the park of Eden. Yahweh God had created Adam from the ground, and he forced him to plow that same ground, from where he had come.
\v 24 After Yahweh God drove them out, on the east side of the park he placed cherubim and an angel holding a flaming sword that flashed back and forth, in order to block the entrance, so that people could not go back to the tree that enables anyone who eats its fruit to live forever.

\v 22 Yahweh God said, "Now the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. So now he must not be allowed to put forth his hand. If he does, he will take from the tree of life also, eat it, and live forever."
\v 23 Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he was taken.
\v 24 So God drove the man out of the garden, and he placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, with a flaming sword that turned every way, on order to guard the way to the tree of life.
