\v 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children that were crying in the
temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were moved with indignation,
\v 16 and said to him, Hearest you what these are saying? And Jesus says to them, Yea: did you never read, Out of the
mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise?
\v 17 And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
