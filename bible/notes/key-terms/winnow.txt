====== winnow, sift ======

===== Definition: =====

To winnow means to separate grain from the unwanted chaff by tossing both the grain and chaff into the air, allowing the wind to blow the chaff away. The word "sift" refers to shaking the winnowed grain in a sieve to separate any remaining unwanted materials, such as dirt or stones, from the grain.

  * In the Bible, the process of winnowing grain is used figuratively to describe God bringing hardship to separate the righteous people from the unrighteous people.
  * The word "sift" is used in a similar figurative way of separating the righteous people from the unrighteous. For example God said, "I will sift the house of Israelâ€¦as grain is sifted in a sieve".
  * One time, Jesus used the term "sift" when he told Simon Peter, "...Satan has asked permission to sift all of you like wheat, but I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail" (Luke 22:31-32). This "sifting" probably referred to hardship that would challenge the disciples' faith. It is implied that this would reveal those who would abandon their faith in the face of suffering, separating them from those who would persevere in believing.
