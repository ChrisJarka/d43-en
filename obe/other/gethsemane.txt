====== Gethsemane ======

===== Facts: =====

Gethsemane was a garden of olive trees east of Jerusalem beyond the Kidron valley and near the Mount of Olives.

  * The garden of Gethsemane was a place where Jesus and his followers would go to be alone and rest, away from the crowds.
  * This is where Jesus prayed in great grief before Judas came there with those who arrested him and condemned him to death.
