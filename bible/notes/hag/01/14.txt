  * **Yahweh stirred up the spirit of the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and the spirit of the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people** - Stirring the spirit is a metonym for making someone want to act. AT: "Yahweh made the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and all the remnant of the people want to act" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])

  * **in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month** - This is just 23 days after he received the vision. This is the sixth month of the Hebrew calendar.
