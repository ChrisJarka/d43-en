\v 10 Thus says the Lord Jehovah: It shall come to pass in that day, that things shall come into your mind, and you shall devise an evil device:
\v 11 and you shall say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates;
\v 12 to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn your hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and against the people that are gathered out of the nations, that have gotten cattle and goods, that
dwell in the middle of the earth.
