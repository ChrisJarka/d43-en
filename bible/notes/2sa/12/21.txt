\v 21 Then said his servants to him, What thing is this that you have done? you did fast and weep for the child, while it
was alive; but when the child was dead, you did rise and eat bread.
\v 22 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knows whether Jehovah will not be
gracious to me, that the child may live?
\v 23 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
