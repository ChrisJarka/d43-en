\v 1 Several years later, God tested Abraham \add to find out\add* whether Abraham \add really trusted in him and would obey him\add*. He called out to Abraham, and Abraham replied, "I'm here."
\v 2 God said, "Your son, Isaac, whom you love very much, is the only son \add who is still here with you\add*. But take him and go together to the Moriah region. Offer him as a sacrifice like a burnt offering, on a hill that I will show you."
\v 3 So Abraham got up early the next morning, put a saddle on his donkey, and took with him two of his servants along with his son, Isaac. He also chopped some wood to kindle a fire for a burnt offering. Then they started traveling to the place God told him about.

\v 1 It came about after these things that God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!" Abraham said, "Here I am."
\v 2 Then God said, "Take  your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go  to the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains there, which I will tell you about."
\v 3 So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, along with Isaac his son. He cut the wood for the burnt offering, then set out on his journey to the place that God had told him about.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It came aboutâ€¦that** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
  * **after these things** - The phrase "these things" refers to the events in the chapter 21.
  * **Here I am** - Abraham said this to show that he heard the angel of Yahweh and that he was ready to listen. Your language may have a way of showing this, such as "Yes?" or "What is it?" or "I'm listening."
  * **Take your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac** - This could be translated as "Even though you love him, take Isaac, your only son." The phrase "your only son" emphasizes that this was the one God was talking about; he did not consider Ishmael, the son born by the slave woman.
  * **saddled his donkey**  - This could also be translated as "loaded his donkey."
