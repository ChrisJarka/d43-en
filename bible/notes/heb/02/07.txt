\v 7 You made him a little lower than the angels;
\q You crownedst him with glory and honor,
\q And did set him over the works of your hands:
\q
\v 8 You did put all things in subjection under his feet.
\p For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him.
