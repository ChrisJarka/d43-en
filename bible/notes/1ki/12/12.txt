\v 12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
\v 13 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
\v 14 and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your
yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
