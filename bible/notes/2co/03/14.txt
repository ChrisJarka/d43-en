\v 14 But their minds were hardened. Even until this very day when the old covenant is read, the same covering  exists, because only in Christ is the covering removed.
\v 15 But even today, whenever Moses is read, a covering lies over their hearts.
\v 16 But whenever a person turns to the Lord, that covering is removed.
