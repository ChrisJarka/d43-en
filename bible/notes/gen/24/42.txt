\v 42 When I came today to the well, I prayed, 'Yahweh God whom my master, Abraham worships, if you are willing, please allow this journey of mine to be successful.
\v 43 Listen to me. I am standing alongside a well. A girl may come to draw water. I am asking you that if I say to her, "Please, give me a little water to drink from your jar."
\v 44 If she says to me, "Certainly, drink some, and I will also draw some water for your camels," that will be the woman whom you have chosen for my master's son!'

\v 42 And I came today to the spring, and said, "O Lord,  God of my master Abraham, if now you are prospering my way which I go,
\v 43 see me standing by the spring of water;  may  the young woman that comes out to draw water, to whom I shall say,' Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink;"
\v 44 and she shall say to me, "Drink  and I will also draw for your camels:" "May she be the woman whom the Lord
has chosen for my masterâ€™s son."
