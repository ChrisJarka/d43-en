\c 45
\d For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves.
\q
\v 1 My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter;
\q I speak the things which I have made touching the king:
\q My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
\q
\v 2 You are fairer than the children of men;
\q Grace is poured into your lips:
\q Therefore God has blessed you for ever.
\q
\v 3 Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one,
\q Your glory and your majesty.
\q
\v 4 And in your majesty ride on prosperously,
\q Because of truth and meekness and righteousness:
\q And your right hand shall teach you terrible things.
\q
\v 5 Your arrows are sharp;
\q The peoples fall under thee;
\q They are in the heart of the king’s enemies.
\q
\v 6 Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
\q A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of your kingdom.
\q
\v 7 You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness:
\q Therefore God, your God, has anointed you
\q With the oil of gladness above your fellows.
\q
\v 8 All your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and
cassia;
\q Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.
\q
\v 9 Kings’ daughters are among your honorable women:
\q At your right hand does stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
\q
\v 10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear;
\q Forget also your own people, and your father’s house:
\q
\v 11 So will the king desire your beauty;
\q For he is your lord; and reverence you him.
\q
\v 12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift;
\q The rich among the people shall entreat your favor.
\q
\v 13 The king’s daughter within the palace is all glorious:
\q Her clothing is inwrought with gold.
\q
\v 14 She shall be led to the king in broidered work:
\q The virgins her companions that follow her
\q Shall be brought to thee.
\q
\v 15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led:
\q They shall enter into the king’s palace.
\q
\v 16 Instead of your fathers shall be your children,
\q Whom you shall make princes in all the earth.
\q
\v 17 I will make your name to be remembered in all generations:
\q Therefore shall the peoples give you thanks for ever and ever.
