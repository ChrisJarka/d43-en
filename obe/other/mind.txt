====== mind ======

===== Definition: =====

The invisible, conscious thinking faculty of our soul.

  * Man's brain is the physical organ of thinking, his mind is the consummate total of his thoughts and reasoning.
  * Christians are said to have the mind of Christ, we are to think about what He thought about, and develop Biblical reasoning as He had. For the Christian this is accomplished only through the enabling of God's Holy Spirit.
