\v 26 Then God said, "Now we will make human beings that will have many of the qualities that we have. I want them to rule over the fish in the sea, over the birds, over all the livestock\f + \ft Or: domestic animals \f*, and over all the other creatures that move across the surface of the ground."
\v 27 So God created human beings that were like him in many ways. He made them to be like himself. He created some to be male and some to be female.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Let us make**  - The word "us" here refers to God. God was saying what he intended to do. He may have used this plural form "us" as kings sometimes used to do, or because he was talking to himself. Some translate it as "I will make." (See: [[:en:ta:vocabulary:pluralpronouns|English Plural Pronouns]])
  * **man**  - "human beings" or "people." This word does not mean males only.
  * **in our image, after our likeness**  - These two phrases mean the same thing. They are used together in order to emphasize what they say. This can also be translated as "to be like us" as in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:doublet|Doublet]]) This verse does not tell in what ways God made people to be like himself. Since God does not have a body, it probably does not refer to physical likeness.
  * **have dominion over**  - "rule over" or "have authority over"
  * **God created man â€¦ he created man**  - These two sentences are a doublet used to emphasize that God created people in his own image.
