\v 1 Yahweh showed me something. Behold, two baskets of figs were placed before Yahweh's temple. (This vision happened after Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, took into exile Jeconiah, son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, 
the officials of Judah, the craftsmen and the metalworkers from Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon.
\v 2 One basket of figs was very good, like 
first ripe figs, but the other basket of figs was so very bad that they could not be eaten.
