\c 5
\d For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Give ear to my words, O Jehovah,
\q Consider my meditation.
\q
\v 2 Listen to the voice of my cry, my King, and my God;
\q For to you do I pray.
\q
\v 3 O Jehovah, in the morning shall you hear my voice;
\q In the morning will I order my prayer to thee, and will keep watch.
\q
\v 4 For you are not a God that has pleasure in wickedness:
\q Evil shall not sojourn with thee.
\q
\v 5 The arrogant shall not stand in your sight:
\q You hate all workers of iniquity.
\q
\v 6 You will destroy them that speak lies:
\q Jehovah abhorrs the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.
\q
\v 7 But as for me, in the abundance of your lovingkindness will I come into your house:
\q In your fear will I worship toward your holy temple.
\q
\v 8 Lead me, O Jehovah, in your righteousness because of mine enemies;
\q Make your way straight before my face.
\q
\v 9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth;
\q Their inward part is very wickedness;
\q Their throat is an open sepulchre;
\q They flatter with their tongue.
\q
\v 10 Hold them guilty, O God;
\q Let them fall by their own counsels;
\q Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions;
\q For they have rebelled against thee.
\q
\v 11 But let all those that take refuge in you rejoice,
\q Let them ever shout for joy, because you defendest them:
\q Let them also that love your name be joyful in thee.
\q
\v 12 For you will bless the righteous;
\q O Jehovah, you will compass him with favor as with a shield.
