\v 32 Those who do not know God are always worrying about things like that. But God, your Father who is in heaven, knows that you need all those things, \add so you should not worry about them\add*.
\v 33 Instead, the most important thing you should be concerned about is to let \add God\add* completely direct your life, and to strive \add to live\add* righteously. \add If you do that\add*, all the things that you \add need\add* will be given to you \f + \ft Or:God will give you all the things \add that you need\add* \f*.
\v 34 So \add each day\add* do not be worried about what will happen to you the next day, because \add when\add* that day \f + \ft personification \f* comes, \add you\add* will be concerned about \add what happens during\add* that day. You will have enough to be concerned about each day. \add So do not worry ahead of time\add*."

\v 32 For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.
\v 33 But seek you first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.
\v 34 Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient to the day is the evil
thereof.
