\v 6 David \add went back to where his men were and\add* talked to Ahimelech, who was from the Heth people-group, and Joab's brother Abishai, whose mother was \add David's older sister\add* Zeruiah. He asked them, "Who will go with me down into the camp where Saul is?"
\p Abishai replied, "I will go with you."
\v 7 So that night David and Abishai crept into Saul's camp. They saw that Saul was asleep. His spear was stuck in the ground near his head. Saul was asleep in the middle of the camp. Abner and the other soldiers were sleeping around Saul.

\v 8 Abishai whispered to David, "Today Yahweh has enabled us to kill your enemy! Allow me to fasten Saul to the ground \add by thrusting\add* my spear into him. It will be necessary for me to strike him only once. I will not \add need to\add* strike him twice."

\v 6 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who
will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
\v 7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his
spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him.
\v 8 Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered up your enemy into your hand this day: now therefore let me strike him, I
pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time.
