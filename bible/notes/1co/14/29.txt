<usfm>
\v 29 If there are prophets who have an exposition of the word of God to share, let two or three of them speak to the church, and those who listen should evaluate the message to ensure it follows the teaching of the word.
\v 30 But if one seated in the worshiping assembly is given an insight into the passage that would benefit all who are there, let the one teaching stop speaking, so all in the church can listen to the insight and application into the message of the prophet.
