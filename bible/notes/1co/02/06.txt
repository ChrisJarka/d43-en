===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I do teach a message that people who are  \add spiritually\add* mature  \add consider to\add* be wise. But I do not teach a message that unbelievers  \add consider to be\add* wise. I also do not teach a message that unbelieving rulers in the world consider to be wise. \add What they think about it does not matter\add*, because  \add some day\add* they will lose their power\f + \ft Or: not be ruling anymore \f*.
\v 7 Instead, I teach about what God planned wisely  \add long ago\add*. It is something that people did not know about previously because  \add God\add* did not reveal it previously. But God determined before he created the world that he would greatly benefit us by his wise plan.

\v 6 Of course, what I and my co-workers proclaim is a kind of wisdom, but it is for people who are ready to listen to God. It is very different from what unbelievers or those who rule in this world—who are quickly passing away—call wisdom.
\v 7 We proclaim a kind of wisdom that God had kept hidden until now. God made this wisdom before there was time or creation, so that he would one day bring honor to us.

\v 6 Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this world, or of the rulers of this age, who are passing away.
\v 7 But we speak God’s wisdom in hidden truth—the hidden wisdom that God foreordained before the ages for our glory.
