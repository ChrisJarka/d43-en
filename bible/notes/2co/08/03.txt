Without anyone telling them \add to share their possessions\add*,
\v 4 they themselves kept requesting us to let them participate in what \add other believers\add* are doing in \add sending a gift of money to\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* God's people \add in Judea province\add*.

\v 3 For according to their ability, I testify, even beyond their means, they gave willingly,
\v 4 begging us with much urging for the favor of sharing in this ministry to the saints:
\v 5 and this, not as we had expected, but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.
