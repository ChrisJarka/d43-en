<usfm> \v 21 So stop admiring what unbelievers want, and stop being proud of doing those things. For God has given you all things. How does that compare to anything unbelievers can give you? \v 22 God gave you Paul, and he gave you Apollos, and Peter. And God gave you this world, and your life, and his victory over death. And God gives you all that is and all that will be in the future—they are all yours; \v 23 and you are Christ's; and Christ is God's. </usfm>
