\v 17 So then, even though I \add changed my mind later and did not do what\add* I \add first\add* planned to do, \add it was not because I did not have an important reason for changing my plans\add*. Surely you do not\add really think\add* that I decide on what I am going to do like people who do not know God do!\f + \ft Or: Do you \add really think\add* that I decide on what I am going to do like people who do not know God do? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I am \add not like that\add*. I am not \add a person who\add* says \add to people\add*, "Yes, \add certainly I will do that\add*," and then \add for no good reason changes his mind and says\add*, "No, \add I will not do it\add*."
\v 18 Just as surely as God always does what he says \add he will do, it is true that I have never said\add*, "Yes, \add I will do this\add*" when I \add really meant\add* "No."

\v 17 So then, even though I changed my mind later and did not do what I first planned to do, it was not because I did not have an important reason for changing my plans. Surely you do not really think that I decide on what I am going to do like people who do not know God do! I am not like that. I am not a person who says to people, "Yes, certainly I will do that," and then for no good reason changes his mind and says, "No, I will not do it."
\v 18 Just as surely as God always does what he says he will do, it is true that I have never said, "Yes, I will do this" when I really meant "No."

\v 17 When I was thinking this way, did I vacillate? Or do I plan things according to human standards, so that that I say "Yes, yes" and "No, no" at the same time?
\v 18 But just as God is faithful, we do not say both "Yes" and "No."
