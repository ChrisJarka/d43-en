\v 10 They deceive my people, saying "Things will go well for us" when things will not go well. It as like they want to make people think that there is a very strong wall when it is not strong.
\v 11 So, tell those prophets who cover the wall with whitewash that the wall will surely fall down. It will rain very hard. I will send big hailstones to fall. Very strong winds will blow against it.
\v 12 When the wall falls down, the people will certainly say to those prophets, "The white paint certainly did not  make the wall strong!"

\v 10 Because of thi,s and because they led my people astray and said, "Peace!' when there is no peace, they are building a wall that they will paint with whitewash.
\v 11 Say to those who are whitewashing the wall: 'It will fall down; there will be a downpour of rain, and I will send hailstones to make it fall 
down, and a windstorm wind to break it down.'
\v 12 See, the wall will fall down. Have others not said to you, 'Where is the whitewash that you put on it?'
