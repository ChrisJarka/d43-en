\v 31 And as you want people to do to you, you should do the same to them.
\v 32 And if you only love people who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
\v 33 And if you do good only to people who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
\v 34 And if you only lend things to people who you expect will give them back to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, and expect to receive the same amount back again.
