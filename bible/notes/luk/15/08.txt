\v 9 And when she finds it, she will call together her friends and neighbors and say to them, "Be very happy with me, because I have found the coin that I lost!'
\v 10 I tell you that, in a similar way, there is much joy among the angels of God because of one sinner who repents from his sins ."

\v 8 Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she were to lose one coin, would not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she has found it?
\v 9 And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.'
\v 10 Even so, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."
