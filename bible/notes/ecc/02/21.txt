<usfm>
\v 21 Some people work wisely and skillfully, using the things that they have learned. But \add when they die\add*, they leave everything, and someone who has not worked hard acquires those things. And that also seemed to be senseless and caused me to be discouraged.
\v 22 So, it seems that people do not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* get much for all the hard work that they do and for worrying.
\v 23 Every day the work that they do causes them to experience pain and to be worried. And during the night their minds are not able to rest. That also is very frustrating.

\v 21 For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that has not
labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
\v 22 For what has a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?
\v 23 For all his days are but sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart takes no rest.
This also is vanity.
