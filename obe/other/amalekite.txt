====== Amalekite ======

===== Facts: =====

Amalekites were a nomadic people group, originating, perhaps with Amalek, the grandson of Esau.

  * They ranged across South Canaan from the Negeb to Arabia.
  * The Amalekites were bitter enemies with Israel from the beginning of Israel's occupation of Canaan.
  * Both Saul and David led military expeditions against the Amalekites, the latter having two of his wifes taken captive by them.
  * By the 8th century BC, the Amalekites were no longer a threat to Israel.
