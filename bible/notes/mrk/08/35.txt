\v 35 You must do that, because those who try to save their lives by denying that they belong to me will lose their lives. Those who are killed because they are my disciples and because they tell others the good news will live forever with me.
\v 36 People might get everything they want in this world, but they are really gaining nothing if they do not gain eternal life!
\v 37 Think carefully about the fact that there is absolutely nothing that people can give to God that would enable them to gain eternal life!
