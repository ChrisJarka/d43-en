\v 11 But when Christ came as our high priest, \add he brought\add* the good things that are now available. When he appeared, \add he went into God's presence in heaven. That is like a\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* very great and perfect tent not made by humans \f + \ft Or:which no human made \f* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*; that is, it is not part of the world \add God\add* created. It was better \add than the tent Moses set up here on earth\add*.
\v 12 \add When a high priest goes into the inner room in the tent each year, he takes\add* goats' blood and calves' blood \add to offer as a sacrifice\add*. But Christ did not \add do that. It was as though\add* he went into that very holy place only once, taking his own blood with him. By doing that, he eternally redeemed us.

\v 11 But when Christ came as our high priest he brought the good things that are now available. When he appeared, he went into God's presence in heaven, which is like the Sacred Tent, but it is not part of the world God created. It was better than the tent Moses set up here on earth because it was perfect.
\v 12 When a high priest goes into the inner room in the tent each year, he takes goats' blood and calves' blood to offer as a sacrifice. But Christ did not do that. It was as though he went into that very holy place only once because he gave his own blood on the cross, once. By doing that, he eternally redeemed us, because his blood flowed from himself, the completely holy Son of God.

\v 11 But Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, through the greater and more perfect Sacred Tent that is not made by human hands, one not of this created world.
\v 12 Not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, Christ entered into the very holy place one time for everyone and secured our redemption forever.
