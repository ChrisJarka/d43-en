====== Metonymy ======

===== Description =====

This module answers the question: What is a metonymy?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_intro|Figures of Speech]] \\ 

Definition\\
Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. A //**metonym**// is a word or phrase used as a substitute for something it is associated with.

Examples\\ 
**and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.** (1 John 1:7) \\
The blood substitutes for the atoning death \\  
**The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ?** (1 Corinthians 10:16) \\ 
The cup is for what is in the cup.
 
Purpose \\
Metonymy can be used:
  * as a shorter way of referring to something
  * to make an abstract idea more meaningful by referring to it with the name of a concrete object associated with it.
  * to keep certain people from knowing what is being referred to
=== Reason this could be a translation issue ===
There are many metonymies in the Bible. If they are not recognized for what they substitute for, they will be badly misunderstood.


===== Examples from the Bible =====
**The Lord God will give him __the throne__  of his father, David.**  Luke 1:32 \\ 
A throne represents the authority of a king. Throne is a metonym for "kingly authority," "kingship" or, "reign". This means that God would make him become the king that was to follow King David.\\ 
\\ 
**and he will reign over __the house of Jacob__  forever.**  Luke 1:33a \\ 
The word "house" is often used in the Bible as a metonym for "household", the people living in the house. This, too, can be a metonym for descendants. So "the house of Jacob" in this verse refers to "Jacob's descendants".\\ 
\\ 
**who warned you to flee from __the wrath__  to come?**  Luke 3:7b \\ 
The word "wrath" or "anger" is a metonym for "punishment." God was extremely angry with the people, and as a result, he would punish them,

===== Translation Strategies =====

  - If a metonym is easily recognized what it refers to, use the metonym.
  - If the metonym is simply an idiom, or if it would be unclear to the readers, use the name of the thing the metonym refers to. (See Idiom)



===== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied =====

1. If a metonym is easily recognized what it refers to, use the metonym.

2. If the metonym is simply an idiom, or if it would be unclear to the readers, use the name of the thing the metonym refers to. (See Idiom) 

**The Lord God will give him __the throne__  of his father, David.**  (Luke 1:32) \\ 
The Lord God will make him become the king/chief like his ancestor, King David.\\ 
\\ 
**and he will reign over __the house of Jacob__  forever.**  (Luke 1:33a) \\ 
and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever. \\ 
\\ 
**who warned you to flee from __the wrath__  to come?**  (Luke 3:7b) \\ 
who warned you to flee from God's coming punishment?

===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * If a metonym is used in poetry or a sermon or some other kind of formal speech, and if the readers would be able to recognize what it refers to, use the metonym.
  * If the metonym is simply an idiom, or if it would be unclear to the readers, use the name of the thing the metonym refers to. (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
