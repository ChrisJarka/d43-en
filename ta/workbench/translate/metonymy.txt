===== Translation Suggestions =====
  * If a metonym is used in poetry or a sermon or some other kind of formal speech, and if the readers would be able to recognize what it refers to, use the metonym.
  * If the metonym is simply an idiom, or if it would be unclear to the readers, use the name of the thing the metonym refers to. (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
===== Examples from the Bible =====
**The Lord God will give him __the throne__  of his father, David.**  Luke 1:32 \\ 
A throne represents the authority of a king. Throne is a metonym for "kingly authority," "kingship" or, "reign". This means that God would make him become the king that was to follow King David.\\ 
\\ 
**and he will reign over __the house of Jacob__  forever.**  Luke 1:33a \\ 
The word "house" is often used in the Bible as a metonym for "household", the people living in the house. This, too, can be a metonym for descendants. So "the house of Jacob" in this verse refers to "Jacob's descendants".\\ 
\\ 
**who warned you to flee from __the wrath__  to come?**  Luke 3:7b \\ 
The word "wrath" or "anger" is a metonym for "punishment." God was extremely angry with the people, and as a result, he would punish them.
===== Examples from English =====
**"The __pen__  is mightier than __the sword__"**  means "Writing one's ideas and reasons is more effective than fighting."\\ 
\\ 
**"Could you give me __a hand__  with this work?"**  means "Could __you help__  me with this work?"
