<usfm> \v 1 Because of that, \add if anyone should ask\add*, "Has God rejected his people \add the Jews?" I would declare that\add* he certainly has not \add rejected all of us! You can realize that by remembering that\add* I also belong to the \add people of\add* Israel. I am a descendant of Abraham, and I belong to the tribe of Benjamin, \add but God has not rejected me!\add* \v 2 No, God has not rejected his people, whom he chose long ago \add to be people whom he would bless in a special way\add*. Remember \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what is written \f + \ft personification \f* in the Scriptures about Elijah when he \add mistakenly\add* complained to God about \add the people of\add* Israel, saying: \v 3 "Lord, they have killed \add the rest of\add* your\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* prophets, they have destroyed your altars. I am the only one \add who believes in you\add* who remains \add alive\add*, and now they are trying to kill me!" </usfm>

<usfm> \c 11 \p \v 1 I say then, did God reject his people? May it never be. For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. \v 2 God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scriptures say about Elijah, how he pleaded with God against Israel? \v 3 "Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life." </usfm>
