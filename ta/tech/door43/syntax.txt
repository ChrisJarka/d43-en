====== Formatting Content ======

**DokuWiki** supports some simple markup language, which tries to make the files to be as readable as possible. This page contains the possible syntax you may use when editing the pages. The syntax for the described formatting is in the box below the examples. If you want to try something, just use the [[:playground:playground|playground]] page.

===== Basic Text Formatting =====

**Headings** - every page has a heading. The title of the page determines the displayed name in page lists and directories. The number of equal signs determine the formatting. It is important for the formatting of specific headers to be the same in all pages.

<code>
====== Page Header ====== is 6 equal signs, space, title, space, 6 equal signs

===== Section Header ===== is 5 equal signs, space, title, space, 5 equal signs

DokuWiki supports **bold**, //italic//, __underlined__ and ''monospaced'' texts. Of course you can **__//''combine'' //__**all these.

**Paragraphs**  are created from blank lines. If you want to **force a newline**  without a paragraph, you can use two backslashes followed by a whitespace or the end of line.

This is some text with some linebreaks \\ Note that the two backslashes are only recognized at the end of a line \\or followed by \\ a whitespace \\ this happens without it.

You should use forced newlines only if really needed.
