\v 34 For in very deed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, who has withholden me from hurting thee, except you had
hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child.
\v 35 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said to her, Go up in peace to your house; see, I
have listened to your voice, and have accepted your person.
