  * Abimelech took Sarah into his household, but returned her immediately when God appeared to him in a dream and rebuked him.
  * Abraham and Abimelech made an agreement regarding disputed ownership of wells at Beersheba.
  * Many years later, Abraham's son Isaac and his family settled in the region ruled by Abimelech.
