\p
\v 1 But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation,
and mocked the Jews.
\v 2 And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they fortify
themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish,
seeing they are burned?
\v 3 Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox go up, he shall break down
their stone wall.
