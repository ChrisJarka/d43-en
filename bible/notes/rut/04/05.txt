\v 5 Then Boaz told him, "When you buy the land from Naomi, you will also be taking Ruth, \add the woman\add* who is from Moab, \add to be your wife\add*, in order that she may \add give birth to a son who\add* will inherit the property of her dead husband \f + \ft metonymy \f*."

\v 5 Then Boaz told him, "When you buy the land from Naomi, you will also need to marry Ruth, our relative's widow from Moab, in order that she may have a son to inherit the property and carry on the name of her dead husband."
\v 6 Then the nearer relative said, "If that is so, I do not want to buy the property, because then my own children would not inherit the property. I give you the right to buy the property instead of me!"

\v 5 Then Boaz said, "The day that you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also take Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, in order to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance."
\v 6 And the near kinsman said, "I cannot redeem it for myself without damaging my own inheritance. You take my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem it."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **from the hand of Naomi** -  Possible meanings are 1) "from the hand of Naomi," or 2) "from the hand of Naomi and from Ruth the Moabitess." 
  * **wife of the dead** - Ruth was the widow of one of Elimelech's sons, not of Elimelech himself; Naomi was Elimelech's true widow. But since Naomi was past childbearing years and neither of Elimelech's sons had fathered children, Ruth was considered Elimelech's widow in this context.
  * **raise up the name of the dead**  - Any sons Ruth bore would be considered Elimelech's sons (see verse 17). See Gen 48:5, where Jacob adopts Joseph's two oldest sons to replace the two evil sons Jacob effectively disowned.
  * **damaging my own inheritance**  - The kinsman was willing to buy the land, which would have allowed him to plant more crops or graze more animals. Marrying Ruth would have meant extra responsibility, and any son she bore would mean further expense as he was growing up; that son would be considered Elimelech's son when the kinsman died and could possibly inherit some of what the kinsman wanted to pass on to his own sons.
  * **take my right of redemption**  - Or "I will not redeem it; redeem it yourself" or "redeem it instead of me."
