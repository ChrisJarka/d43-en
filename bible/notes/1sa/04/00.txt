The Philistine Army invaded Israel and the Israeli army went to fight them, but was defeated. The Israelis decided that if they took the Ark into the next battle, God would cause them to win. So Eli's sons took the Ark into the next battle. The Philistines won the battle, killed Eli's two sons and captured the Ark. When Eli heard that the Ark was captured he fell over, broke his neck and died. Hearing this news his daughter-in-law named her new baby "The Glory has Departed."
