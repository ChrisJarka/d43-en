====== Judges 02 General Notes ======



=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Yahweh tests Israel ==

Yahweh said "Because this nation has broken the terms of my covenant that I had set in place for their fathers—because they have not listened to my voice— I will not, from now on, drive out from before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died. I will do this so that I may test Israel, whether or not they will keep the way of Yahweh and walk in it, as their fathers kept it." That is why Yahweh left those nations and did not drive them out quickly.
