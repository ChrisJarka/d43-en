\v 23 Because of that, not one of them will see the land that I promised their ancestors \add that I would give to them\add*. No one who rejected me will see that land.
\v 24 But Caleb, who serves me \add well\add*, is different from the others. He obeys me completely. So I will bring him into that land that he has already seen, and his descendants will inherit\f + \ft Or: possess \f* some of it.
\v 25 So, since the descendants of Amalek and Canaan who are living in the valleys \add in Canaan are very strong\add*, when you leave here tomorrow, \add instead of traveling toward Canaan\add*, go back along the road through the desert towards the Red Sea."

\v 23 surely they shall not see the land which I sware to their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised me see it:
\v 24 but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.
\v 25 Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
