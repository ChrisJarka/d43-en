\v 1 Yahweh, whenever I tell you that I am unhappy \add about what is happening to me\add*,
\q2 you always act justly\f + \ft Or: fairly \f*.
\q1 So now allow me to ask about one more thing \add that I do not understand\add*:
\q2 why are wicked people \add often\add* very prosperous?
\q2 Why do things go very well for dishonest\f + \ft Or: unfaithful \f* people?
\q1
\v 2 You allow them to prosper
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* trees that grow tall and bear a lot of fruit.
\q1 They always say \f + \ft metonymy \f* good things about you,
\q2 but in their inner beings, they are really far from you.

\q
\v 1 You are righteous, Yahweh, whenever I bring disputes to you.
\q I must certainly tell you of my reason to complain: Why do the ways of the wicked succeed? All the faithless people are successful.
\q
\v 2 You planted them and they took root. They continue to produce fruit.
\q You are near to them in their mouths, but far away from their hearts.
