\v 7 He set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the temple of God which God said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this temple, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever.  
\v 8 I will not remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by Moses.”
\v 9 Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to do that which is evil even more than the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel.
