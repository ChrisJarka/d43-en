\c 32
\d A Psalm of David. Maschil.
\q
\v 1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven,
\q Whose sin is covered.
\q
\v 2 Blessed is the man to whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity,
\q And in whose spirit there is no guile.
\q
\v 3 When I kept silence, my bones wasted away
\q Through my groaning all the day long.
\q
\v 4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me:
\q My moisture was changed as with the drought of summer.
\qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 I acknowledged my sin to thee,
\q And mine iniquity did I not hide:
\q I said, I will confess my transgressions to Jehovah;
\q And you forgave the iniquity of my sin. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 For this let every one that is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found:
\q Surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach to him.
\q
\v 7 You are my hiding-place; you will preserve me from trouble;
\q You will compass me about with songs of deliverance. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go:
\q I will counsel you with mine eye upon you.
\q
\v 9 Be you not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding;
\q Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in,
\q Else they will not come near to thee.
\q
\v 10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked;
\q But he that trusts in Jehovah, lovingkindness shall compass him about.
\q
\v 11 Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, you righteous;
\q And shout for joy, all you that are upright in heart.
