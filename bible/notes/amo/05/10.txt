\v 10 He is the one who will punish you
\q1 because you hate those who challenge anyone who tries to make unjust decisions;
\q2 you hate those who tell the truth in your courts.
\q1
\v 11 You oppress poor people and force them to pay big taxes.

<usfm>
\q
\v 10 They hate anyone who corrects them in the city gate,
\q and they abhor anyone who speaks the truth.
\q
\v 11 Because you trample down the poor
\q and take portions of wheat from himâ€”
\q although you have built houses of worked stone,
\q you will not live in them.
\q You have delightful vineyards,
\q but you will not drink their wine.

  * **take portions of wheat from him** - "make him give you part of his grain"
  * **worked stone** - "cut stones" or "stones that people have cut"
  * **you will not drink their wine** - The word "their" refers to the vineyards. This may imply that no one will make the wine, or even that there will not be enough good grapes to make wine.
