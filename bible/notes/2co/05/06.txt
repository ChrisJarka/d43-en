\v 6 We know and are confident that as long as we live in our bodies here on earth, we do not yet live with the Lord in heaven
\v 7 (for we live our lives by trusting him, not by the things we can see here on the earth).
\v 8 Because we have put our trust in him, we would much prefer to leave these physical bodies in which we now live and to be with the Lord in his home in heaven.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Therefore always be confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord
\v 7 (for we walk by faith, not by sight).
\v 8 So we have confidence and we would rather be away from the body and to be at home with the Lord.
