\v 25 At that time Jesus answered and said, "I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you concealed these things
from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants;
\v 26 yes, Father, for thus it was well pleasing in your sight.
\v 27 All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone know
the Father except the Son and to whomever the Son wishes to reveal him.
