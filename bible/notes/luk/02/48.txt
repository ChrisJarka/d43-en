===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **When they saw him**  - That is, "When Mary and Joseph found Jesus."
    * **astonished**  - That is, "amazed" or, "shockingly surprised."
    * **Why have you treated us this way?**  - That is, "How could you do this?" This was somewhat of an indirect rebuke because she had been searching for him. Mary was not expecting an answer.
    * **Why were you searching for me?**  - That is, "Why did you two keep looking for me in other places?"
    * **Did you not know…?**  - This question expects a "yes" answer, even though both Mary and Joseph did not really know or expect that Jesus would be at the temple. It is as if Jesus was saying, "Both of you know that I must be here, right?"
    * **Must be**-Jesus says I continually need to be about my Father's business
    * **at my Father's house**  - Jesus was referring to the temple, and when he said "my Father" he was referring to God. But the next verse says that they did not understand what he was telling them. So it would be best not to explain it more.
