\v 8 Heal sick people, cause dead people to become alive, heal people with leprosy and bring them back into society, and cause demons to leave those whom they control. Do not charge any money for helping people, because God did not charge you anything for helping you.
\v 9-10 Do not take any money with you, nor a bag for what belongs to you. Do not take an extra tunic, nor sandals in addition to what you are wearing, nor a walking stick. Every worker deserves to get pay from the people for whom he works, so you deserve to receive food and a place to stay from the people to whom you go.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about what they should do when they go to preach.

  * **you...your** - This refers to the twelve apostles.
  * **gold, silver, or brass** - These are metals out of which coins were made. This list is a metonym for money, so if the metals are unknown in your area, translate the list as "money." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **purses** - This means "belts" or "money belts," but it can refer to whatever might be used to carry money. A belt is a long strip of cloth or leather worn around the waist. It was often wide enough that it could be folded and used to carry money.
  * **traveling bag** - This could either be any bag used to carry things on a journey, or a bag used by someone to collect food or money.
  * **an extra tunic** - Use the same word you used for "tunic" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:40|5:40]].
  * **laborer** - "worker"
  * **his food** - AT: "what he needs"
