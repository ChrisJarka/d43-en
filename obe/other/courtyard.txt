====== courtyard, court ======

===== Definition: =====

A courtyard is an enclosed area that is surrounded by a building or walls. It has no roof, but rather is open to the sky. Sometimes it is called a "court."

  * The temple building in Jerusalem had a courtyard around it. The walls enclosing this courtyard were made of stone. This courtyard was called the "inner courtyard."
  * The outer courtyard of the temple was outside the inner courtyard and was enclosed by the outside walls of the temple complex.
  * God's people were permitted to go into the inner courtyard to worship God, but only the priests were permitted to go into the actual temple building.
  * The "Court of the Women" was inside the outer courtyard, on the eastern end.
  * The "Court of the Gentiles" was outside the outer wall of the temple complex. It was the only place near the temple that Gentiles were permitted to be.
  * The tabernacle building was surrounded by one courtyard, which was enclosed by walls made of thick, cloth curtains rather than stone.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "courtyard" could be translated as "enclosed space" or "walled-in land" or "temple grounds" or "temple enclosure."
  * Sometimes the term "temple" can be translated as "temple courtyards" or "temple courts" when that is what is being referred to.
