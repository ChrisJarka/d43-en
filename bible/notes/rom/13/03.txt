\v 3 What rulers \add do\add* is not \add to cause people who\add* do good deeds to be afraid. Instead, \add what they do is to cause people who do\add* evil to be afraid. So, if any of you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* wants to be unafraid of officials, do what is good! \add If you\f + \ft singular \f* do good\add*, they will commend you \add instead of punishing you!\add*
\v 4 It is in order to serve God \add by doing their work that every official exists\add*, in order that they may benefit each of you. If any of you does what is evil, you\add \f + \ft singular \f* will rightfully have reason to\add* be afraid, because the authority that they have to punish people \f + \ft metonymy \f* is very real \f + \ft litotes \f*! The officials exist to serve God. That is, they act as God's agents as they punish those who do evil.
\v 5 So, it is necessary for you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* to be subject \add to officials\add*, not only because they will punish you \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add if you disobey them\add*, but also because you know within yourselves\add that you should be subject to them\add*!

\v 3 I say this, because rulers do not cause people who do good deeds to be afraid. Instead, they cause people who do evil to be afraid. So if any of you do good, they will praise you instead of punishing you!
\v 4 All officials exist in order to serve God, in order that they may help each of you. If any of you does what is evil, of course you should be afraid of them. The officials exist to serve God by punishing those who do evil.
\v 5 So, it is necessary for you to obey the officials, not only because they will punish you if you disobey them, but also because you know within yourselves that you should be subject to them!

\v 3 For rulers are not a terror to  good deeds, but to evil deeds. Do you desire to be unafraid of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from it.
\v 4 For he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for he does not carry the sword for no reason. For he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath on the one who does evil.
\v 5 Therefore you must obey, not only because of the wrath, but also because of conscience.
