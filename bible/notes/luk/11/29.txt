\v 29 When the group of people around \add Jesus\add* got larger, he said, "\add Many of\add* you people who have been observing my ministry are evil. You want \add me to perform\add* a miracle \add to prove that I have come from God\add*, but the only miracle that \add I\add* will perform for you is one \add like happened to\add* Jonah.
\v 30 \add After Jonah was inside a huge fish for three days, God performed\add* a miracle \add to bring\add* Jonah \add back to life again. Jonah went and testified about that\add* to the people in Nineveh \add city. God will perform\add* a similar miracle \add for me\add*, the one who came from heaven\add . When you people have seen that miracle, you will believe my message\add*.
\v 31 \add The\add* queen from \add Sheba\add*, \add far\add* south \add of Israel, who lived long ago\add*, traveled a long distance to hear Solomon speak \add many\add* wise things. But now \add I, a man\add* who \add is much\add* greater \add and wiser\add* than Solomon, am here, \add but you have not listened to what I have told you\add*. Therefore, at the time when \add God\add* judges \add all people\add*, the queen from \add Sheba\add* will stand there, \add along\add* with you people, and will condemn you.

\v 29  And when the crowds were gathering even more, He began to say, "This generation is evil. It seeks a sign, though no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.
\v 30  For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so too the Son of Man will be to this generation.
\v 31 The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater one than Solomon is here.
