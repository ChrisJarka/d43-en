===== Recommended Software =====

This module answers the question: Would you be so bold as to recommend any software?\\
Module – Recommended Software

The software listed in this module are our recommendations for the completing tasks in each of the respective categories. The software is selected based on design, functionality, ease of use, intuitive user interface and cost effectiveness. We are especially appreciative and gravitate toward excellent open-source or free software whenever possible, knowing that costs and licensing are typically an access barrier for the global Church.



=== File Management ===

  * **[[http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk|Bulk Rename Utility]]** - This is a powerful tool providing a tremendous degree of versatility in renaming files. Provided instructions are minimal so we have created our own covering the most common file renaming tasks for audio.

  * **[[http://www.mp3tag.de/en/download.html|Mp3Tag]]** - For writing and editing file tags/meta data, Mp3Tag is our recommendation for and intuitive, effective free program that works for mp3 and mp4 files.

  * **[[http://shareit.lenovo.com/|SHAREit]]** - This is an excellent file transfer app that makes use of a WIFI or LAN connection to transfer files (uses network connection but not internet). This app is particularly helpful in the more difficult task of transferring files between laptops and mobile devices and is significantly faster than Bluetooth.




==== Android OS ====
//Note: Audio quality results vary depending on device A/D convertors. List of field-tested devices can be found here.//

=== Recording/Editing ===

  * **[[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nchsoftware.pocketwavepad_free&hl=enWavePad|WavePad Free]]** - WavePad Free is the best free audio recording/editing app for the Android platform and is equipped with the essential tools needed for efficiency in nearly any recording/editing task. Upgrading to paid version eliminates advertising, saving to MP3 format and several other tools and option.

=== File Sharing ===

  * **[[http://shareit.lenovo.com/|SHAREit]]** - SHAREit is an excellent file transfer app that makes use of a WIFI or LAN connection to transfer files (uses network connection but not internet). This app is significantly faster than Bluetooth at transferring files.

=== Recording/Editing ===

  * **[[http://www.ocenaudio.com.br/|Ocenaudio]]** – Best free software for simple, efficient recording/editing. Intuitive interface and well-equipped for all basic voice recording tasks, recordists familiar with Adobe Audition will recognize and appreciate the speed and functionality of essential procedures in Ocenaudio. 

   * **[[http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html|Adobe Audition]]** – Best paid recording software for voice recording. New version (Adobe CC) can be expensive and user interface is far more complex than Ocenaudio. However, for advanced level editing Adobe Audition's included tools are impressive and can accomplish things free programs cannot begin to do. If a discontinued copy of Audition 3.0 is obtainable, users will find it to be the ideal balance of a simple, intuitive user interface and well-equipped tool set.

  * **[[http://audacityteam.org/download/|Audacity]]** – Free recording/editing software, yet cumbersome and lacking in design and UI features that enable productivity and efficiency when compared to Ocenaudio and Adobe Audition. However, it possesses many editing and audio restoration tools not found in Ocenaudio's basic editing toolset (although not of comparable quality to Adobe Audition) that advanced level recordists may find very useful. 
    * //**Notes:** The conventional save commands will save your recorded audio files in their proprietary format which is not useful. Be sure to use the “Export Audio” command to save files in compatible formats such as WAV (best quality) or MP3 (low quality). If you plan to edit or save files in mp3 format you will need to download and install this// [[http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#How_do_I_download_and_install_the_LAME_MP3_encoder.3F|MP3 Encoder]].
