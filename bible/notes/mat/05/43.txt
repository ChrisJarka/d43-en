\v 43 You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy:
\v 44 but I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you;
\v 45 that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends
rain on the just and the unjust.
