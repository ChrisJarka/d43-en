===== Translation Notes: =====
Isaiah continues to describe the Messiah.
  * **His delight will be the fear of the Lord** - "It will make him happy to revere Yahweh"
  * **Instead, he will judge the poor with righteousness and decide fairly for the humble of the earth** – "Instead, he will judge what is right and fair for the poor and humble."
  * **He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked** - The phrases "rod of his mouth" and "the breath of his lips" mean basically the same thing. They refer to the Messiah's power to judge the earth. This power is compared to a weapon that will kill his enemies. Alternate translation: "He will speak and judge against the wicked like he is using a weapon to kill his enemies." (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]] and [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]] and [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]]))
  * **Righteousness will be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt around his hips** – Isaiah compares the righteousness and faithfulness of the Messiah to a belt. Men wore belts around their robes when they were ready to word. This emphasizes that righteousness and faithfulness will always be with the Messiah, and he will always be ready to use them. Alternate translation: "Righteousness and faithfulness will always be with him like the belt around his waist" or "He will always be ready to do what is right and faithful before God."
