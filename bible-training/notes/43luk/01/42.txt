===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **She** – It may be more clear or more natural to say “Elizabeth” here, depending on how verse 41 was translated.
  * **raised her voice with a loud exclamation** - This can also be translated as "called out joyfully" or "she exclaimed loudly".
  * **the fruit of your womb** - This can also be translated as "the baby in your womb" or, "the baby you will bear." (See [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|Metaphor]].)
  * **How is it that the mother of my Lord should come to me?** This can also be translated "How wonderful it is that the mother  of my Lord has come to me!" Elizabeth was not asking for information. Rather she was showing how surprised and happy she was that the mother of the Lord would come to her. See (See [[:en:ta:figuresofspeech:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]].)
  * **the mother of my Lord** - This can also be translated as "you, the mother of my Lord" since this refers to Mary.
