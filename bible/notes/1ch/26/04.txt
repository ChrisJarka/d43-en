===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - This continues the list of gatekeepers which started in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:26:01|26:1]].

  * **Obed Edom** - Translate this man's name the same as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:1ch:16:37|16:38]]. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **Shemaiah ... Jehozabad ... Joah ... Sacar ... Nethanel ... Ammiel ... Issachar ... Peullethai** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the second ... the third ... the fourth ... the eighth** - "the 2nd ... the 3rd ... the 4th ... the 8th" or "number 2 ... number 3 ... number 4 ... number 8." This shows the order in which the sons were born. If it is more natural in your language, you may say "the next" for each son. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
  * **who ruled over their families** - "who were leaders in their father's family" (UDB). This means that they were leaders among their clan.
