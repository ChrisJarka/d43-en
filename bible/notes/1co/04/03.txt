====== 1 Corinthians 04:3-4 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 I am not concerned whether you or \add the judges in\add* some court decide whether I have done my work faithfully or not. I do not even judge myself \add about that\add*.
\v 4 I do not think that I have done anything wrong, but that does not prove that I have done nothing wrong. The Lord is the one who judges me.
\v 5 So stop judging any of us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* before the time \add when God judges everyone\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*! Do not judge us before the Lord comes. He is the one who will reveal the sinful things that people have done secretly. He will even reveal what people have thought in their minds. At that time God will praise each person as\add each one of them deserves\add*.

<usfm>
\v 3 If a human being, or even a court of law, judges my life, I think little about it. I am not able even to judge myself.
\v 4 I am not aware of anyone who accuses me of doing wrong. But that does not mean that I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.
\v 5 So then, you should not judge anything before it is time. The Lord will do that when he returns. He is the one who can bring to light everything that is hidden even in total darkness, and he can make a right judgment because he knows what each person truly thinks. When he comes, every one will receive whatever honor they deserve from the Lord.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 But for me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court.  For I do not even judge myself.
\v 4 I am not aware of any charge being made against me, but that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. 
\v 5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment about anything before the time, before the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his praise from God.
