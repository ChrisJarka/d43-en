====== hades, sheol, the grave ======

===== Definition: =====

The terms "hades" and "sheol" are used in the Bible to refer to death and the place where the souls of people go when they die. Their meanings are similar.

  * The term "grave" literally refers to the physical place where a dead body is buried or laid.
  * Sometimes "the grave" is used more generally and figuratively to refer to the condition of being dead or a place where dead people are.
  * The Hebrew term "sheol" is often used in the Old Testament to refer generally to the place of death. Some English versions translate it as "the grave" or "the pit" or "death." Some keep the word "sheol," spelling it to fit the sound patterns of the language of translation. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|How to Translate Unknowns]])
  * In the New Testament, the Greek term "hades" refers to a place for the souls of people who rebelled against God. These souls are referred to as going "down" to hades. This is sometimes contrasted to goind "up" to heaven, where the souls of people who believe in God live.
  * The term "hades" is coupled with the term "death" in the book of Revelation. In the end times, both death and hades will be thrown into the Lake of Fire, which is hell.
