\v 3 Because God has kindly appointed me to be his apostle, which I did not deserve, I say this to every one of you: Do not think you are better than you really are. Instead, think about yourselves in a sensible way, a way that is the same as the way in which God has allowed you to trust in him.

\v 3 For I say, because of the grace that was given to me, that everyone who is among you should not think more highly of oneself than he ought to think; but to think so as to think wisely, just as God has given out to each one a measure of faith.
