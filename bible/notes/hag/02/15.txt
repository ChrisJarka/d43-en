<usfm>
\v 15 Think about what has been happening to you before you began to lay the foundation of my temple.
\v 16 When you expected \add to harvest\add* twenty bushels of grain, \add you harvested\add* only ten bushels. When someone went to a big wine vat to get fifty gallons of wine, there were only twenty gallons in the vat.
\v 17 I sent blight\f + \ft Or: hot winds \f* and mildew and hail to destroy all your crops. But still you did not return to me.

<usfm>
\v 15 So now, think in your minds about the past leading up to this very day. Before stone was placed upon stone in the temple of Yahweh,
\v 16 how was it then? When you came to a heap of twenty measures of grain, there were only ten; and when you came to the wine vat to draw out fifty measures, there were only twenty.
\v 17 I afflicted you and all the work of your hands with blight and mildew, but you still did not turn to meâ€”this is Yahweh's declaration.
