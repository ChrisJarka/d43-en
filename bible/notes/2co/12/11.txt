====== 2 Corinthians 12:11-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 It has been foolish for me \add to talk about myself like this\add*, but it is you who forced me to do it. Truly \add if the Lord would not help me\add*, I would be worthless, \add as my opponents say that I am\add*. But none of the men whom you \add wrongfully think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* are great apostles are greater in any way than I am. So it would have been right\f + \ft Or: proper \f* for you to say good things about me.
\v 12 \add You should have done that, because\add* when I was with you \add I\add* repeatedly did the things that showed you that \add I am truly\add* an apostle, such as performing many \f + \ft doublet \f* miracles.
\v 13 And I have \add certainly treated\add* you as well as \add I treated\add* the other congregations \add that I helped to start. Or do you think that\add* by not asking you \add to pay me for my work\add*, I was not treating you as well as I treated the other congregations? It is foolish for you to\add think that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add it\add* was wrong for me not \add to ask for pay from you for my work, and therefore I should ask\add* you to forgive me for that!\f + \ft Or: Do you \add think that it\add* was wrong for me not \add to ask for pay from you for my work, and therefore I should ask\add* you to forgive me for that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 11 I am become foolish: you compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.
\v 12 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.
\v 13 For what is there wherein you were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except it be that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.
