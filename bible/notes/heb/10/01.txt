====== Hebrews 10:1-4 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Just like a shadow vaguely represents the thing that it is a shadow of, the laws that God \add gave Moses\add* only poorly represent \f + \ft metaphor \f* the good things that were to come later. Those laws were not all the good things themselves that God has promised. So, by offering the same kinds of sacrifices every year, people \f + \ft personification \f* who approach God can never become perfect\f + \ft Or: all that God intends them to be \f*.
\v 2 If God had removed the guilt for having sinned of those who brought the sacrifices, they would not feel that they were still guilty. So they would certainly have stopped offering those sacrifices!\f + \ft Or: would they not have stopped offering those sacrifices? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 3 But rather, the fact that they offer those sacrifices each year reminds them that they are still guilty for their sins.
\v 4 The principle is that blood of animals such as bulls or goats can never remove the guilt of those who have sinned.

\v 1 Just like a shadow vaguely represents the thing which casts that shadow, the laws that God gave Moses only poorly represent  the good things that were to come later. Those laws themselves were not the good things God has promised. So, by offering the same kinds of sacrifices every year, people who approach God can never become perfect .
\v 2 If God had removed the guilt for having sinned of those who brought the sacrifices, they would not feel that they were still guilty. So they would certainly have stopped offering those sacrifices!
\v 3 But rather, the fact that they offer those sacrifices each year reminds them that they are still guilty for their sins.
\v 4 The principle is that blood of animals such as bulls or goats can never remove the guilt of those who have sinned.

\v 1 For the Law casts a shadow of the good things to come, not the realities themselves, and the Law  can never with the same sacrifices year after year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.
\v 2 Or else would they not have ceased to be offered? Because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins.
\v 3 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.
\v 4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
