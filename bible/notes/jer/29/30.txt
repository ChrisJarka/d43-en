\v 30 Then Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 31 "Send this message to all the people \add from Judah\add* who are there \add in Babylon\add*: Say that this is what Yahweh says about Shemaiah, the man from Nehelam: 'I did not appoint him, but he has deceived you and caused you to believe the lies that he prophesied.
\v 32 So, I will punish him and his family. He has incited you to rebel against me. Because of that, all of his descendants will soon die. I will do many good things for you, my people, but he and his descendants will not see those things, \add because they will be dead\add*. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!'~"

\v 30 So the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 31 “Sent out to all the exiles and say, ‘Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you when I myself did not send him and led you to believe falsely,
\v 32 therefore thus says Yahweh: Look! I am visiting Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his seed! There will not be a man for him abiding in the midst of this people, and he will not see the good 
that I am doing for my people—this is Yahweh’s declaration—for he has declared apostasy against Yahweh!’”
