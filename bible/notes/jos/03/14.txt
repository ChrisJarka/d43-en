\v 14 So when the \add Israelite\add* people packed up their tents in order to cross the river, the priests who were carrying the chest containing the Ten Commandments went in front of them.
\v 15 It \add was springtime\add*, when people harvest their crops, and at that time the river floods over its banks. But as soon as the priests reached the edge of the river and stepped into the water,
\v 16 the water stopped flowing. The water piled up far \add upstream\add*, at a town named Adam, near Zarethan. The water stopped flowing down to the Dead Sea. So the people were able to cross the river near Jericho.

\v 14 And it came about, when the people prepared to cross over the Jordan, the priests that carried the Ark of the Covenant went ahead of the people.
\v 15 The priests that carried the Ark approached the Jordan. It was harvest time and the Jordan overflowed its banks. When the priests dipped their feet into the water,
\v 16 the waters that flowed down from upstream stood up in one pile. The water stopped flowing from a great distance. The waters stopped flowing from Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, all the way down to the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea. The people crossed over near Jericho.
