\v 1 And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the
mountains were mountains of brass.
\v 2 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;
\v 3 and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.
\v 4 Then I answered and said to the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?
