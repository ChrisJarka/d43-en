\v 1 Yahweh showed me and look! Tow baskets of figs were set before the temple of Yahweh after the great Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, took Jeconiah, son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, the princes of Judah, the artificer and smith from Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon.
\v 2 One basket of figs was very good, like the first of the figs, but the other basket of figs was so very bad that it could not be eaten.
\v 3 Yahweh said to me, “What are you seeing, Jeremiah?” So I said, “Figs. Good figs that are very good and bad that are so very bad they cannot be eaten.”
