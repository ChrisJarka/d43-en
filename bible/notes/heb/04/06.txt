\v 6 Some people still enter God's rest. But those Israelites who first had the good news about God's rest proclaimed to them did not enter that place of resting, because they refused to believe God.
\v 7 But God appointed another time that we may enter that place of resting. That time is now! We know that is true because much later than when the Israelites rebelled against God in the desert, he caused King David to write what I have already quoted,
\q "Now, when you understand what God is saying to you, do not stubbornly disobey him."

\p
\v 6 Therefore since God's rest is still reserved for some to enter, and many Israelites who heard the good news about his rest did not enter because of disobedience, 
\v 7 God again established a certain day,
" 'Today,' David said after a long time as it had already been said, 
\q "Today if you will hear his voice,
\q do not harden your hearts."
