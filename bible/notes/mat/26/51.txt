\v 51 And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the
high priest, and struck off his ear.
\v 52 Then says Jesus to him, Put up again your sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the
sword.
\v 53 Or think you that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?
\v 54 How then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
