\v 17 He said to me, "You human, you see \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what they are doing. \add Do you think that\add* it is not important that these men of Judah are doing these detestable things here? \add But they are doing other terrible things\add*. They are acting violently throughout their country, and continually causing me to be angry. Look at them! They are insulting me by their actions [IDI]!
\v 18 So I will show them that I am very angry. I will not pity them or act mercifully toward them. And even if they shout to me \add to help them\add*, I will not pay attention to them."

\v 17 Then he said to me, Hast you seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they
commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke
me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.
\v 18 Therefore will I also deal in wrath; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears
with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.
