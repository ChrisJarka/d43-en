=== What is the Book of Titus about? ===

Paul had instructed Titus to lead the churches that were on the island of Crete.  Paul wrote this letter in order to instruct Titus on the selecting and training of church leaders.  He gave similar instructions in his letters to Timothy.  His letter describes how church leaders should be held to a high standard.  Churches and church leaders today should pay careful attention to the standards required of those in leadership.

=== Who wrote the Book of Titus? ===

The book of Titus is one of four letters from Paul that are addressed to a person instead of a church. The other three letters are 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Philemon.  Paul was writing to Titus, but he also wrote as if the letter could be read aloud publicly.  We can know this because he explains his qualifications as an Apostle, something that Titus would have already known.  Paul probably wrote this letter sometime between 63-65 years after the birth of Christ.
