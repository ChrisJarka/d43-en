===== What is Translation? =====

The word "translation" is from the verb "to translate."

For our purposes, translation is a process performed between different languages that involves a person (the translator) changing a text from one language into a different language.

Translating can be a literal rewording of a text or or an interpretation of the concepts of a text (what we refer to as the "sense" or "significance" of the text).
