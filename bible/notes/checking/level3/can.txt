==== Clear, Accurate, Natural ====

The questions in this section will help those in the wider Christian community know if the audience finds the translation to be clear, accurate, and natural.

Q? Have you tested the translation by reading it to your community members and asking for feedback? Were you able to use this information to make the translation clearer and more easy to understand?  (Was this text tested for clarity, accuracy, and naturalness?)

Q? List a few passages where the community feedback was helpful. How did you change these passages to make them more clear?  (How was the text adjusted to make it more understandable? Explain some key terms and show how they are equal to terms used in the national language.)

Q? Has the community approved the text for content?  (Have all of the verses and events in the national language version been identified in the local language translation also?)

Q? Does the community verify that there is a good flow to the language when the passages are read out loud?  (Does the language sound like the writer was a person from your own community?)
