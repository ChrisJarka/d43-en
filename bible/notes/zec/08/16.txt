===== translationNotes: =====

  * **that you must do** - "You" refers to the people of Judah.
  * **Speak truth, every person with his neighbor** - The abstract noun "truth" can be translated using the adjective "true." AT: "Everyone must say only true things to his neighbor" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]])
  * **his neighbor** - Here "neighbor" means any person, not just someone who lives nearby.
  * **Judge with truth, justice, and peace** - The abstract nouns "truth, justice, and peace" can be translated with adverbs. AT: "Judge disputes truly, justly, and peacefully"
  * **in your gates** - Possible meanings are 1) "gates" refers to the places where judgment took place. AT: "in your places of judgment" or 2) "gates" is a synecdoche that represents cities or towns. AT: "within your towns" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **do not love false oaths** - The implied information is that this refers to oaths taken in a court of law. AT: "do not approve when people tell lies in court cases" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:zec:01:04|1:4]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
