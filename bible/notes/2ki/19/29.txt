\v 29 This will be the sign to you, Hezekiah. 
\q You will eat this year what grows by itself, 
\q and in the second year what grows from that, 
\q and in the third year you must plant and reap, and plant vineyards and eat their fruit.

\v 30 The remnant of the house of Judah who escapes 
\q will again take root in this land and bear fruit.
\q 
\v 31 For from Jerusalem a remnant will come out, 
\q and from Mount Zion will the people escape destruction. 
The zeal of Yahweh shall perform this.
