\v 7 Dear friends, I am not writing a new \add additional\add* command to you. Instead, I am writing to you a command which you have had since you first \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add believed in Christ\add*. That command is \add part of\add* the message that you have \add always\add* heard.
\v 8 Nevertheless, \add I can say that\add* the command I am writing to you is a new command. \add It is new because\add* what Christ \add did\add* was new, and what you \add are doing\add* is new, because \add you have been ceasing to conduct your lives in a morally impure manner\add* and \add are now truly conducting your lives in a pure manner. That is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* no longer \add living in\add* darkness. Instead, \add it is like\add* living where a brilliant light is already shining.

\v 7 Beloved, I do not write a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard.
\v 8 Again, a new commandment write I to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.
