\c 88
\d A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.
\q
\v 1 O Jehovah, the God of my salvation,
\q I have cried day and night before thee.
\q
\v 2 Let my prayer enter into your presence;
\q Incline your ear to my cry.
\q
\v 3 For my soul is full of troubles,
\q And my life draweth near to Sheol.
\q
\v 4 I am reckoned with them that go down into the pit;
\q I am as a man that has no help,
\q
\v 5 Cast off among the dead,
\q Like the slain that lie in the grave,
\q Whom you remember no more,
\q And they are cut off from your hand.
\q
\v 6 You have laid me in the lowest pit,
\q In dark places, in the deeps.
\q
\v 7 Your wrath lies hard upon me,
\q And you have afflicted me with all your waves. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 8 You have put mine acquaintance far from me;
\q You have made me an abomination to them:
\q I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
\q
\v 9 Mine eye wastes away by reason of affliction:
\q I have called daily upon thee, O Jehovah;
\q I have spread forth my hands to thee.
\q
\v 10 Wilt you show wonders to the dead?
\q Shall they that are deceased arise and praise thee? \qs [Selah\qs*
\q
\v 11 Shall your lovingkindness be declared in the grave?
\q Or your faithfulness in Destruction?
\q
\v 12 Shall your wonders be known in the dark?
\q And your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
\q
\v 13 But to thee, O Jehovah, have I cried;
\q And in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.
\q
\v 14 Jehovah, why throw you off my soul?
\q Why hide you your face from me?
\q
\v 15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up:
\q While I suffer your terrors I am distracted.
\q
\v 16 Your fierce wrath is gone over me;
\q Your terrors have cut me off.
\q
\v 17 They came round about me like water all the day long;
\q They compassed me about together.
\q
\v 18 Lover and friend have you put far from me,
\q And mine acquaintance into darkness.
