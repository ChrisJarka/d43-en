===== Training Before Translation Begins =====

This module answers the question: What should I know about translation before I start?\\
Before you start this module have you learned about:
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_process|The Translation Process]]
  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_why|Why We Translate the Bible]]

There are many decisions that you must make in agreement with the language community about how to write your language before you begin translating. Please see [[en:ta:vol1:process:writing_decisions|writing decisions]].



Next we recommend you learn about: [[en:ta:vol1:checking:writing_decisions|Decisions for Writing Your Language]]
