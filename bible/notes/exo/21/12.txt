\v 12 You must execute anyone who strikes another person with the result that the person who is struck dies.

\v 14 But if someone gets angry with another person and kills him, even if the murderer runs to the altar, \add a place that God designated as a place to be safe\add*, you must execute him.

\v 14 But if someone gets angry with another person and kills him, even if the murderer runs to the altar, you must kill him.

\v 12 Whoever strikes a man so that he dies, that person shall surely be put to death.
\v 13 If a man did not do it with premeditation, but instead it happened by accident, then I will appoint a place where he may flee.
\v 14 If a man willfully attacks his neighbor to kill him deceitfully, then you will take him even from my altar, that he may die.
