\v 6 So, \add because God's Spirit lives in us\add*, we are always confident \add that God will give us new bodies\add*. We know that as long as we live in our bodies here on \add earth\add*, we are not yet \add living together\add* with the Lord \add Jesus in heaven\add*.
\v 7 While we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* live \add here, we\add* do not have our \add new bodies, but we are\add* trusting \add that God will give them to us\add*.
\v 8 \add As I said\add*, we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are confident \add that he will give us new bodies\add*. We\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* would much prefer to leave these bodies \add in which we are now living\add*, and be with the Lord \add Jesus in our\add* home in \add heaven\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 We are sure and we know that as long as we live in our bodies on the earth, we are away from Lord, who is in heaven
\v 7 (by our trust him we live our lives, and not by what we can see).
\v 8 Because we have put our trust in him, we would much rather give up our bodies so we could be at home with the Lord.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 Therefore always be confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord
\v 7 (for we walk by faith, not by sight).
\v 8 So we have confidence and we would rather be away from the body and to be at home with the Lord.
