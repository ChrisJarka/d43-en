====== Trance ======

A state of revelation, to imply that one is "beside oneself." Greek root suggests a change of place. Luke is clear that this trance is a vehicle of revelation induced by Almighty God to convey a message. Both Peter and Paul were in prayer when the revelation came to them. This was clearly intended to imply that this was an act of God.
