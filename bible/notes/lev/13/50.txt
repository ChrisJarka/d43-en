\v 50 The priest will examine it, and then put it in a separate place by itself for seven days.

\v 50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up that which has the plague seven days:
\v 51 and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.
\v 52 And he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in woollen or in linen, or anything of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.
