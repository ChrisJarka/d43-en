\7v 3 When I saw that you did not save me, I took my life in my hands and passed over against the people of Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand. Is that why you have come up to me today to fight against me?”
\v 4 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim; the men of Gilead struck Ephraim down, because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh.”
