\v 32 Nor for your sake do I this, says the Lord Jehovah, be it known to you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.
\v 33 Thus says the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.
\v 34 And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.
