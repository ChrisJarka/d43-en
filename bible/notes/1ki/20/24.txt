\v 24 And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their room;
\v 25 and number you an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight
against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he listened to their voice, and did so.
