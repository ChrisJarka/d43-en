====== Beersheba ======

===== Facts: =====

Beersheba was an Old Testament city located about 45 miles southwest of Jerusalem.

  * When Abraham sent them out of his camp, Beersheba was the wilderness area where Hagar and her son Ishmael, Abraham's son, wandered until God saved them.
  * Abraham dug a well in an area that was seized by Abimelech's men. Abimelech and Abraham made peace after Abraham swore an oath to not retaliate for the action of Abimelech's men. From this oath, Beersheba got its name.
