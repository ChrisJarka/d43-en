<usfm>
\v 14 So allow our leaders to decide for all of us what we should do. Tell everyone who has married a woman who is not Israelite to come at a time that you decide. They should come with the elders and judges from each city. If we do that, our God will stop being angry with us \add because of what we have done\add*."
\p
\v 15 Jonathan the son of Asahel, Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah, and Meshullam and Shabbethai, a descendant of Levi, were the only ones who objected to this.

\v 14 Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign
women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our
God be turned from us, until this matter be despatched.
\v 15 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this
matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
