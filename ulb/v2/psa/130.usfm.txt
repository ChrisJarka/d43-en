\c 130
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q
\v 1 Out of the depths have I cried to thee, O Jehovah.
\q
\v 2 Lord, hear my voice:
\q Let your ears be attentive
\q To the voice of my supplications.
\q
\v 3 If thou, Jehovah, should mark iniquities,
\q O Lord, who could stand?
\q
\v 4 But there is forgiveness with thee,
\q That you may be feared.
\q
\v 5 I wait for Jehovah, my soul does wait,
\q And in his word do I hope.
\q
\v 6 My soul waits for the Lord
\q More than watchmen wait for the morning;
\q Yea, more than watchmen for the morning.
\q
\v 7 O Israel, hope in Jehovah;
\q For with Jehovah there is lovingkindness,
\q And with him is plenteous redemption.
\q
\v 8 And he will redeem Israel
\q From all his iniquities.
