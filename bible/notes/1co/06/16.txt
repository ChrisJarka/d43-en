===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 You understand that the man who has relations with a prostitute, just as in marriage, becomes one flesh with her. As scripture says about marriage, "The two will become one flesh."
\v 17 We who are joined spiritually to the Lord become one with him, in some ways like marriage. We are united with him as a wife is united with her husband, Christians are united with Christ as the head of the church.
