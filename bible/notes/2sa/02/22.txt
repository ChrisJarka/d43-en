\v 22 And Abner said again to Asahel, "Turn aside from pursuing me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then
could I hold up my face to Joab your brother?"
\v 23 But he refused to turn aside and then Abner with the blunt end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the
spear came out behind him. And then he fell down and died there. And it came to pass, that anyone who came to the
place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.
