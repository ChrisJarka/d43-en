\v 7 A horde of all the nations will fight against Ariel and her stronghold. They will
 attack her and it  will be like a dream, a vision of the night.
\v 8 It will be like when a hungry man dreams he is  eating, but  when he awakes, his stomach is empty.  It will be as when a
thirsty man dreams that he is drinks, but he when he awakes, he is fainting, with his thirst unquenched.   Yes so will
the horde of  nations be, that fight against Mount Zion.
