====== John 07:17-18 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 Those who choose to do what God wants will find out whether what I teach comes from God or whether I am speaking with \add only\add* my own \add authority\add*.
\v 18 Those who speak with \add only\add* their own \add authority\add* do that \add only\add* so that others will honor them. But I am \add doing things so that others\add* will honor the one who sent me, and I am someone who speaks the truth. I never lie.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 If anyone chooses to do what God wants, he will find out whether what I teach comes from God or if I speak only by my own authority.
\v 18 Anyone who speaks on his own authority speaks so others will honor only him. But if a servant works hard to honor the person who sent him, to give him a good reputation as a man of integrity, there is no fault in that kind of a servant.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 17 If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or
whether I speak from myself.
\v 18 He that speaks from himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks the glory of him that sent him, the same is
true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
</usfm>
