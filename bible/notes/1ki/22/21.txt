\v 21 Then a spirit came forward who stood before Yahweh and said, 'I will entice him.'
\v 22 So Yahweh said to him, 'How?' The spirit replied, 'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' Yahweh replied, 'You will be the one to entice him, and you will be successful also. Go now and do as you have described.'
\v 23 Now therefore, see that Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets, and Yahweh has spoken
disaster concerning you."
