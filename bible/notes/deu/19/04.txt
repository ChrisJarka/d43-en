\v 4 And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee there and live: whoso kills his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past;
\v 5 as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, so that he dieth; he shall flee to one of these cities and live:
