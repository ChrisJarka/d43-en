===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:en:obe:kt:woe|Woe]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:iniquity|iniquity]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:sin|sin]]
  * [[:en:obe:kt:holyone|Holy One of Israel]]

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **to those who pull along iniquity with cords of emptiness and sin with a cart rope** - These phrases mean basically the same thing. They compare people who continue to sin on purpose to a person using all his effort to keep pulling a cart along. The word "emptiness" means it is all in vain. God will judge them and they will come to nothing. Alternate translation: "to those who work hard to sin like a person dragging a cart by a rope." 
    * **those who say** - This refers to those who continue sinning and then challenge God to stop them. Alternate translation: "those who challenge God and say"  
    * **let the plans of the Holy One of Israel take shape and come** - "let the Holy One of Israel accomplish his plans"
