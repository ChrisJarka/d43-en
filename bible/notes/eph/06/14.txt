\v 14 So stand against the devil by clothing yourself with God's truth and righteousness, as if they were pieces of armor you put on to do battle.

\v 16 In addition, keep trusting firmly in the Lord. That will enable you to protect yourselves from anything that Satan, the evil one, may do to harm you spiritually, just like soldiers carry shields to protect themselves against the arrows that have flaming tips that their enemies shoot at them .
