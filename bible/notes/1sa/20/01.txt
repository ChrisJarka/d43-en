\v 1 And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?
\v 2 And he said to him, Far from it; you shall not die: behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he
discloseth it to me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.
