    * **but in the end she is bitter as wormwood** - AT: "but in the end she will taste really bad" or "but later she will cause pain" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **wormwood** - A plant that tastes bitter.
    * **a shart two-edged sword** - This means that the blade is sharp on both ends, making it extra dangerous.
