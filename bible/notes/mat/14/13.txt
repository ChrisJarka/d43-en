===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus went to an isolated place after John the Baptist was killed.

  * **Now when Jesus heard this**  - The original language does not have an object. A literal translation would be "Now when Jesus heard." The implied information is "Now when Jesus heard what happened to John" or Now when Jesus heard the news about John." (See: Implicit and Explicit Information)
  * **he withdrew**  - "he left" or "he went away"
  * **from there**  - The text does not say where Jesus was when he heard the news about John, so your translation should leave it unspecific as "from there" or "from that place."
  * **to an isolated place**  - "to a desolate place" or "to a place where no one lived" (UDB)
  * **When the crowds heard of it**  - "Of it" might mean "that Jesus had departed" or it might mean "of where Jesus went." The original language does not have an object. A literal translation would be "When the crowds heard."
  * **the crowds **- "the crowds of people" or "the people"
  * **on foot**  - "by walking" or "by land"
  * **cities **- "towns"
  * **Then Jesus came before them and saw the large crowd **- This could be translated as "When Jesus came ashore, he saw a large crowd."
  * **He had compassion**  - The text literally means "His inward parts were stirred up." There may be a comparable expression in the target language. "Compassion" means "pity" or "sympathy."
  * **healed their sick**  - "healed their sick people" or "healed the sick people who were among them" (UDB).
