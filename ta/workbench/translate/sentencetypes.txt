==== Description ====

A **sentence** is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. The basic types of sentences are listed below with the functions they are mainly used for.

  * **Declarative Sentence** or **Statement**  - These are mainly used to give information. '//This is a fact.//'
  * **Interrogative Sentence** or **Question**  - These are mainly used to ask for information. '//Do you know him?//'
  * **Exclamatory Sentence** or **Exclamation**  - These are mainly used to express a strong feeling. '//Ouch, that hurt!//'
  * **Imperative Sentence**  - These are mainly used for commands or instructions. '//Pick that up.//'

**Reasons this is a translation Issue**
  * Languages have different ways of showing that a sentence has a particular function. 
  * Some languages use these sentence types for more than one function. 
  * A sentence in the Bible may have a certain sentence type and function, but some languages would not use that type for that function.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

The examples below show each of these types used for their main functions.

With a **command**, the speaker uses his authority and tells someone to do something.

With a **request**, the speaker uses politeness to say that he wants someone to do something. This may include the word 'please' to make it clear that it is a request and not a command.
>Give us today our daily bread. The speaker is asking for something. (Matthew 6:11 ULB)

>Please excuse me. (Luke 14:18 ULB)

With an **invitation**, the speaker uses politeness or friendliness to suggest that someone do something if he wants.
>Come with us and we will do you good. (Numbers 10:29)

With an **instruction**, the speaker tells someone how to do something.
