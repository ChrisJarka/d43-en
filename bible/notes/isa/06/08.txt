  * **the voice of the Lord say** - Here "voice" represents the Lord himself. AT: "the Lord say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **Whom shall I send** - It is implied that Yahweh would send someone to speak his message to the people of Israel. AT: "Whom shall I send to be a messenger to my people" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **who will go for us** - It seems "us" refers to Yahweh and the members of his heavenly council. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
  * **this people** - "the people of Israel"
  * **but do not understand ... but do not perceive** - The commands "do not understand" and "do not perceive" describe the effect that Isaiah's message would have on the people. It will make them even less able to understand what Yahweh is saying to them. AT: "but you will not understand ... but you will not understand" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_imperative]])
