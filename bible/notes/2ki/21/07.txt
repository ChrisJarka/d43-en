\v 7 He placed the statue of the goddess Asherah in the temple, the place about which Yahweh had said to David and his son Solomon, "My temple will be here in Jerusalem. This is the city that I have chosen from all the territory of the twelve tribes of Israel, where I want people to worship me, forever.
\v 8 And if the Israelite people obey all my commands and all the laws that I gave to Moses, the man who served me \add very well\add*, I will not again force them to leave this land that I gave to their ancestors."
\v 9 But the people did not heed Yahweh. And Manasseh persuaded them to commit sins that are more evil than the sins that were committed by the people of the nations that Yahweh had expelled from the land as the Israelite people advanced.

\v 9 But the people did not pay attention to Yahweh. Manasseh lied and misled them so that they committed sins that were more evil than the sins that were committed by the people of the nations that Yahweh had driven out of the land before the people of Israel.

\v 7 He put the carved figure of Asherah that he had made in the house of Yahwehâ€” the house about which Yahweh had spoken to David and Solomon his son, and he said, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever.
\v 8 I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore out of the land that I gave to their ancestors, if only they will be careful to obey all that I have commanded them, and to follow all the Law which my servant Moses commanded them."
\v 9 But they did not listen, and Manasseh led them astray to do evil, even more than the nations that Yahweh had destroyed before the people of Israel.
