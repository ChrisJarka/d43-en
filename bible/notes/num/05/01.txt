\v 1 And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that has an issue, and whoever is unclean by the dead:
\v 3 both male and female shall you put out, without the camp shall you put them; that they defile not their camp, in the midst whereof I dwell.
\v 4 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp; as Jehovah spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel.
