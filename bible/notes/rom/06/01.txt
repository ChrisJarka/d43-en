<usfm> \v 1 Someone might \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* say \add in reply to what I have written\add* that \add since God acted kindly toward us\add* in a way we did not deserve \add because we sinned\add*, perhaps we should continue to sin in order that he may continue to act even more kindly toward us \add and keep on forgiving us\add*.\f + \ft Or: should we continue to sin in order that he may continue to act even more kindly toward us \add and keep on forgiving us\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \v 2 \add I would reply\add*, No, certainly not! We \add ought to consider that\add* our sinful desires \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add cannot make us do what they want us to do\add*, \add just like we cannot make\add* a corpse do what we want it to do. So it is not right that we continue to sin!\f + \ft Or: how can we continue to sin? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \v 3 When we were baptized \f + \ft Or:\add asked someone to\add* baptize us \f* in order to show that we have a relationship with \f + \ft Or: are united to \f* Jesus Christ, our \add being baptized was to declare that it was as though\add* we died with Christ. \add I want\add* you to remember that!\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 1 Someone might say in reply to what I have written that since God has acted kindly toward us, perhaps we should continue to sin in order that he may continue forgive us. \v 2 I would reply: No, certainly not! We are like people who have died, who can no longer do anything evil. So we should not continue to sin. \v 3 When we were baptized in union with Christ Jesus, God viewed us as dying with Christ on his cross. Do you not know this? </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \c 6 \p \v 1 What then will we say? Should we continue in sin so that grace may abound? \v 2 May it never be. We who died to sin, how can we still live in it? \v 3 Do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? </usfm>
