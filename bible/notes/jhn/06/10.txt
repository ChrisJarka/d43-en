\v 10  The place where the people were all coming together had a lot of grass. So Jesus said, "Tell the people to sit down." So they all sat down. And after they counted the crowd, they found there were about five thousand people there.
\v 11 Then Jesus took the small loaves of bread and the fish and he thanked God for them. Then he passed the bread and the fish among all who were sitting on the ground. The people ate all the fish and bread they wanted.
\v 12 When everyone had finished eating, he said to the disciples, "Gather up all the pieces of barley bread that the people did not eat. Do not let anything go to waste."

\v 10 Jesus said, "Make the people sit down." (Now there was much grass in the place.) So the men sat down, about five thousand in number.
\v 11 Then Jesus took the loaves and after giving thanks, he distributed to those that were sitting. He then distributed the fish in the same way, as much as they wanted.
\v 12 When they were filled, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the broken pieces which remain, so that nothing is wasted."
