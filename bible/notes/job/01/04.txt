\v 5 When each celebration ended, Job would summon them and bless them. He would get up early in the morning and kill animals and burn them on the altar as sacrifices, one for each of his children. For Job said, "Perhaps my children have sinned and said something evil about God in their hearts."

\v 4 His sons would hold a feast in the house of each one on his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
\v 5 And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and consecrate them. He would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all, for Job said, "Perhaps my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts." Thus did Job continually.
