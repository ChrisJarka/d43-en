====== Ark of the Covenant ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Old Testament, the Ark of the Covenant was a wooden chest, overlaid with gold, that was placed inside the most holy place of the tabernacle (and later, the temple), where the high priest would meet with God on behalf of the people.

  * God told the Israelites to put certain objects in the ark to remind them of his covenant with them: the two stone tablets with the ten commandments written on them, Aaron's staff and a jar of manna.
  * When God desired to speak to Israel through Moses in the tabernacle and when Israel's high priest presented appropriate sacrifices at the temple, God's presence would appear over the ark..
  * The ark of the covenant reappears in heaven in Revelation 11:19.
