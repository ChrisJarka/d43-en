  * **longing to see you** - "wanting very much to see you"
  * **remembering your tears** - Paul uses "tears" to mean suffering. AT: "keeping all the things that you have suffered in my mind" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **may be filled with joy** - Paul speaks of Timothy as if he were a container that could be filled. AT: "have much joy" or "be very joyful" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **having been reminded** - "because I have been reminded" or "when I have been reminded" or "for I have been reminded"
  * **your genuine faith** - "your faith that is real" or "your faith that is not pretended." It refers to being honest or true.
  * **faith...which lived first in your grandmother...lives in you also** - Timothy's grandmother was a devout woman, and Paul is comparing Timothy's faith to his grandmother's faith.
