\v 29 Now Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran to the man who was out at the road by the spring.
\v 30 When he had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister, "This is what  the man said to me," he went to the man, and, behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
