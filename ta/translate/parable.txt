====== parables ======

Concepts translated as "parable" include narrative stories, metaphors, similes, proverbs and even riddles. When you encounter a parable, know that the intent is to convey meaning through a story or word picture. A parable is not an actual account of an event; it is more like an imaginary example (e.g. This could happen). It can be used to explain the kingdom of Heaven by telling a story which the listeners can understand.  Because the lesson comes in the form of a story, the listener or reader can feel themselves being a part of it; it is more likely to make an impact on their lives.

===== Translation Suggestions =====
Parables or teaching stories are best translated as closely as possible to the way they were originally told. Because the parables are set in the culture of Bible times, there may be things that are not easily understood by a modern audience. Even the people who originally heard these teaching stories did not understand everything in them. And when Jesus told a parable, he did not always intend for his hearers to understand it (for example, the parable of the farmer planting seeds).

Do __not__ try to explain the story or what Jesus was teaching, but simply translate the parable. Your language may have a way of communicating that a narrative is a story (or even a story whose purpose is to teach something) and not an account of a historical event.

Parable are best translated as a situation that can be understood within your own culture. The culture of the Biblical writer impacts any parable, so full understanding of the parable prior to translation is necessary to accurately convey the message of a parable.

Parables seldom (if ever) contain the names of specific individuals (That may be a key for you in identifying what is a parable vs what is a narrative account.)
