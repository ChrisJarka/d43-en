====== Babel ======

===== Facts: =====

Babel was a chief city in a region called Shinar, later to become known as Babylonia, founded by Nimrod, the grandson of Ham.

  * Ham was one of Noah's three sons mentioned in flood and post-flood scripture.
  * Nimrod was a great and well-known warrior who ruled the region of Shinar, and established the city of Babel along with at least two other great cities, Erech and Accad.
  * Because the people settled in this area and did not spread out as God commanded, He confused their language so that they could not understand one another, and thus they were forced to scatter across the earth.
  * The word "Babel" has the Hebrew root "confusion," and the language confusion God gave the people is how "Babel" got its name.
