\v 11 I tell you truly that many other non-Jewish people will believe in me also, and they will come from distant countries, including those far to the east and far to the west, and they will sit down to eat with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when God will rule over everything completely.
\v 12 But the Jews who should have allowed God to rule over them--God will throw them into hell, where there is total darkness. There they will weep because of their suffering, and they will grind their teeth because they will have severe pain."
\v 13 Then Jesus said to the officer, "Go home. What you believed would happen, that I would heal your servant from a distance, will happen." Then the officer went home and found out that his servant had become well at the exact time that Jesus told him that he would heal him.

\v 11 I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, and will recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 12 But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness,  where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."
\v 13 Jesus said to the centurion, "Depart! As you have believed,
so may it be done for you." And the servant was healed at that very hour.

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus' healing the Roman centurion's servant.

  * **you** - This refers to "those who were following him" ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:08|8:10]]) and so is plural.
  * **from the east and the west** - This is a merism: everywhere not east of a given point is west. This can be translated as "from everywhere" or "from far away in every direction." (See: [[en:ta:translate:merism|]])
  * **recline at table** - People in that culture would lie down beside the table while eating. This custom is used as a metonym for living together as family and friends. This can be translated as "live as family and friends with." (See: [[en:ta:translate:Metonymy]])
  * **the sons of the kingdom will be thrown** - "God will throw the sons of the kingdom" (See: [[en:ta:translate:Active]])
  * **the sons of the kingdom** - The idiom "sons of" refers to those who belong to something, in this case the kingdom of God. There is also irony here because the "sons" will be thrown out while the strangers will be welcomed. This can be translated as "those who should have allowed God to rule over them" (see UDB).  (See: [[en:ta:translate:Idiom]])
  * **the outer darkness** - This metonym refers to the eternal destiny of those who reject God. "the dark place away from God." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy|]])
  * **grinding of teeth** - This metonym speaks of putting the teeth together because of great pain. (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **so may it be done for you** - "so I will do it for you." (See: [[en:ta:translate:Active]])
  * **the servant was healed **- "Jesus healed the servant." (See: [[en:ta:translate:Active]])
  * **at that very hour** - "at the exact time Jesus said he would heal the servant."
