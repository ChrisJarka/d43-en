====== Gender Notations ======

Gender means making a distinction between the masculine, feminine and neutral nouns.  The English language does not make a distinction in noun gender the way some languages do. Instead, any gender markings (such as pronouns) take the natural gender of the object.

"Whomever" is neither masculine nor feminine. The same is true for 'it'; however, 'it' is not a word English uses for people.

Sometimes English uses "them/themselves" as a gender neutral marking; however, this changes the number of the noun from singular to plural.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

Many languages of the world mark gender for all nouns (whether or not they have a natural gender) and this gender marking does not always align with the object's natural gender.  All of the original languages of the Bible marked gender.

**I'm not sure Wycliffe's standing on gendered translation.  Choose one of the following, depending on doctrine:**

In order to keep with the spirit of the original translation, gendered languages should follow the gender of the original language.

In order to keep with the spirit of the Bible being for all people, use gender neutral or inclusive markings when possible.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

Matt 7:24 Therefore, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: (King James Version)

In this case, the original Greek word for man was 'aner'. Some English translators have translated it person; however, the gender neutral Greek term was 'anthropos'. 'Aner' had the connotation of male gender.
