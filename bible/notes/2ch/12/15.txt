\v 15 As for the other matters concerning Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the writings of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, which also have records of genealogies and the constant wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam?
\v 16 Rehoboam slept with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David; Abijah his son became king in his place.

  * **are they not written ... Jeroboam?** - This can be expressed in active form and assumes that the answer is positive. The question is rhetorical and is used for emphasis.

  * **Shemaiah ... Iddo ... Abijah** - These are the names of men. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **the constant wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam** - The names of the kings means that there was war between the armies of Rehoboam and Jeroboam. AT: "the wars in which Rehoboam's army and Jeroboam's army constantly engaged" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **Rehoboam slept with his ancestors** - Rehoboam dying is spoken of as if he had fallen asleep. AT: "Rehoboam died" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
  * **was buried in the city of David** - This can be stated in active form. AT: "people buried him in the city of David" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
