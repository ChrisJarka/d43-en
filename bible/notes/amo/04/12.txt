\v 12 Therefore thus will I do to thee, O Israel; and because I will do this to thee, prepare to meet your God, O
Israel.
\v 13 For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declares to man what is his thought; that makes
the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the Earthâ€” Jehovah, the God of hosts, is his name.
