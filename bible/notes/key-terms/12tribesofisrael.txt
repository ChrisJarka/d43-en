====== twelve tribes of Israel ======

===== Definition: =====

The twelve tribes of Israel refer to the descendants of Jacob, who was also known as "Israel".

  * Jacob was the grandson of Abraham, and God changed Jacob's name to Israel. Both the name "Jacob" and the name "Israel" refer to the same person.
  * When the Israelites took possession of the land of Canaan, it was divided among the twelve tribes.
  * The descendants of Jacob's son Levi did not receive any assigned region of land so that they could work as priests for the people.
  * Jacob's son Joseph received a double inheritance because his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh were counted as Jacob's own sons and each of them received their own tribal property as the other tribes did.
