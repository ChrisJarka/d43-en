===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to question the religious leaders about the Messiah.

  * **If David then calls the Christ 'Lord', how is he David's son?** - AT: "David calls him Lord, so the Christ has to be more than just a descendant of David" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])  Just as the word "son" in, "David's son...", must be translated with the best word in your language for "son," so also the phrase "Son of God" must be translated clearly. Jesus is the "Son of God"
