====== John 14 General Notes ======

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== "My Father's house" ==
This is not a reference to the temple. Instead, it is a reference to the dwelling place of God in heaven. 

== Comforter ==
This is another name for the [[:En:obe:kt:holyspirit|Holy Spirit]], along with the "Spirit of Truth." He was already present in the world, but would come in a special way, to dwell in the hearts of christians, permanently. Jesus and the Holy Spirit are both God, because of this fact, it can be said that Jesus will live in the hearts of christians after his death.

=== Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

== Translating conditionals ==
Jim, I think that we could put something here about how to translate different types of conditional sentences (cf. v. 14, 15, 23)
