I will do awesome things for you \add all\add*.
\v 11-12 \add Each Israelite\add* person must obey what I am commanding you this day. Do not forget that \add if you do that\add*, I will expel the Amor, Canaan, Heth, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus people-groups \add from the land\add*. But be careful that you do not make any \add peace\add* agreements with any of the people who live in the land into which you are going, because if you \add do that\add*, \add you will begin to do the evil things that they do\add*. It will be \add like\add* falling into a trap.
