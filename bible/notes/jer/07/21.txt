\q1 "Take away \f + \ft irony \f* your offerings that you bring to burn completely on your altars and your other sacrifices;
\q2 \add don't give them to me\add*; eat them yourselves!

\v 22 When I led your ancestors out of Egypt,
\q2 it was not offerings to be completely burned on the altar or other sacrifices that I wanted from them.
\q1
\v 23 What I told them was, 'Obey me;
\q2 if you do that, I will be your God and you will be my people.
\q1 If you do the things that I want you to do,
\q2 everything will go well for you.'
\q1

\v 21 Therefore, this is what Yahweh, commander of the armies of angels, the God of Israel, says: "Take away your offerings that you bring to burn completely on your altars and your other sacrifices;
do not give them to me; eat them yourselves!
\v 22 When I led your ancestors out of Egypt, it was not offerings to be completely burned on the altar or other sacrifices that I wanted from them.
\v 23 What I told them was, 'Obey me; if you do that, I will be your God and you will be my people. If you do the things that I want you to do, everything will go well for you.'

\v 21 Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel says this, 'Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and the meat from them.
\v 22 For when I brought your ancestors out from the land of Egypt, I did not require anything from them. I gave them no command about matters of burnt offerings and sacrifices.
\v 23 I only gave them this command, "Listen to my voice, and I will be your God and you will be my people. So walk in all the ways that I am commanding you, so that it may go well with you."

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues giving Jeremiah his message to the people of Judah.
  * **General Information:** - In these verses, "you" and "your" refer to the people of Judah.

  * **Yahweh of hosts ... says this** - Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. Translate as in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:06:06|6:6]].
  * **Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and the meat from them** - This is an ironic statement emphasizing that none of their sacrifices were acceptable to Yahweh. AT: "Go ahead and eat the burnt offerings along with your sacrifices and meat from them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **Listen to my voice** - Here listening to Yahweh's voice means to both hear his words and obey what he says. AT: "Hear and obey what I say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **walk in all the ways that I am commanding you** - Yahweh speaks of obeying his commands as if one were walking in them, like person would walk along a road. AT: "do everything that I am commanding you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
