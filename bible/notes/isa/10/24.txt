This emphasizes that the army is the king's weapon that he uses to attack other nations. Alternate translation: "The king will send his army to harm you." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **as the  Egyptians did** - The full meaning can be made explicit: "as the Egyptians harmed your ancestors many years ago." (See: [[en:ta:translate:implicitexplicit]])
