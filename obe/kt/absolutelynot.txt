====== may it never be, God forbid, absolutely not ======

===== Definition: =====

These three phrases are used to emphasize that something is not true or that there is a strong desire for something to never happen.

  * Often these terms are used in response to a rhetorical question.(See: rhetorical question]])â€‹
  * When used by Paul, this is the strongest way of saying that what he is speaking about can never happen or must never happen.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The literal text is, "May this never come to be" or "May it be far from God that I should do this!"
  * The term "Absolutely not!" could be translated as, "That is completely impossible!" or "Of course that is not true!"
  * If Paul says, "May it never be that I should sin," he means it is his fervent desire and wish that he not sin. This could be translated as, "May God help me to never do that!"
