====== Malachi 03:1-3 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says this: "Look\f + \ft Or: Listen \f*! I am about to send my messenger who will prepare \add the people to receive me\add* when I come. You \add claim that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* you are wanting to see me, and I will suddenly come to my temple. The messenger \add who will tell you about a new\add* agreement, the one whom you are eagerly \f + \ft sarcasm \f* awaiting, is certainly going to come to you."
\p
\v 2 But will anyone \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be able to survive when he comes? Will anyone \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be able to remain standing in front of him? \add Probably not\add*, because he will be like \f + \ft simile \f* a blazing fire that refines\f + \ft Or: purifies \f* \add metal\f + \ft Or: gold \f*\add*. He will be like \f + \ft simile \f* a very strong soap \add that bleaches clothes\add*.
\v 3 \add He will be like a worker\add* who sits \add in front of his work\add* to cause silver to become pure by burning all the impurities. Like \add a worker refines\add* silver and gold, he will cause the descendants of Levi\f + \ft Or: priests \f* to become pure, \add in order that they will again become acceptable to\add* offer sacrifices that will be acceptable to him.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, says this: "Look, I will soon send a messenger to you, who will get you ready to welcome me. Then I, the Lord, whom you say you desire to come, will appear suddenly in my temple—I myself, with whom you have covenant that you say you take pleasure in—I myself am coming.
\p
\v 2 But none of you will truly be able to stay the same when I come. For I will declare no one innocent when I come. I will act life a fire that burns hot enough to refine copper; I will act like the strong soap that launderymen use to clean anything.
\v 3 I will judge you; I will be like a silversmith who makes his silver pure, free from all impurities. I will make all of you like pure gold or silver. Then I, Yahweh, will accept your offerings that you will bring me, because you will be righteous."

\c 3
\p
\v 1 "See, I am about to send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his
temple; and the messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight, see, he is coming," says Yahweh of Hosts.
\p
\v 2 But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like
fullers’ soap.
\v 3 He will sit to judge as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi. He will refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings of righteousness to Yahweh.
