\v 1 Then Yahweh said to me, "Even if Moses or Samuel were standing in front of me, I would still not be in favor of this people. Send them out from before me, for them to go away.
\v 2 It will happen that they will say to you, 'Where should we go?' Then you must say to them, 'Yahweh says this:
\q Those destined for death should go to death; those destined for the sword should go to the sword.
\q Those destined for famine should go to famine; and those destined for captivity should go to captivity.'

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **General Information:** - Jeremiah has just been praying to Yahweh.

  * **were standing in front of me, I would still not be in favor of this people** - This implies that they are pleading for Yahweh to spare the people. AT: "were standing in front of me pleading for these people, I would still not be in favor of them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Send them out from before me, for them to go away** - Yahweh repeats this idea of sending away his people to add emphasis to it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **should go to death** - This speaks of dying as if death were a place that people can go to. AT: "should die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **those destined for the sword should go to the sword** - Here the "sword" represents war. To be "destined for the sword" means to be destined to die in war. AT: "those destined to die in wars, should go to war" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **Those destined for famine should go to famine** - This means that these people are destined to die because of famine. This speaks of dying by famine as if "famine" were a place that people can go to. AT: "Those destined to die by famine should go and die by famine" or "Those destined to die by famine should go and do so" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **should go to captivity** - "should go into captivity"
