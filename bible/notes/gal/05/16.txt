===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 \add So\add* I tell you this: Constantly let \add God's\add* Spirit direct you. \add If you do that\add*, you will certainly not do the things that your self-directed nature wants \add you to do\add*.
\v 17 Your self-directed nature opposes \add God's\add* Spirit\f + \ft Or: does not \add want you to do what\add* God's Spirit \add wants you to do\add* \f*, but also his Spirit opposes your self-directed nature. These two are always fighting with\f + \ft Or: opposing \f* each other. The result is that you do not \add constantly\add* do the \add good\add* deeds that you truly desire \add to do\add*.
\v 18 But when you are led by God's Spirit \f + \ft Or:when God's Spirit directs you \f*, you \add can do what pleases God\add*, now that you are no longer obligated \add to obey all\add* the laws \add that God gave Moses\add*.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 So I tell you this: Always let God's Spirit lead you. If you do that, you will not sin, as normal human beings want to do.
\v 17 When you want to sin, you go aginst God's Spirit. And God's Spirit goes against what normal humans want. These two are always fighting against each other. The result is that you do not always do the good things that you truly desire to do.
\v 18 But when God's Spirit leads you, the Law does not control you.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 16 I say, live by the Spirit and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
\v 17 For the flesh lusts against the Spirit and the Spirit works against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other with the result that you do not do the things you desire to do.
\v 18 But if the Spirit is leading you, you are not under the law.
