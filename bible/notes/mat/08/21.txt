===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to explain what is expected of his followers.

  * **allow me first to go and bury my father ** - "May I firgo home and take care of my father until he dies" or "May I go home and take care of my father's funeral." After he had done that, he would follow Jesus.
  * **Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead** - Jesus was saying the man should follow him now and leave those who are spiritually dead to take care of their dead relatives. (See: [[en:ta:translate:Idiom]])
