\v 27 About noontime, Elijah started to make fun of them. He said, "\add Surely\add* Baal is a god, so it seems that you must shout louder! Perhaps he is thinking about something, or perhaps he has gone to the toilet. Or perhaps he is traveling to somewhere, or perhaps he is asleep and you need to wake him up!"
\v 28 So they shouted louder. Then, doing one of the things that they frequently did \add when they worshiped Baal\add*, they slashed\f + \ft Or: cut \f* themselves with knives and swords until a lot of blood flowed.
\v 29 They continued calling out to Baal all afternoon. But there was no voice that gave a reply, no answer, no god who paid attention.

\v 27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he is musing, or he is
gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleepeth and must be awaked.
\v 28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them.
\v 29 And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the
evening oblation; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
