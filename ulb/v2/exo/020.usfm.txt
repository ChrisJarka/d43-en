\c 20
\p
\v 1 And God spoke all these words, saying,
\v 2 I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
\v 3 You shall have no other gods before me.
\p
\v 4 You shall not make to you a graven image, nor any likeness
of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
\v 5 You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them, for I Jehovah your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity
of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me,
\v 6 and showing lovingkindness to thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
\p
\v 7 You shall not take the name of Jehovah your God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in
vain.
\p
\v 8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
\v 9 Six days shall you labor, and do all your work;
\v 10 but the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah your God: in it
you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your man-servant, nor your maid-servant, nor your cattle,
nor your stranger that is within your gates:
\v 11 for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore
Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
\p
\v 12 Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which Jehovah your God gives thee.
\p
\v 13 You shall not kill.
\p
\v 14 You shall not commit adultery.
\p
\v 15 You shall not steal.
\p
\v 16 You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
\p
\v 17 You shall not covet your neighbor’s house, you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his
maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is your neighbor’s.
\p
\v 18 And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking:
and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off.
\v 19 And they said to Moses, Speak you with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
\v 20 And Moses said to the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that you sin
not.
\v 21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
\p
\v 22 And Jehovah said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, You yourselves have seen that I have talked
with you from heaven.
\v 23 You shall not make other gods with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, you shall not make to you.
\v 24 An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt-offerings, and your peace-offerings, your
sheep, and your oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you.
\v 25 And if you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stones; for if you lift up your tool upon it, you
have polluted it.
\v 26 Neither shall you go up by steps to mine altar, that your nakedness be not uncovered thereon.
