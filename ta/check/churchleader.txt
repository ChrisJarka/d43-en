===== Church Leader Check =====

After the translation has been checked by community members for clarity, it will be checked by a group of church leaders for accuracy. This group must consist of at least three church leaders who are native speakers of the target language, and at least one of which understands well one of the languages in which the source text is available. They should not be related to, or otherwise closely connected with, the translator (or translation team). Usually these reviewers will be pastors of church congregations. These church leaders should represent the different churches in the language community. That is, they must not be from the same church network, but must be from three different church networks, if the community has that many. These reviewers should follow these steps:

  - Read the [[:en:statement-of-faith|Statement of Faith ]]and [[:en:translation-guidelines|Translation Guidelines ]]to make sure that the translation is in agreement with both of those as they review the translation.
  - Answer the questions about the translator or translation team that are located [[:en:ta:check:translatorqualifications|here]].
  - Verify that the translation communicates clearly and naturally by following the guidelines [[:en:ta:check:clear|here]].
  - Verify that the translation accurately communicates the meaning of the source text by following the guidelines __[[:en:ta:check:accurate|here]]__. 
  -
  -Is the translation missing any of its parts? In other words, does the translation include all the events of the book that was translated?[[:en:ta:check:3|[3]]]

  -Is the translation appropriate[[https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/checking/level2/appropriate|?]]

  -Are the words used [[https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/checking/level2/acceptable|acceptable? ]]

  -If there is a problem in the translation in any of the areas mentioned in sections 3 or 4, make a note of that.

  -After you have reviewed several chapters, or a whole book of the Bible if it is short, meet with the translation team and ask about each problem.

  -Discuss with the translation team how they might adjust the translation in order to fix the problems.

  -Verify that the translation team has fixed the problems.

  -Affirm on Door43:

  -That the translation conforms to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines.

  -That the translation is accurate and clear in the target language.

  -That the community approves of the translation.

[[:en:ta:check:3|[3]]] Sometimes there are differences in verse numbering between translations, or sometimes certain verses are put in footnotes. Ask the following questions to see how the translator handled these situations:

  - Does the translation include all the verses of the book that was translated? (When you look at the verse numbering of the national language translation, are all of the verses included in the target language translation?)
  - Are there places in the translation where something seems to be left out, or there seems to be a different message than is found in the national language translation? (The wording and the order can be different, but the language that the translator used should give the same message as the national language translation.)

[[:en:ta:check:4|[4]]] These are questions that will help determine whether or not the translation has been done in a style that is acceptable to the intended audience:

  - Is the translation written in a way that can be understood easily by both young and old members of the language community? (Whenever someone speaks, they can change their choice of words for either a younger or an older audience. Is this translation done using words that suit a wide variety of people?)
  - Is the style of this translation more formal or informal? (Is the manner of speaking appropriate for the local community?)

[[:en:ta:check:5|[5]]] These questions will help to determine if an appropriate alphabet has been chosen to represent the sounds of the language and words have been written in a consistent way so that the translation will be easy to read:

  - Is the alphabet suitable to represent the sounds of the language of the new translation? (Are there any sounds that make a difference in meaning but have to use the same symbol as another sound? Does this make the words hard to read? Can additional marks be used to adjust these letters and show the differences?)
  - Is the spelling used in the book consistent? (Are there rules that the writer should follow to show how words change in different situations? Can they be described so others will know how to read and write the language easily?)
  - Did the writer use an appropriate form of the language acceptable to the wider language community? (Is the writer familiar with the dialects of your language found throughout the area? Has the writer used expressions, phrases, connectors, and spellings that will be recognized by a broad section of the language community?)
