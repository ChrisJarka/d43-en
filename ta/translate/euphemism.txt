====== Euphemism ======

A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant, embarrassing or considered to be socially unacceptable. Its purpose is to avoid offending the people who hear or read it.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * Use the euphemism that is used in the original if people would understand it.
  * Use a euphemism from your own culture.
  * State the information plainly without a euphemism if it would not be offensive.

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**When a woman in the city who was __a sinner__, learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.** Luke 7:37\\
Since all people are sinners, the word __sinner__ here did not mean simply that this woman was a sinner but that she was a prostitute.

**He came to the sheep pens by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to __cover his feet__.** 1 Samuel 24:3\\
"Cover his feet" is a euphemism for "defecate." English uses the euphemism "relieve himself." Sometimes people don't like to speak directly of things coming from the body.

===== Examples from English =====

**Adult beverages** => refers to “beer or liquor.”\\ 
**He passed away** and **He departed** => mean “He died.”\\ 
**He slept with her** => usually means “They had sexual relations with each other.”\\ 
**Bathroom** and **restroom** => refer to a room that has a toilet in it.
