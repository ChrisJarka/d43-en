\v 13 Birds settled\f + \ft Or: went to live \f* on the fallen tree, and wild animals lived among its branches.
\v 14 The result of what I have done is that no other trees, even if they have plenty of water, will ever grow very high and become proud, and lift their tops above the branches of other trees. I do not want any other tree to grow high like that cedar tree did; trees will all certainly die and decay in the ground, like people die and go down to their graves.

\q
\v 13 All the birds of the heavens rested on its trunk, 
\q and all the living beasts of the field sat on its branches.
\v 14 This happened so that none of the other watered trees would ever grow that tall, so that they would not raise their tree tops above the foliage, for no other tree that drank up water would never again grow that tall. For they were all handed over to death down to the lowest part of the earth, in the midst of the people of mankind who go down to the pit."

===== Translation Notes: =====

The parable about the cedar continues.

  * **All the birds of the heavens** – "All the birds that fly in the sky"
  * **rested on its trunk** – This can be translated as "lived on the remains of the cedar" or "lived on the dead wood from the cedar that was laying on the ground"
  * **trunk** - The trunk is a very thick part of the tree that comes out of the ground and holds up the rest of the tree. 
  * **the living beasts of the field ** - "the wild animals lived in the branches of the cedar"
  * **watered trees** - "trees that get a lot of water"
  * **would not raise their tree tops above the foliage** – Possible meanings are 1) "would not grow taller than the branches of other trees" or 2) "would not put their tops in the clouds."
  * **for no other tree that drank up water would never again grow that tall** - This can be translated as "and no other trees that gets a lot of water will ever grow that tall again."
  * **For they were all handed over to death** - This can be translated as "For I gave all the trees over to death" or "For I made it so that all the trees will die." Yahweh is speaking. (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
  * **down to the lowest part of the earth** - The words "they were all handed" are left out of this phrase, but they are intended to be understood. Alternate translation: "and I made it so that all trees will go deep under the ground." When trees die, they usually end up buried in the ground. So, saying that "all the trees will go deep under the ground" means that "all trees will die." (See: [[en:ta:translate:ellipsis]])
  * **in the midst of the people of mankind** - This can be translated as "I made is so that they would be with the descendants of Adam" or "I made it so that they would be with the people in the ground." 
  * **who go down to the pit** - "who have died and gone into the ground"
  * **the pit** - "The pit" refers to the grave. It was where people were buried when they died.
