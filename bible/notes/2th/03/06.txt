\v 6 \add Our\add* fellow believers, we command you, with the authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* that our Lord Jesus Christ \add has given to us\add*, that you stop associating with every fellow believer who is lazy and refuses to work. That is, you must stay away from those who are not \add conducting their lives\add* in the manner that we taught you.
\v 7 \add We tell you this\add* because you yourselves know that you should \add behave\add* like we \add behaved\add*. We did not just sit \add around\add* without working\f + \ft Or: were never lazy \f* \add while we were living\add* among you.
\v 8 Specifically, we did not eat anyone's food if we did not pay \add that person\add* for it. Instead, we worked very hard \add to support ourselves\f + \ft Or: to earn the money to buy what we needed\add* \f*. We worked hard \f + \ft doublet \f* during the day and the night, in order that we would not have to depend on any of you \add to supply what we needed\add*.
\v 9 We have always had the right \add to depend on you for money, but instead we worked hard in order to make ourselves\add* examples for you, in order that you should behave like we behave.

\p
\v 6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us.
\v 7 For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
\v 8 neither did we eat bread for nothing at any manâ€™s hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you:
\v 9 not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an ensample to you, that you should imitate us.
