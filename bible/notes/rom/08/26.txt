\v 26 In the same way the Spirit also helps in our weakness. For we do not know how we ought to pray, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.
\v 27 and he that searcheth the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes in behalf of the saints according to the will of God.
