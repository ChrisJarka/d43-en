\v 9 So I tell you this: Keep asking God for what you need, and he will give it to you. Keep seeking his will and he will show it to you. Keep on praying urgently to God, like someone knocking on a door, and he will open the way for you to receive what you pray for.
\v 10 Remember that anyone who asks will receive and anyone who seeks will find, and anyone who knocks will have the door opened for him.
