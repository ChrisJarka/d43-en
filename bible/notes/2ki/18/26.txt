\v 26 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to your servants in the
Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not with us in the Jewsâ€™ language, in the ears of the people that are on the
wall.

has he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water
with you?
