\v 13 And a prophet wrote \add in\add* another \add Scripture passage what Christ said about God\add*,
\q I will trust him.
\p And in another \add Scripture passage, Christ said about those who are like his\add* children,
\q I and the ones that God has given me are here.


\p
\v 14 So, since those \add whom God calls his\add* children are all human beings \f + \ft metonymy \f*, Jesus also became a human being \add just like them\add*. The devil has the power to cause people \add to be afraid\add* to die, but Christ became human in order that by his dying he might make the devil powerless.
\v 15 \add Jesus did that\add* to free all of us who are like slaves \f + \ft metaphor \f* all the time we live, because we are \add forced to\add* be afraid to die.

\p
\v 13 And again, I will put my trust in him. And I wil say itl again, I and the children whom God has given me."
\v 14 Therefore since tChrist and the children of God are of the same flesh and blood, he   was able through his death and resurrection to put an end to him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.
\v 15 This was so he might deliver all those who lived in the bondage of fearing death.
