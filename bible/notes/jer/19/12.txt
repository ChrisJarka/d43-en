\v 13 The houses in Jerusalem and the palaces of the kings of Judah will be desecrated like this place will be.

\v 12 That is what I will do to this city and to you people who live here. I will make you unfit to worship me, and this city will be like you, just as Topheth is.
\v 13 The houses in Jerusalem and the palaces of the kings of Judah will be unfit, like this place will be. All the houses where you burned incense on the rooftops to honor the stars that you worshiped, and where you poured out wine to be an offering to your gods, will become unfit for anyone who worships me to live in.'"

<usfm>
\v 12 This is what I will do to this place and its inhabitants when I make this city like Topheth—this is Yahweh's declaration—
\v 13 so the houses of Jerusalem and of the kings of Judah will become like Topheth—all the houses on whose rooftops the unclean people worship all the stars of the heavens and pour out drink offerings to other gods.'"
