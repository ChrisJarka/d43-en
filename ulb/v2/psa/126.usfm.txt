\c 126
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q
\v 1 When Jehovah brought back those that returned to Zion,
\q We were like to them that dream.
\q
\v 2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
\q And our tongue with singing:
\q Then said they among the nations,
\q Jehovah has done great things for them.
\q
\v 3 Jehovah has done great things for us,
\q Whereof we are glad.
\q
\v 4 Turn again our captivity, O Jehovah,
\q As the streams in the South.
\q
\v 5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
\q
\v 6 He that goes forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing,
\q Shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with
him.
