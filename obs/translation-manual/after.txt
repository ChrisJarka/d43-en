===== What To Do when the Translation Is Completed =====

==== Put Your Work Online ====

When you are done with your translation, and even before you are done, we encourage you to put your work online at door43.org. If you can't upload it yourself, email it to [[info@distantshores.org]] and we will upload it for you. By uploading your work while the translation is in progress it allows others to see your work, become excited in it, participate in the translation and checking process, and benefit from hearing God's Word in their own language! Another added benefit of uploading a completed language which has been checked to at least a Level 1 is that the content is published on the unfoldingWord website which in turn populates the unfoldingWord mobile app. This greatly enhances the ease of distribution. In addition, the text will be rendered as a print-ready PDF which will allow for printing of hard-copy books as well. 

==== Distribute the Finished Product ====

Ultimately our goal should be to get the finished translation to the people who need it. This can be done by showing them the website, downloading the app, sharing the files by email, Bluetooth, etc, or by making printed copies of Open Bible Stories available. 

==== Record the Audio ====

Another great way to help people understand Open Bible Stories is to record someone reading a translation of Open Bible Stories that has been checked to Level 3. These recordings can be easily converted into videos. If you are interested in recording the Stories, please contact Brad at [[brad@distantshores.org]]. He will help you to do a high quality recording of these Stories. 

==== Make Videos ====

Once the audio recordings have been made, videos can be quickly made of each story. To see a sample, click [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCLd3ruQUwk|here]]. 

==== Begin Translating the Bible ====

Soon, the same tools and process will be able to be used for translating the Bible! This is not currently available, but is in active development. 

Thank you for being faithful to God's calling to help “make disciples of every nation”!
