\v 4 Like a woman who is unfaithful to her husband, you are being unfaithful to God and not obeying him anymore. Those who behave as evil people do belong to this world and are enemies against God. Perhaps you do not realize that.
\v 5 Surely you do not think that it is for no reason that God told us in the Scriptures that the human spirit that God placed in humans now deeply desires evil things, like envying and jealousy.

\v 4 You adulteresses! Don't you know that friendship with the world is hostility against God? Therefore, whoever decides to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
\v 5 Or do you think the scripture is useless when it says that the human spirit God placed in us is now filled with envy?
