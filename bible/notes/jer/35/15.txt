Stop worshiping other gods, in order that you will be able to live peacefully in this land that I gave to you and your ancestors.' But you would not pay attention to what I said or obey me.
\v 16 The descendants of Jehonadab have obeyed their ancestor, but you have refused to pay attention to what I told you.

\v 15 And I sent out all my servants, the prophets, to you being persistent to send them to say, “Let each man turn from his wicked way and make your deeds good and no 
longer walk after other gods to serve them, but return to the land that I gave to you and your fathers! Yet you will not extend your ears or listen to me.”
\v 16 For the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have maintained the commandments of their father that he commanded them, but this people will not listen to me!
