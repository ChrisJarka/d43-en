\v 1 At that time Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah; for he had heard
that Hezekiah had been sick and had recovered.
\v 2 Hezekiah was pleased by these things; he showed the messengers his storehouse of valuable things—the silver, the gold, the spices and precious oil, the storehouse of his weapons, and all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his kngdom, that Hezekiah did not show them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Hezekiah was pleased by these things**  - "Hezekiah welcomed the messengers with joy because of the letter and the gift the king had sent"
  * **showed the messengers his storehouse of valuable things** - "he showed the messengers everything of value he had kept"
  * **There was nothing in his house, nor in all his kingdom **- This statement is made of negative phrases to strengthen a positive meaning. This is also a Hyperbole. Hezekiah probably did not show them everything he owned. (See: Litotes and Hyperbole)
