\v 12 Then Balaam replied to Balak, "Did I not also speak to your messengers that you sent to me, saying, 
\v 13 'Even if Balak should give me his palace full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Yahweh, to do either good or bad or anything I might want to do. Only what Yahweh tells me to speak, that will I speak.'
\v 14 So now, look, I will go back to my people. But first let me warn you what this people will do to your people in the days ahead."
