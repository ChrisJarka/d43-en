\v 10 Do we not all have one father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously each against his brother,
profaning the covenant of our fathers?
\v 11 Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the
sanctuary of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
\v 12 May Yahweh will cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant of the man that does this, and
him that offers an offering to Yahweh of armies.
