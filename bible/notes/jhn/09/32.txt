\v 32 No one has ever enabled a man to see who was blind when he was born \add like I was\add*. That has never happened since the world began!
\v 33 So if this man had not come from God, he would not be able to do anything \add like that\add*!"
\v 34 They replied to him, "You were born \add as a result of your parents'\add* sin \f + \ft euphemism \f*\f + \ft Or: bastard \f*! Do you think you are qualified to teach us?\f + \ft Or: You are not qualified to teach us! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" Then they threw him out \add of the synagogue\add*.

\v 32 Not since the beginning of the world has it been heard anywhere that anyone was able to open the eyes of a man who was blind from birth!
\v 33 If this man had not come from God, he could do nothing like that!"
\v 34 They replied to him, "You were born and and have lived your whole life entirely in sin! And you think you are qualified to teach us?" And they threw him out of the synagogue.
