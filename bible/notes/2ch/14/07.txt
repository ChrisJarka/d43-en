\v 7 For he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet
before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built
and prospered.
\v 8 And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare
shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.
