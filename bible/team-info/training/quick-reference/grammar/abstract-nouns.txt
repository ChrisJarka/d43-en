====== Abstract Nouns ======

===== Description =====

//**Nouns**// are by definition a person, place, thing or idea. **ABSTRACT NOUNS** are things that cannot be seen, heard, tasted, smelled or touched with our physical senses. Ideas and things like 'peace' are equally real, but can not be seen or touched.
