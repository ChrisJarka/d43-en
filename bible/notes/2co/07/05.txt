\v 5 Now I will write more about what I was saying about Titus. When I left Troas and came here to Macedonia province, I still did not get rest for my body. Everywhere we went, people were constantly causing us trouble. And not only were people constantly causing us trouble, but I was greatly concerned about you all.
\v 6 But God, who always encourages his people when they are discouraged, encouraged us by sending Titus back to us.
\v 7 I was encouraged byseeing Titus, but when I heard how you had encouraged him, that encouraged me even more. He told me how much you wanted to see me. He told me that you were very sorry that you had made me so unhappy. He also told me that you are very eager for me to continue to serve as your apostle. When Titus told me those things, I was very, very happy.

\v 5 For even when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were troubled in every way; outside were battles and inside were fears.
\v 6 But God, who encourages those who are discouraged, encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.
\v 7 and not only by his arrival, but also by the encouragement that he received from you, when he told us your longing, your mourning and your loyalty to me, making me even more joyful.
