====== English Sentence Structure ======

A **//sentence//** is a group of words that express a complete thought. They may:

   * State something (declarative) 'This is a fact.'
  * Ask something (interrogative) 'Do you know him?'
  * Exclaim something (exclamatory) 'Ouch, that hurt!'
  * Order action (command) 'Pick that up.'

The //**subject**// is who or what the sentence is about; Subjects are typically nouns or pronouns. Sometimes a subject is not stated but is implied. For example, 'Close the door.' The verb is 'close'; the subject is implied to be 'you.' See [[en:ta:vocabulary:implicitexplicit]] for more information.
