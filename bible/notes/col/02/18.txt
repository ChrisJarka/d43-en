<usfm>
\v 18 Let no one disqualify you from the race by a false humility and by worship of angels. Such a person sees things and becomes conceited without cause by his fleshly thinking.
\v 19 He does not hold on to Christ, the head, from whom the whole body is supplied and held together through joints and ligaments, and the body grows as God provides the growth.
