\v 4 And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands
fulfilled it, saying,
\v 5 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to
build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:
