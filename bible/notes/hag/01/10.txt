====== Haggai 01:10-11 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 10 It is because of what you \add are doing\add* that rain does not fall from the sky, and as a result there are no crops.
\v 11 I have caused a drought\f + \ft Or: severe lack of rain \f* on the hills and on your fields. The result has been that your grain \add has withered\add*, and your grapevines \f + \ft metonymy \f* and olive trees \f + \ft metonymy \f* and all your other crops have dried up. \add Because of that\add*, you and your cattle \add do not have enough food\add*, and the hard work that you have done will be for nothing."

<usfm>
\v 10 It is because of what you are doing that rain does not fall from the sky, and as a result there are no crops.
\v 11 I have caused a drought over both fields and mountains and all your other crops—whether grain or wine or oil—have dried up. Because of that, you and your cattle do not have enough food, and the hard work that you have done will be for nothing.'"

<usfm>
\q
\v 10 Because of this the heavens withhold the dew from you, and the earth withholds its produce.
\q
\v 11 I have summoned a drought upon the land and upon the mountains, upon the grain
\q and upon the new wine, upon the oil and upon the harvest of the earth,
\q upon men and upon beasts, and upon all the labor of your hands!"

===== translationNotes: =====

  * **the heavens withhold the dew from you** - The dew that appears at night is spoken of as if it formed in the sky and fell like rain. The sky is spoken of as if it were a person who refused to give a present or a parent who refused to feed his child. AT: "the sky does not allow the dew to fall" or "no dew forms" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **I have summoned a drought upon the land** - Rain not falling for a long time is spoken of as if Yahweh had told a person to come and make the land dry. AT: "I have kept the rain from falling on the land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
  * **upon the new wine, upon the oil** - "Wine" and "oil" are metonyms for grapes and olives. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **all the labor of your hands** - The abstract noun "labor" can be translated using the phrase "work hard." The labor that the hands perform is a metonym for the things that the labor produces. The hand is a metonym for the person. AT: "everything you have worked hard to make" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_abstractnouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
