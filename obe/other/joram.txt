Joram was a king of Israel, the son of Ahab and Jezebel.

  * Joram was also known as Jehoram and reigned at the same time as a different Jehoram who was king of Judah.
  * Joram was a godless man who followed the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat, causing Israel to sin. [**also followed the ways of his evil parents] [**suggest keeping his name as Joram to distinguish from the king of Judah by the same name]
