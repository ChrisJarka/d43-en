\v 1 After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is
the sea of Tiberias.
\v 2 And a great multitude followed him, because they [*]saw the signs which he did on them that were sick.
\v 3 And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
\v 4 Now the passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.
\v 5 Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude comes to him, says to Philip, Whence are we
to buy bread, that these may eat?
\v 6 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
\v 7 Philip answered him, Two hundred shillings’ worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.
\v 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, says to him,
\v 9 There is a lad here, who has five barley loaves, and two fishes: but what are these among so many?
\v 10 Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five
thousand.
\v 11 Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down; likewise also of the
fishes as much as they would.
\v 12 And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be
lost.
\v 13 So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over
to them that had eaten.
\v 14 When therefore the people saw the sign which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that comes into the
world.
\p
\v 15 Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the
mountain himself alone.
\p
\v 16 And when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea;
\v 17 and they entered into a boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come
to them.
\v 18 And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew.
\v 19 When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing
near to the boat: and they were afraid.
\v 20 But he says to them, It is I; be not afraid.
\v 21 They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were
going.
\p
\v 22 On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save one, and
that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples went away alone
\v 23 (howbeit there came boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks):
\v 24 when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and
came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
\v 25 And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when came you hither?
\v 26 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of
the loaves, and were filled.
\v 27 Work not for the food which perisheth, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of man shall give
to you: for him the Father, even God, has sealed.
\v 28 They said therefore to him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God?
\v 29 Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent.
\v 30 They said therefore to him, What then do you for a sign, that we may see, and believe thee? what workest you?
\v 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.
\v 32 Jesus therefore said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven;
but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.
\v 33 For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.
\v 34 They said therefore to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
\v 35 Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall not hunger, and he that believes on me shall
never thirst.
\v 36 But I said to you, that you have seen me, and yout believe not.
\v 37 All that which the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.
\v 38 For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
\v 39 And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise
it up at the last day.
\v 40 For this is the will of my Father, that every one that sees the Son, and believes on him, should have eternal life;
and I will raise him up at the last day.
\p
\v 41 The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven.
\v 42 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how does he now say, I am come down
out of heaven?
\v 43 Jesus answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.
\v 44 No man can come to me, except the Father that sent me draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day.
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that has heard from the Father, and has
learned, comes to me.
\v 46 Not that any man has seen the Father, save he that is from God, he has seen the Father.
\v 47 Verily, verily, I say to you, He that believes has eternal life.
\v 48 I am the bread of life.
\v 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
\v 50 This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
\v 51 I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yes and the
bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.
\p
\v 52 The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
\v 53 Jesus therefore said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his
blood, you have not life in yourselves.
\v 54 He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
\v 55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
\v 56 He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.
\v 57 As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that eats me, he also shall live because of me.
\v 58 This is the bread which came down out of heaven: not as the fathers ate, and died; he that eats this bread shall live
for ever.
\v 59 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
\p
\v 60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?
\v 61 But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, Doth this cause you to stumble?
\v 62 What then if you should behold the Son of man ascending where he was before?
\v 63 It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and are
life.
\v 64 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who it
was that should betray him.
\v 65 And he said, For this cause have I said to you, that no man can come to me, except it be given to him of the
Father.
\p
\v 66 Upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
\v 67 Jesus said therefore to the twelve, Would you also go away?
\v 68 Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of eternal life.
\v 69 And we have believed and know that you are the Holy One of God.
\v 70 Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil?
\v 71 Now he spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he it was that should betray him,
being one of the twelve.
