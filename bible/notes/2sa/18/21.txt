\v 21 Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what you have seen. And the Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
\v 22 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite.
And Joab said, Wherefore will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the tidings?
\v 23 But come what may, said he, I will run. And he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain,
