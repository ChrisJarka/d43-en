\v 1 And the princes of the people lived in Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in
Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the other cities.
\v 2 And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 Now these are the chiefs of the province that lived in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah lived every one in his
possession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of
Solomon’s servants.
\v 4 And in Jerusalem lived certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah:
Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the
children of Perez;
\v 5 and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Colhozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of
Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite.

the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah.
\v 8 And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.

\v 11 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of

\v 14 and their brethren, mighty men of valor, a hundred twenty and eight; and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of

\p
\v 15 And of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
\v 16 and Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chiefs of the Levites, who had the oversight of the outward business of the house of
God;
\v 17 and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the chief to begin the thanksgiving in prayer,
and Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
\v 18 All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four.
\p
\v 19 Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, that kept watch at the gates, were a hundred seventy and two.
\v 20 And the residue of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.
\v 21 But the Nethinim lived in Ophel: and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim.
\p
\v 22 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the
son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business of the house of God.
\v 23 For there was a commandment from the king concerning them, and a settled provision for the singers, as every day
required.
\v 24 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king’s hand in all matters
concerning the people.
\p
\v 25 And as for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and the towns thereof,
and in Dibon and the towns thereof, and in Jekabzeel and the villages thereof,
\v 26 and in Jeshua, and in Moladah, and Beth-pelet,
\v 27 and in Hazar-shual, and in Beer-sheba and the towns thereof,
\v 28 and in Ziklag, and in Meconah and in the towns thereof,
\v 29 and in En-rimmon, and in Zorah, and in Jarmuth,
\v 30 Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and the fields thereof, Azekah and the towns thereof. So they encamped from
Beer-sheba to the valley of Hinnom.
\v 31 The children of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward, at Michmash and Aija, and at Beth-el and the
towns thereof,
\v 32 at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
\v 33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
\v 34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
\v 35 Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.
\v 36 And of the Levites, certain courses in Judah were joined
to Benjamin.
