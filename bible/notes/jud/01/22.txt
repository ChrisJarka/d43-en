===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 22 Be kind to those who are not certain about what teachings they should believe, and help them.
\v 23 Keep others from going into the fire of everlasting punishment. Be kind to people who sin, but be afraid to join them in those sins. Instead, hate even their clothing, because it is made dirty by their sins.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>

===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[en:obe:kt:mercy]]
  * [[en:obe:kt:save]]
  * [[en:obe:other:fire]]
  * [[en:obe:kt:fear]]
  * [[en:obe:kt:flesh]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **and save some people** - "present the truth about Christ to some people." The use of the word "some" reveals that they are to present to a few people, not to everyone. 
  * **snatching them out of the fire** - the act of leading someone to an understanding of Christ will save them from hell and its fire. 
  * **and on some have mercy with fear** - Be kind to people living in sin, being alert to the deceit and temptations that you will see so that you can deny them. 
  * **as you hate even the garment spotted by the flesh** - " Hate even their clothes, because they are made unclean by sin." "even the garment" represents everything about these sinful people, who are entirely unclean. (See [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:synecdoche]])
