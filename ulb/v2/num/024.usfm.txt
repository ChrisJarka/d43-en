\c 24

\v 1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet with
enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
\v 2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
\v 3 And he took up his parable, and said,
\q Balaam the son of Beor saith,
\q And the man whose eye was closed saith;
\q
\v 4 He saith, who hears the words of God,
\q Who sees the vision of the Almighty,
\q Falling down, and having his eyes open:
\q
\v 5 How goodly are your tents, O Jacob,
\q Your tabernacles, O Israel!
\q
\v 6 As valleys are they spread forth,
\q As gardens by the river-side,
\q As lign-aloes which Jehovah has planted,
\q As cedar-trees beside the waters.
\q
\v 7 Water shall flow from his buckets,
\q And his seed shall be in many waters,
\q And his king shall be higher than Agag,
\q And his kingdom shall be exalted.
\q
\v 8 God brings him forth out of Egypt;
\q He has as it were the strength of the wild-ox:
\q He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,
\q And shall break their bones in pieces,
\q And strike them through with his arrows.
\q
\v 9 He couched, he lay down as a lion,
\q And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?
\q Blessed be every one that blesses thee,
\q And cursed be every one that curses thee.
\p
\v 10 And Balakâ€™s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I called you
to curse mine enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.
\v 11 Therefore now flee you to your place: I yought to promote you to great honor; but, lo, Jehovah has kept you back
from honor.
\v 12 And Balaam said to Balak, Spake I not also to your messengers that you sent to me, saying,
\v 13 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either good or
bad of mine own mind; what Jehovah speaketh, that will I speak?
\v 14 And now, behold, I go to my people: come, and I will advertise you what this people shall do to your people
in the latter days.
\v 15 And he took up his parable, and said,
\q Balaam the son of Beor saith,
\q And the man whose eye was closed saith;
\q
\v 16 He saith, who hears the words of God,
\q And knows the knowledge of the Most High,
\q Who sees the vision of the Almighty,
\q Falling down, and having his eyes open:
\q
\v 17 I see him, but not now;
\q I behold him, but not nigh:
\q There shall come forth a star out of Jacob,
\q And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel,
\q And shall strike through the corners of Moab,
\q And break down all the sons of tumult.
\q
\v 18 And Edom shall be a possession,
\q Seir also shall be a possession, who were his enemies;
\q While Israel does valiantly.
\q
\v 19 And out of Jacob shall one have dominion,
\q And shall destroy the remnant from the city.
\m
\v 20 And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,
\q Amalek was the first of the nations;
\q But his latter end shall come to destruction.
\m
\v 21 And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,
\q Strong is your dwelling-place,
\q And your nest is set in the rock.
\q
\v 22 Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted,
\q Until Asshur shall carry you away captive.
\m
\v 23 And he took up his parable, and said,
\q Alas, who shall live when God does this?
\q
\v 24 But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim,
\q And they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber;
\q And he also shall come to destruction.
\m
\v 25 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
