===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Paul and Timothy **- "From Paul and Timothy." Your language may have a particular way of introducing the authors of a letter. This could be translated as "We, Paul and Timothy, wrote this letter."
  * **servants of Jesus Christ**  - The phrase “We are” is implied (See:</font> [[https://door43.org/en/ta/translate/implicitexplicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]]<font 14px line-height: 21.7777786254883px;/Lato, sans-serif;;rgb(51, 51, 51) font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21.7777786254883px;;;inherit>). You could make it clearer with a new sentence: “We are servants of Jesus Christ.”</font>
  * **to all the ones set apart in Christ Jesus**  - This letter is written to all the people who believe in Christ Jesus. When you believe in Jesus, you are then devoted or dedicated to God. The Bible calls this "set apart."
  * **the overseers and deacons**  - These words are used for the leaders of the church and those who have been chosen to help them.
  * **Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. - **  This is a typical greeting Paul included at the beginning of each of his letters to the churches.
  * **you**  - <font 14px line-height: 21.7777786254883px;/Lato, sans-serif;;rgb(51, 51, 51) font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21.7777786254883px;;;inherit>The pronoun “you” refers to the believers in the Philippian Church.
