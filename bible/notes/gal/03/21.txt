\v 21 If someone should ask, "When God gave his laws to Moses long after he told Abraham what he was promising to give to him, was he changing his mind?" I would reply that God certainly did not change his mind when he did that! If God had given a law that could enable people to live eternally, then it actually would be because of people obeying that law that God would erase the record of their sins.
\v 22 But instead, what we read in the Scriptures is that God caused all people to be unable to escape being punished for their sins, just like people in prison are unable to escape. God did that in order that he might give what he promised to those who trust Jesus Christ, just because they trust him.

\v 21 Then is the law against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, certainly righteousness would have come by the law.
\v 22 But instead scripture imprisoned everyone under sin. So God's promise of saving us by faith in Jesus Christ was given to those who believe.
