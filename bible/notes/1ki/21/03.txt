\v 3 And Naboth said to Ahab, Jehovah forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee.
\v 4 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for
he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face,
and would eat no bread.
