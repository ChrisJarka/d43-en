====== Verbs ======

Verbs either link the subject to a descriptive portion of the sentence or express an action or a state-of-being (e.g. am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been).\\
Many languages use more verbs than English does. Events are usually expressed by **VERBS**.\\
The context of the sentence determines the type of verb because some can function in different ways. For example, "The fish tasted oily," uses tasted as a linking verb that describes the subject. "John tasted the fish," uses tasted as an action verb showing what John did.

Some verbs require a 'helper' and thus become a verb phrase. Examples include: am eating, are running, have been eating, will be eating.

The portion of the sentence which contains the verb is called the predicate.

==== VERB TENSE ====

Just as time has past, present and future, verbs do also. The verb reflects when the action takes place. Perfect tenses of verbs indicate continuing action (either continuous from a time past or continuous into the future).

==== VERBS AND OBJECTS ====

Simple sentences have a SUBJECT (PARTICIPANT), VERB (EVENT), and OBJECT (PARTICIPANT). English grammar allows for not stating the object of the verb. Examples:

  * 'You have **grown**  since I last saw you.' the object is not stated while in the sentence 'You have **grown**  a //beard//  since I last saw you.' states the object of "beard."
  * 'He has been **singing**  all day.' the object is not stated while 'He has been **singing**//hymns//  all day.' states the object of "singing."

Your language may require to have an object for every verb.

==== SINGULAR & PLURAL SUBJECTS â€“ VERB AGREEMENT ====

Nouns and Pronouns have the ability to be either singular (meaning one) or plural (more than one). For the majority of words, plurals are formed simply by adding an 's' to the root word. Some words

The [[:en:ta:vocabulary:singularpronoun|Singular Pronouns]] & [[:en:ta:vocabulary:pluralpronouns|Plural Pronouns]] pages have more information. Basically, singular pronouns include I, he, she and it. Plural pronouns include you, they and we. "It" refers back to nouns (the antecedent) which are non-human. There are collective nouns which describe quantities in excess of one but which remain singular in treatment; for example, team refers to several people. However, in a sentence, team is singular. (e.g. The team is tired.)

Verb agreement requires matching singular subjects with singular verbs. For example:

  * 'The boys eat lunch next door.' The word "boys" is plural and "eat" is plural.
  * 'The boy eats alone.' One boy (singular) uses a singular verb (eats).

Most of the time:

  * Nouns that are plural have an 's' on the end; verbs that are plural do not.
  * Singular verbs typically have an 's' on the end and their subject will not (e.g. A dog eats. Two dogs eat.)

Pronouns work the same way; it is important to use the right verb for each of the pronouns. The chart below shows the "Be" verb (in present and past tense) with each of the pronouns; the first four are singular in form and the remaining ones are plural.

|**Pronoun**   |**Present**   |**Past**   |
|I |am |was |
|he |is |was |
|she |is |was |
|it |is |was |
|you |are |were |
|they |are |were |
|we |are |were |

==== SOME ENGLISH VERB ODDITIES ====

**Can and May**. The verb "can" shows ability or power; "may" involves permission. Examples:

  * 'I can read' states a fact.
  * 'May I read now?' seeks permission to do something I have the ability to do.

**Teach and Learn**. These verbs are partners. Teaching imparts knowledge. Learning means getting knowledge.

**Sit, Sat and Set**. These verbs are often confused. "Sit" is used to convey resting or being seated. "Set" means to place something. "Sat" is the past tense for sit. "Set" stays the same in both present and past tense. Examples:

  * 'I sit on a chair.' means 'I rest on a chair.'
  * 'I set my book on the table.' means 'I place my book on the table.'
