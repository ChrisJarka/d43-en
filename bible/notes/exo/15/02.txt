===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Yahweh is my strength and song** - The words here "strength" and "song" are used to compare God to a warrior and the reason for singing. AT: "Yahweh is my warrior and the reason why I sing." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **warrior** - God powerfully fights our enemies and is victorious.
