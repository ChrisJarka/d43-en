===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Then a sword will come against Egypt** - The word "sword" here refers to "war" or "an attack." Alternate translation: "Then Egypt will experience war" or "Egypt will be attacked." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]])
  * **there will be anguish in Cush** – "Cush will be very sad" or "the people of Cush will be full of grief"
  * **when the slain fall in Egypt** - Possible meanings are 1) "when Egyptians die in the war" or 2) "because Egyptians die in the war." The people of Cush will be full of grief when they find out that so many of the Egyptians died in the war.
  * **And they take her wealth** – "The attackers will take away the wealth of Egypt" or "The enemy army will take the riches of Egypt"
  * **her foundations are ruined**- This phrase compares the destruction of Egypt with the destruction of a building. The foundation is the most important part of a building. If the foundation of a building is destroyed, the whole building will fall. So, when Ezekiel says that the foundations of Egypt are ruined, he means that Egypt is completely destroyed. Alternate translation, "Egypt is completely destroyed." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
  * **Put** - This is the name of the people who descended from Put, who was the third son of Ham. They lived near the Egyptians in the land that is now called Libya.
  * **Lud** - This is probably the name of a people who were descendants of Mizraim, who was a son of Ham. They probably lived in Libya near the people of Put.
  * **all the mixed people** - These are probably foreigners who lived in Egypt. They did not belong to a particular people group, but were the descendants of many different people groups. Alternate translation: "all of the foreigners in Egypt."
  * **Cub** - We do not know who these people were, but they wereprobably a people group that lived near Egypt and had an agreement with Egypt.
  * **the sons of the land of their covenant** – Possible meanings are 1) "everyone else who lived in the lands of Egypt's allies" or 2) "all of the Jews living in the land of Egypt." It is unclear from the context whether "the covenant" refers to an agreement that Egypt made with other people groups or whether "the covenant" refers to the agreement Yahweh made with the Israelites.
  * **will fall by the sword** – "will die in battle" or "will die in the war"
