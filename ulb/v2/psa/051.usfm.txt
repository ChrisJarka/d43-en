\c 51
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David; when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.
\q
\v 1 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to your lovingkindness:
\q According to the multitude of your tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
\q
\v 2 Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity,
\q And cleanse me from my sin.
\q
\v 3 For I know my transgressions;
\q And my sin is ever before me.
\q
\v 4 Against you, you only, have I sinned,
\q And done that which is evil in your sight;
\q That you may be justified when you speakest,
\q And be clear when you judgest.
\q
\v 5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity;
\q And in sin did my mother conceive me.
\q
\v 6 Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts;
\q And in the hidden part you will make me to know wisdom.
\q
\v 7 Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean:
\q Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
\q
\v 8 Make me to hear joy and gladness,
\q That the bones which you have broken may rejoice.
\q
\v 9 Hide your face from my sins,
\q And blot out all mine iniquities.
\q
\v 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God;
\q And renew a right spirit within me.
\q
\v 11 Cast me not away from your presence;
\q And take not your holy Spirit from me.
\q
\v 12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation;
\q And uphold me with a willing spirit.
\q
\v 13 Then will I teach transgressors your ways;
\q And sinners shall be converted to thee.
\q
\v 14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, you God of my salvation;
\q And my tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.
\q
\v 15 O Lord, open you my lips;
\q And my mouth shall show forth your praise.
\q
\v 16 For you delightest not in sacrifice; else would I give it:
\q You have no pleasure in burnt-offering.
\q
\v 17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit:
\q A broken and a contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
\b
\q
\v 18 Do good in your good pleasure to Zion:
\q Build you the walls of Jerusalem.
\q
\v 19 Then will you delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
\q In burnt offering and whole burnt offering:
\q Then will they offer bullocks upon your altar.
