\v 27 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that
was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
\v 28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Your father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man
that eats food this day. And the people were faint.
