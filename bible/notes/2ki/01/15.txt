\v 15 So the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, "Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him." So Elijah arose and went down with him to the king.
\v 16 Later Elijah said to Ahaziah, "This is what Yahweh says, 'You have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron. Is it because there is no God in Israel from whom to inquire of his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will certainly die."
