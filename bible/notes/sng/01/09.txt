  * **General Information:** - The woman's lover continues speaking to her.

  * **I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariot horses** - The Jews of those days considered horses beautiful, and the Pharaoh's horses would have been the most beautiful he could find. The lover considers the young woman beautiful. AT: "My love, you are as beautiful as any of Pharaoh's chariot horses" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **my love** - "you whom I love"
  * **Pharaoh's chariot horses** - "the horses that pull Pharaoh's chariots"
  * **Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments** - These ornaments could be 1) jewels hanging from a band around the head or 2) earrings or 3) a metaphor for her long hair. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **We will make** - The man speaks as if he were many people. Some versions change this to singular "I." Other versions take these to be the words of the woman's friends. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pronouns]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
  * **with silver studs** - "with spots of silver"
