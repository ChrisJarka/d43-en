\v 1 \add Now there are\add* other things \add that I want to write about\add*. My fellow believers, continue to rejoice because \add you belong to\add* the Lord. \add Though\add* I will \add now\add* write to you about those same matters \add that I mentioned to you before, this is\add* not tiresome for me, and it will protect you \add from those who would harm you spiritually\add*.


\p
\v 2 Beware of those \add people who are dangerous\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like wild\add* dogs. They are \add dangerous\add* evildoers \f + \ft doublet \f*. Beware of them \add since they are like people who\add* cut \add other people's\add* bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add They will harm you spiritually by insisting that you must let someone circumcise you in order for you to become God's people\add* \f + \ft metonymy, metaphor \f*.
\v 3 \add Those people think that they are God's people because someone has circumcised them\add*. But we, \add not they\add*, are \add truly God's people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add whether or not someone has\add* circumcised \add us\add*. God's Spirit \add enables us to\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* worship \add God\add*; we praise Christ Jesus \add because he has enabled us to become the people of God\add*. We do not believe \add that God will consider\f + \ft Or: make \f* us his people as a result of what someone has done to our\add* bodies \f + \ft metonymy, synecdoche \f*.

\v 1 Finally, my fellow believers, continue to rejoice because you belong to the Lord. Though I will now write to you about those same matters that I mentioned to you before, this does not make me tired, and it will protect you from those who would like to harm you.


\p
\v 2 Beware of those people who are as dangerous to you as wild dogs. They just mutilate mens' bodies so they will become Jews.
\v 3 But as for us--the Spirit of God enables us to truly worship God; he honors us because we trust in Christ Jesus; and the rituals or ceremonies that people perform mean nothing to us. There we ourselves are what it truly means to be circumcized.

\p
\v 1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.  For me to write these things to you is not a problem, and they will keep you safe.
\v 2 Watch out for the dogs. Watch out for the evil workers. Watch out for the mutilators.
\v 3 For we are the true circumcision, we who worship in the Spirit of God, glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
