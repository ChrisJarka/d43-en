\v 4 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he prophesieth;
neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:
\v 5 but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondman from my youth.
\v 6 And one shall say to him, What are these wounds between your arms? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.
