\v 21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
\v 22 and if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.
\v 23 But if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
