\v 6 After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also
four heads; and dominion was given to it.
\v 7 After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it
had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the
beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
