===== Description =====

Apostrophe is a figure of speech in which someone speaks to someone or something that is not there. This calls attention to his feelings toward that person or thing. He could even speak to a thing or idea as if it were a person (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]). 

**Reason this is a translation issue** \\ 
Many languages do not use apostrophe, and readers could be confused by it.\\ 

===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Come now, you who are rich, cry out loud because of the miseries coming upon you.** (James 5:1)\\ 
James wrote to the church, which was made up of poor people, as if rich people could hear him, showing his anger about what rich people were doing. 

**The man of God cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh and said, "Altar, altar, Yahweh says, ' ...  on you they will burn men's bones.' "** (1 Kings 13:2) \\
The man of God spoke as if the altar could hear him, but he really wanted the king, who was standing there, to hear him.

===== Translation Strategies =====
If apostrophe would not be  strategies are for if your language cannot use x.

  - You may put the name of the one being spoken to first, to show that the speaker has drawn his attention away from his primary audience to another audience.
  - Some languages have a marker that shows that someone is being spoken to. For example, English speakers used to use "O" before saying the name of the one they were talking to as in "O Moab" and "O forest."
  - If this way of speaking would be confusing to your people, you may preserve the meaning of the apostrophe and let the speaker continue speaking to his audience. See the example of 1 Cor 15:55 in the UDB, below.

**__O death__, where is your victory? __O death__, where is your sting?"**  1 Corinthians 15:55 (ULB) \\

"Death will never win again! The pain of dying has been taken away!"
