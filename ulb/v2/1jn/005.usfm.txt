\c 5
\p
\v 1 Whosoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God: and whoever loves him that became the father of loves him also that
is begotten of him.
\v 2 Hereby we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commandments.
\v 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
\v 4 For whatever is begotten of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that has overcome the world,
even our faith.
\v 5 And who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
\v 6 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with
the blood.
\v 7 And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.
\v 8 For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one.
\v 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for the witness of God is this, that he has borne
witness concerning his Son.
\v 10 He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in him: he that believes not God has made him a liar; because he
has not believed in the witness that God has borne concerning his Son.
\v 11 And the witness is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
\v 12 He that has the Son has the life; he that has not the Son of God has not the life.

\v 13 These things have I written to you, that you may know that you have eternal life,
even to you that believe on the name of the Son of God.
\v 14 And this is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us:
\v 15 and if we know that he hears us whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
\v 16 If any man see his brother sinning a sin not to death, he shall ask, and
God will give him life for them that sin not to death. There is a sin to death: not concerning this do I say that
he should make request.
\v 17 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not to death.
\p
\v 18 We know that whoever is begotten of God sins not; but he that was begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one
touches him not.
\v 19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the evil one.
\v 20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him that is true, and we are in
him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
\v 21 My little children, guard yourselves from idols.
