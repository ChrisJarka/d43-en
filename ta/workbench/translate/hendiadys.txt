Hendiadys is when a speaker makes a single idea more forceful by connecting two nouns or adjectives with “and” when one of the words actually describes the other.
===== Description =====

Hendiadys is when a speaker expresses a single idea by connecting two words with “and” when one of the words actually describes the other.

**his own __kingdom and glory__** (1 Thessalonians 2:12)\\
Though "kingdom" and "glory" are both nouns, "glory" actually tells what kind of "kingdom" it is: it is a kingdom of glory or a glorious kingdom.

**Reasons this is a translation issue**\\
  * Often hendiadys has an abstract noun. Some languages may not have a noun with the same meaning.
  * Some languages do not use hendiadys, so people may not understand that one word describes the other. 


===== Examples from the Bible =====

**in truth and love** (2 John 1:3 ULB)\\
This is hendiadys because "truth" describes what God and Jesus are, but "love" tells what they do.

**if you are willing and obedient** (Isaiah 1:19 ULB)\\
This is hendiadys because "willing" speaks of a person's desires, while "obedient" speaks of a person's actions.

===== Translation Strategies =====

If leaving the hendiadys in would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider doing so. If not, here are other options:

  - Substitute the noun that describes the other noun with an adjective that means the same thing.
  - Substitute the adjectives with a an adverb and a verb that mean the same thing. 
  - Change nouns and adjectives to sentences.
