\c 7
\p
\v 1 Judge not, that you be not judged.
\v 2 For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you.
\v 3 And why behold you the mote that is in your brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in your own eye?
\v 4 Or how will you say to your brother, Let me cast out the mote out of your eye; and lo, the beam is in your own eye?
\v 5 You hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of your own eye; and then shall you see clearly to cast out the mote out of
your brother’s eye.
\p
\v 6 Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine, lest haply they trample them under
their feet, and turn and rend you.
\p
\v 7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you:
\v 8 for every one that asks receiveth; and he that seeks findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
\v 9 Or what man is there of you, who, if his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone;
\v 10 or if he shall ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?
\v 11 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven
give good things to them that ask him?
\v 12 All things therefore whatever you would that men should do to you, even so do you also to them: for this is the law
and the prophets.
\p
\v 13 Enter you in by the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction, and many are
they that enter in thereby.
\v 14 For narrow is the gate, and straitened the way, that leads to life, and few are they that find it.
\p
\v 15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.
\v 16 By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
\v 17 Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.
\v 18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
\v 19 Every tree that brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
\v 20 Therefore by their fruits you shall know them.
\v 21 Not every one that says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my
Father who is in heaven.
\v 22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by your name, and by your name cast out demons, and by your
name do many mighty works?
\v 23 And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.
\p
\v 24 Every one therefore that hears these words of mine, and does them, shall be likened to a wise man, who built his
house upon the rock:
\v 25 and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was
founded upon the rock.
\v 26 And every one that hears these words of mine, and does them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his
house upon the sand:
\v 27 and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and struck upon that house; and it fell: and great was
the fall thereof.
\p
\v 28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:
\v 29 for he taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.
