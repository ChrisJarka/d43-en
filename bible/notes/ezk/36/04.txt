\v 4 Therefore, mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord Yahweh: Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and the high hills, to the streambeds and valleys, to the uninhabited desolations and the forsaken cities that have become plunder and a subject of mocking for to the other nations that surround them—
\v 5 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: I have certainly spoken in the fire of my fury against the other nations, against Edom and all who took my land for themselves as a possession, against all those who had joy in their heart and disdain in their spirit, as they seized my land for the sake of its pasture.
\v 6 Therefore, prophesy to the land of Israel and say to the mountains and to the high hills, to the streambeds and to the valleys, thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold! In my fury and in my anger I am declaring this because you have born the insults of nations.
