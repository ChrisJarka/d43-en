===== How to Translate Unknowns =====

This module answers the question: How do I translate words that I do not know?\\
There are times that the source language will use words and ideas that are not familiar. If you do not know what the source word means, the Translation Notes and Important Terms pages will help you understand its meaning. Sometimes, however, a word in the source text is an object, animal, practice, or other thing that is not known to the people who speak the target language. The following information will help with translating these unknown things or concepts. 

==== Historical facts ====
It is very important to remember that if the term expresses a historical fact, then that fact must be kept in a translation. For example, in Mark 11:13, Jesus cursed a fig tree. To substitute any other kind of tree would be untrue to a historical fact. To translate this in a language that has no word for "fig," follow one of the following options: 
 * Use a general descriptive phrase, such as “a fruit tree.”
 * Use a descriptive phrase with a borrowed word, such as “a tree that bears fruit called 'figs.'”
 * Use a borrowed word for the name of the tree: “a fig tree.”
For the last two choices, a footnote would be necessary to explain what “fig” means. 
The first time you identify something, you might use a descriptive phrase. The next time you refer to it, you might be able to shorten the expression, so that you won't have long descriptive phrases every time. 
Another example is In John 12:14-15 where it says that Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey's colt, which fulfilled a prophecy in the the Old Testament. Since it says that Jesus was sitting on a donkey's colt, which is a young donkey, the translation should not say that he sat on an ox, for example. If the word for “donkey” does not exist in the target language, a borrowed word could be used and explained in the text or in a footnote. For example, the text could say, “riding on the young of a kind of work animal called a ‘donkey.'” This is different from the use of an animal as part of a teaching or illustration. In that case, it is not a matter of historical fact. See the example of “wolf” below. 

==== Illustrations ====
Some of the things in the Bible that might be unknown in your culture are part of an illustration or teaching example rather than part of a historical account. In this case, you may make substitutions that serve the same purpose of illustration. One example of this is in John 10:12 where the word “wolf” is used as a way to describe a person who is harmful to God's people. There are many things to describe about a wolf but what is important in this verse is that it is a fierce and dangerous animal that frightens and harms the sheep. 
If a wolf is an unknown animal in your culture, you could substitute an animal that looks similar and that has similar characteristics. For example, large wild dogs are similar to wolves. They attack and eat other animals, such as lambs. So “wolves” could be translated with a generic term like “wild dogs” or “fierce dogs” or with the name of a specific animal like a dog that your people know of, such as “coyotes” or “jackals.” You could also use a general descriptive phrase such as, “a dangerous wild animal” that focuses on the characteristics that are being highlighted in the text. 
Also see the Translation Note at Luke 10:3 for other translation suggestions for "wolf." See also the Translation Note at Luke 9:62 for suggestions for translating "plow."

==== Cultural practices ====
There might be many differences between the biblical culture and the target language culture. Sometimes a cultural substitute can be used. But be careful not to change any historical facts (see explanation above). 
The unknown biblical practice could be explained in a footnote or Bible teaching. The explanations could include a known cultural practice that has the same meaning as the one described in the Bible text. For example, in Jewish culture, grief and repentance for sin were shown by wearing a rough type of cloth (sackcloth) and putting ashes on the head. Wailing was another sign of grief. In other cultures grief may be shown in different ways. But if this practice is part of an account that actually happened, then it needs to be recorded as such, with an explanation that tells what it means, perhaps using a practice from the target culture that has the same meaning. 
For example, in certain cultures when men greeted other men who were family or friends, they would kiss them on one cheek or both cheeks. This can be translated as “to greet him with a kiss” or “to greet him by kissing him.” If this is not done in your culture, you could explain it with a footnote. If your readers would find it embarrassing or inappropriate to say that a man would kiss another man, you could translate it in a more general way such as, “to give him a friendly greeting.” 
See the example of 'greet with a kiss' in Luke 22:47. 

==== Translation Suggestions ====
Here are suggestions to keep in mind when translating a term that is not familiar in your language: 
 * Use a descriptive phrase. You will most likely need to use a phrase to explain the meaning of the unknown word. It is important only to describe the part of the meaning which is being used in the particular verse being translated.
 * Substitute something similar. At times the exact word may be unknown to the people of the target language but there might be something similar that could be used in its place. Only do this if the term does not express a historical fact.
 * Use a foreign word from another language. Foreign words are words taken from a language that is not the target language. You could also use the foreign word together with a general word or descriptive phrase.
 * Use a word that is more general in meaning. An example would be “work animal” which is more general than the word “donkey.” This is acceptable because a donkey is a kind of work animal.
 * Use a word or phrase that is more specific in meaning. Sometimes there is no general word in the target language to describe the term, therefore you can give specific examples of the term being referred to. An example would be if there is no word for “lights” to refer to heavenly bodies, you could possibly say, “the sun, the moon, and the stars,” using specific words.

==== Things to keep in mind when borrowing words from other languages ====
There are times that the language of wider communication may have words that your language does not have. Sometimes your language may not have a word for a certain person, place, or thing that is in the source text, and you have decided to borrow the word from the source language rather than use a substitution or description. The words in the Bible that you will copy or borrow most are the proper names of people, places and things. \\

There are several things to be aware of when borrowing words from one language into another. You may need to make adjustments to the word that you borrow so that the people that speak the target language can read and pronounce it easily.

  * Different languages use different scripts, such as the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Cyrillic, Devenagari, and Korean scripts. These scripts use different shapes to represent the letters in their alphabets.
  * Changing a word from one script to another is called "transliterating" it. To do this, simply write the word by substituting each letter shape with the corresponding letter shape that makes the same sound, or the closest sound, in the script of your language.
  * Languages that use the same script might pronounce the letters in that script differently. For example, when speaking German, people pronounce the letter “j” the same way that people pronounce the letter “y” when speaking English. In this case, you may want to adjust the spelling so that the word sounds the same in both languages.  
  * Languages do not all have the same sounds or combinations of sounds. For example, many languages do not have the soft “th” sound in the English word “think.” Instead of using "th" for such a language, you might need to choose a letter that represents a different but similar sound. 
  * You may need to modify the spelling of a borrowed word to fit the spelling conventions of your language. For example if Greek uses “gg” to represent the “ng” sound you might change the spelling to “ng.” As another example, for a language that never ends a word with “d,” you might spell the name “David” as “Davit.”
