\v 3 Furthermore, when I was with you, I felt that I was not adequate  \add to do what Christ wanted me to do\add*. I was afraid  \add that I would not be able to do it\add*, and because of that I was trembling very much.
\v 4 When I taught you and preached to you, I did not speak words that  \add unbelievers would consider\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise in order to convince them that my message was true. Instead, \add God's\add* Spirit showed that it was true by  \add enabling me to\add* powerfully  \add perform miracles\add*.
\v 5  \add I taught and preached that way\add* in order that you might believe  \add my message\add*, not because you heard words that people  \add considered to be\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise, but  \add because you realized\add* God's power.

\v 3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
\v 4 And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
\v 5 So that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
