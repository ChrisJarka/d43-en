\v 27 Then all the king's officials crowded around them. They saw that the flames had not harmed them. The flames had not even singed any of the hair on their heads or scorched any of their clothes! There was not even any smell of smoke on them!

\v 26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego, you servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out
of the midst of the fire.
\v 27 And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the kingâ€™s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men,
that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had
the smell of fire passed on them.
