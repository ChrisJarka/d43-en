<usfm> \v 12 They will take away all the people's valuable possessions and steal the things that the merchants sell. They will tear down the walls of the houses and destroy their fine houses. Then they will throw into the sea the stones from the walls of those houses and the timber and the rubble. \v 13 No longer will you sing noisy songs, and people will not play their harps anymore. \v 14 They will cause the city to become a bare rock and only a place where men spread their fishing nets. And the city will never be rebuilt. Those things will surely happen because I, Yahweh the Lord, have declared that they will happen. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 12 So they will plunder your strength and despoil your merchandise! And they will tear down your walls and your opulent houses until your stone and wood and dust are laid in the midst of the waters. \v 13 For I will stop the noise of your songs and the sound of your lyres will no longer be heard! \v 14 For I will make you a bare cliffside; you will become a place for nets to dry out. You will no longer be built up, for I, Yahweh, have declared it!’—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration! </usfm>
