===== Translation Notes: =====

    * (Zechariah continues prophesying to his newborn son.)
    * **because of the tender mercy of our God**  - Another way to translate this phrase would be, "because God is compassionate and merciful to us."
    * **of our God** - This could also be translated as, "that God has shown us." Note that throughout these verses "our" and "us" are inclusive. (See [[en:ta:vocabulary:inclusive|Inclusive]].)
    * **like the rising sun** - This can also be translated as  "like the sunrise" or "like the dawn." (See [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:simile|Simile]].)
    * **He will shine upon** - This is a metaphor meaning "He will give knowledge to." This could also be translated as "He will give spiritual light to." (See [[en:ta:figuresofspeech:metaphor|metaphor]]).
    * **people who sit in darkness** - This is a metaphor meaning "people who do not know the truth". This could also be translated as "people who live in spiritual darkness."
    * **and (who sit in) the shadow of death** - This is a metaphor meaning "who are about to die" or "and who are afraid that they will soon die."
    * **guide** - This is a metaphor for "teach".
    * **our feet**  - This is a synecdoche and refers to the whole person, not just the feet. It could also be translated as "us." (See [[en:ta:figures of speech:synecdoche:Syncdoche]].)
    * **into the path of peace** - This is a metaphor meaning "into a peaceful life" or "a life at peace with God." That is, "to walk along a path that leads to peace" or "to live in a way that brings peace with God." Make sure your translation of this fits with how you translate "our feet."
