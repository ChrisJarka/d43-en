\q
\v 5 Behold, as wild asses in the desert
\q They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food;
\q The wilderness yieldeth them bread for their children.
\q
\v 6 They cut their provender in the field;
\q And they glean the vintage of the wicked.
\q
\v 7 They lie all night naked without clothing,
\q And have no covering in the cold.
