===== translationNotes: =====

  * **for the band of men ... had killed all his older sons** - This is background information about the events of [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:21:16|21:16-17]]. Ahaziah was called "Jehoahaz" in that earlier account. It is possible he changed his name when he became king. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
  * **all his older sons** - "all Jehoram's older sons"
  * **Athaliah** - This is the name of Ahaziah's mother. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **He also walked in the ways** - Here "walked in the ways" is an idiom that means he followed Ahab's example. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:20:31|20:32]]. AT: "He also followed the example" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **the house of Ahab** - The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to the descendants of Ahab. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:2ch:21:06|21:6]]. AT: "the descendants of Ahab" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
