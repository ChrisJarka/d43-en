====== Proverbs 06 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Chapter 3 continues a collection of proverbs that ends in chapter nine. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Parallelism ==

Proverbs are often written without any surrounding context and in two lines of text. Each line will have a certain relationship to the other line. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Many of the proverbs are stated as promises or commands but they are intended to be advice. 

== My Son ==

Occasionally the author addresses a proverb to "my son'. This is not intended to restrict the words of that proverb to only males but is still given in the context of a father warning his son. 

== Animals Used as Types ==

The gazelle and the ant have certain characteristics which author uses to give wisdom. If your language does not recognize these characteristics in those animals you could add a footnote to explain or possibly substitute another animal from your culture that would help explain the same concept. 

== Numbers ==

Occasionally the author will mention a list of 6 things or 7 things, that Yahweh hates, these numbers are used to drawn attention to the list of things. It is not important whether it is 6 or 7 in the list. 

== Rhetorical Questions ==

The author will use rhetorical questions to draw the reader's attention to important points. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
