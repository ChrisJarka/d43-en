\v 1 Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into
the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
\v 2 and he came even before the king’s gate: for none might enter within the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.
\v 3 And in every province, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews,
and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
