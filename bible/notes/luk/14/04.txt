====== Luke 14:4-6 ======

\v 4 \add They knew that their laws permitted it, but they thought that healing was work, which they thought was wrong to do\add* on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f* (OR\add , they knew that their laws permitted it, but they did not want to admit it\add*). So they did not reply. Then Jesus put his hands on the man and healed him. Then he told him to go \add home\add*.
\v 5 Then he said to the rest of them, "If you had a son or an ox that fell into a well on a Sabbath\f + \ft Or: our day of rest \f*, would you immediately \add work to\add* pull him out, \add or would you\f + \ft singular \f* let him stay there until the next day\add*?"
\v 6 \add They knew that they would immediately work to pull him out, even on their day of rest, so they could not justly say that Jesus did wrong by healing the man on that day. So\add* they said nothing to reply to Jesus.
