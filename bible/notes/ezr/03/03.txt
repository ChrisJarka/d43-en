\v 3 And they set the altar upon its base; for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries: and they offered
burnt offerings thereon to Jehovah, even burnt offerings morning and evening.
\v 4 And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the decree, as the duty of every day required;
\v 5 and afterward the continual burnt-offering, and the offerings
of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a
free will offering to Jehovah.
