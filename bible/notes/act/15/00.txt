====== Acts 15 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 15:16-18, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

The events of this chapter are commonly called the "Jerusalem Council." This was a time when many church leaders got together to discuss the relationship between the Gentiles and the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|Law of Moses]]. The council affirmed that Gentiles did not need to follow the Mosaic Law. In fact, no one within the church should follow this law. 

=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Brothers ==
Brothers is now being used to reference fellow Christians instead of fellow Jews. 

== "You cannot be saved" ==
This is obviously a false idea. Even during the Old Testament times, a person was [[:en:obe:kt:save|saved]] by their [[:en:obe:kt:faith|faith]] and not by their obedience to the [[:en:obe:kt:lawofmoses|law of Moses]]. Paul and Barnabas went to Jerusalem to discuss this issue so that church could have unity.

== "Turn away from things sacrificed to idols, blood, things strangled, and from sexual immorality" ==
It is possible that these actions were necessary for harmony between the Jews and Gentiles.
