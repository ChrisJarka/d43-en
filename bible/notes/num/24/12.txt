\v 12 And Balaam said to Balak, Spake I not also to your messengers that you sent to me, saying,
\v 13 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either good or
bad of mine own mind; what Jehovah speaketh, that will I speak?
\v 14 And now, behold, I go to my people: come, and I will advertise you what this people shall do to your people
in the latter days.
