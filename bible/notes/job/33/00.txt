====== Job 33 General Notes ======


=== Structure and formatting ===

Instead of being punished for his sins, Elihu challenges Job by saying that he was sinning in the midst of these difficulties. This is the first of Elihu's four statements. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:sin]] and  [[:en:obe:kt:witness]])


Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. This quotation is a continuation of the previous next chapter.
