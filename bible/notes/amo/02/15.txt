===== translationNotes: =====

  * **Connecting Statement:** - Yahweh continues his message of judgment on the people of Israel.

  * **The archer will not stand** - Here "stand" means to keep one's place in battle.
  * **the fast runner will not escape** - The implied information is that the fast runner will not escape from his enemies. AT: "the fast runner will be captured" See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **save himself** - "save his own life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
  * **flee naked** - Possible meanings are 1) this is a metonym for "run away without his weapons" or 2) this is meant literally as "run away wearing no clothes" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **in that day** - "at that time"
  * **this is Yahweh's declaration** - Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:02:11|2:11]]. AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
