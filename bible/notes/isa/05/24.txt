\v 24 Therefore as the tongue of fire devours stubble, and as the dry grass goes down in flame,

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **as the tongue of fire devours stubble, and as the dry grass goes down in flame** - These phrases mean basically the same thing. Isaiah is comparing God's punishment of his people to a fire that completely and easily burns up dead grass.  Alternate translation: "like a fire burns up dry grass" (See: [[en:ta:translate:doublet]] and [[en:ta:translate:simile]])
  * **their root will rot, and their blossom will blow away like dust** - Isaiah compares the people of God to a dying plant. Alternate translation: "they will die like a plant whose roots have rotted and blossom has blown away in the wind" (See: [[:en:ta:translate:metaphor]])
