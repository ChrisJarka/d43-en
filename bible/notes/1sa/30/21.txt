\p
\v 21 And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to
abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came
near to the people, he saluted them.
\v 22 Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with
us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that he may
lead them away, and depart.
