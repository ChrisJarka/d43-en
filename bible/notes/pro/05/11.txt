\q
\v 11 And you mourn at your latter end,
\q When your flesh and your body are consumed,
\q
\v 12 And say, How have I hated instruction,
\q And my heart despised reproof;
\q
\v 13 Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,
\q Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
\q
\v 14 I was well-nigh in all evil
\q In the midst of the assembly and congregation.
\b
