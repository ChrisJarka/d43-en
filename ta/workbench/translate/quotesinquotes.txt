SUMMARY: Multiple quotations embedded within each other demand that correct, clear punctuation aid the reader in understanding the meaning, which may be complicated. ​
===== Description =====

There are many examples in the Bible of a quotation occurring inside another quotation—even up to four layers. Translating these demands that you use correct, clear punctuation to aid the reader in understanding the meaning of the text, which, obviously, may be complicated. If quotes are not marked clearly in a translation, it can be hard for readers to know who is saying what.


===== Examples from the Bible =====

**Examples of two-layered quotations**

In these examples, the opening quote uses double quote marks and the embedded quote is surrounded by single quote marks. See at the end of the sentence that the single quote mark is followed by the double. And the question mark or period sits inside them both.

John 5:12 ULB:

**They asked him, “Who is the man that said to you, ** **‘****Pick up your bed and walk’?” **

Luke 19:29-31 ULB:

**… he sent two of the disciples, saying, “Go into the next village. As you enter, you will find a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me. If any one asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say, ‘The Lord has need of it.****’****”**

**Example**** of a three-layered quotation** in Genesis 20:10-13 ULB. If there are three layers, the third quote level will use double quotes :

**Abimelech said to Abraham, “What prompted you to do this thing?” Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. When God caused me to leave my father’s house and travel from place to place, I said to her, ‘You must show me this faithfulness as my wife: At every place where we go, say about me, “He is my brother.” ’ ” **

**Example of a four-layered quotation ** in 2 Kings 1:5-6 ULB:

**When the messengers returned to Ahaziah, he said to them, “Why have you returned?” They said to him, “A man came to meet us who said to us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, “Yahweh says this: ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die.’ ” ’ ”**

==== Translation Strategies ====

In some languages it would sound strange and perhaps even be confusing it there hare many levels of embedded direct quotes. Some use only direct quotes and others use only indirect ones. Here are ways to indicate quotes within quotes:

  - Use double quote marks and single quote marks for direct quotations within quotations as shown in the examples above.
  - Translate one or some of the quotes as indirect quotes. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
  - If a quotation is very long and has many quotations within it, do not use quote marks on the main, overall quotation. Instead indent it, and use quote marks only for the quotations within it.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1) Use double quote marks and single quote marks for direct quotations within quotations as shown in the examples above.

  * **Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.’ ”**  (Exodus 16:11-12 ULB)

    * Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.’ ”

2) Translate one or some of the quotes as indirect quotes. The indirect quotes do not have quote marks around them. We have underlined words that show the changes in the pronouns and verbs because of the indirect quotes.

  * **Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.’ ” **  (Exodus 16:11-12 ULB)
    * Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them __that__ at twilight __they__ will eat meat, and in the morning __they__ will be filled with bread. Then __they__ will know that I am the Lord __their__ God.”

  * **They said to him, "A man came to meet us who said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, "Yahweh says this: 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die.' " ' " **  (2 Kings 1:6 ULB) 
    * They told to him __that__ a man came to meet __them__  who said to __them__, “Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, ‘Yahweh says this: “Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die." ’ "

3) If a quotation is very long and has many quotations within it, do not use quote marks on the main, overall quotation. Instead indent it, and use quote marks only for the quotations within it.
  * **They said to him, "A man came to meet us who said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, "Yahweh says this: 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die.' " ' " **  (2 Kings 1:6 ULB) 

They said to him,
> A man came to meet us who said to us, "Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, 'Yahweh says this: "Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up; instead, you will certainly die." ' "
