====== Edit the ULB ======


**Introduction to the ULB** \\ 
The ULB (UnfoldingWord Literal Bible) is a relatively “literal” version that is intended to be used as a source text for translating the Bible into other languages. It is more literal than the UDB text in style and is designed to reflect the form of the original Greek text as well as clearly convey the meaning of that text. At times this will mean that the sentence structure or vocabulary may be less than completely natural in English, but the meaning should always remain very clear. Whenever a “literal” representation of the Greek words or structure would obscure the meaning, then it must be changed. Even in the ULB, meaning takes precedence over “literalness.”


The ULB and UDB texts are not intended to be “finished” or “polished” translations. Rather, they are meant only to serve as source texts for other translations. With this in mind, the primary aim of both these source texts is to accurately convey the meaning of the Bible text in a way that is easy to understand, even for people whose first language is not English. The ULB is more literal, staying closer to the structure of the original text and is more limiting in its use of implied information. The UDB, while still retaining the clear meaning of the original Greek text, allows more flexibility in sentence structure and vocabulary in order to achieve a highly natural way of expressing that meaning.


**The Text from which the ULB Is Being Adapted** \\ 
The ULB is an adaptation of the 1901 American Standard Version (ASV). The ASV is a very literal translation, and it has many outdated words. Most of these words are being replaced in the UDB with present-day vocabulary using automatic scripting on the server. The editing team needs to correct any outdated words that remain (as well as any mistakes made by the automated “correction” process), so that the text will be understandable to a modern audience. The editors will also change phrases and the order of phrases of the ASV that are unnatural in modern English, making it easier to understand while still keeping it close to the meaning and structure of the Greek text.


**Style of the ULB** \\ 
The ULB will remain fairly literal in style. As much as possible, complex theological terms and other translation issues will be explained in the translation notes that are provided along with the ULB texts. In addition, the ULB will be accompanied by the UDB, which will show alternate ways of expressing the meaning in a more natural way. The translation notes will also offer alternative translation suggestions. Links to explanations for important terms that are repeated throughout the Bible will be provided along with the ULB text. Therefore, it is acceptable for the ULB to retain some of the ASV's literalism, as long as the result makes sense in modern English.


=== Editing the ULB ===


The edit team members will:


    * Remove archaic language and replace with modern, clear English.
    * Make sure the text accurately expresses the meaning of the Greek text.
    * Check that the English level is easy to understand.
    * Retain the basically literal nature of the text–it should complement the "dynamic" UDB rather than be similar to it.


Specific editing guidelines:


    * Only use quotation marks at the beginning and ending of direct speech. Do not put quotation marks at the beginning of each verse, even though the speech may span several verses.
    * All pronouns are lower case (except when beginning sentences).
    * Capitalize titles (Son of Man, King David, the Messiah).
    * Try to find other ways to translate the Greek participle. Many languages do not have participles.


Translation Choices:


    * Use "It came about" rather than "It came to pass."
    * For "lawyers" use "experts in the Jewish law." Keep "scribes."
    * We will retain the word "behold" when used in narration, but use something more contemporary when used in direct speech, such as "look" or "listen."
    * For "Jehovah," use "Yahweh."


**Notes regarding drafting ULB and UDB texts:** 


1. The system we are using to draft these texts involves editors being able to edit the texts simultaneously. That means that what one editor deleted or added may be changed by another editor. However all the previous edits are preserved and can be viewed by using the timeline. The final editor will make decisions regarding what edits will be used for the final draft. Discussion about the edits or about alternate suggestions for the final editor to consider can be made in the chat boxes.


2. Although we are drafting these source texts in English, they will also be translated into other major languages (such as Spanish, French and others) to serve as source texts for people who know those languages and who will use these texts to translate into their own languages. Therefore the source texts have to be fairly easy to understand in order to be translated into the major languages, which in turn will need to be in a form that is easy to understand. Having them in natural English will set an example of naturalness that these other major languages can follow.


3. Translating from one language to another will involve changes in structure and differences in vocabulary. For example, one word in the first language may require two or more in the second language. The opposite will also be true, where the first language uses several words but the second language has to say it using only one word. Sometimes it is more natural in a language to omit a word like “is” (ex. Greek or Indonesian) whereas another language requires it (ex. English or French). The meaning is exactly the same but the way of expressing that meaning will be different depending on the language.


4. Strict adherence to certain words or structures at the expense of meaning results in a “translation” that does not preserve the meaning of the original text. So as these texts are drafted, we need to keep in mind that our aim is to faithfully communicate the meaning of the Greek text. A translation that does not make sense in the second language is not being faithful to the original text (which was written for the purpose of communicating a message). A stilted, unnatural translation obscures meaning, which is the opposite of what a translation should do.


5. Words will not always be translated exactly the same way every time they occur in the text since in every language, some words will have more than one meaning. One example in Greek is the word that can mean either “sky” or “heaven” depending on the context. In French the word for “dear” can also mean “expensive.” The word “run” in English can have many different meanings. There are many more examples like these in other languages. In these cases, the meaning of the word is usually made clear by the other words and sentences surrounding it.


6. The goal of both the ULB and UDB texts is to accurately communicate the meaning of the Greek text. The ULB will also strive to keep as closely as possible to the Greek words and language structures as long as doing so does not change the meaning or make it hard to understand. The UDB will allow more flexibility so as to produce an even more natural English text that communicates the same meaning in a more dynamic way.


**Draft of a sample portion of**  **ULB text** 


Types of edits to look for:


• awkward phrasing \\ • outdated or low frequency vocabulary (and outdated spellings) \\ • wrong punctuation \\ • extraneous implied information \\ • unclear or unnatural use of pronouns or conjunctions \\ • wording that could cause a translation issue \\ • implied information that is important for comprehension \\ • original information lost


**ULB Luke 12:1-3** 


Original:


v. 1 In the meantime, when the many thousands of the multitude were gathered together, insomuch that they trod one upon another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, Beware you of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.


v. 2 But there is nothing covered up, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.


v. 3 Wherefore whatever you have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and what you have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.


Edited:


v. 1 Meanwhile, while many thousands of people were crowding together so much that they were stepping on each other, Jesus began to say to his disciples first of all, “Be on guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy .”


v. 2 But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known.


v. 3 Therefore, whatever you say in the darkness will be heard in the light and whatever you have spoken in someone’s ear in a closet will be proclaimed from the roof of a house.
