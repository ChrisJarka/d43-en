\v 5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of
Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.
\v 6 And they came there into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the
body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
\v 7 Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they struck him, and killed him, and beheaded him,
and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.
