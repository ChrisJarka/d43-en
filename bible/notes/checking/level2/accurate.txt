====== **Accurate Text**  ======
When listening to the message of the translation and following the message in the national translation, ask the following questions to see if the translator made an accurate translation:

Q? Was everything mentioned in the new translation also mentioned in the flow of the national language translation?  (Did the meaning of the new translation follow the message (not necessarily the wording) of the national translation?)

Q? Were the people introduced in each story doing the same things as those mentioned in the national translation?  (Was it easy to see who was doing the events in the new translation when it was compared to the national language translation?)

Q? Are there Key Terms (important words) used in the translation that do not match your understanding of the words in the national translation?  (How do your people talk about a priest (one who sacrifices to God) or the temple (the sacrifice place of the Jews) without using a word borrowed from the national language?)

Q? Are the phrases of the new translation helpful in understanding the more difficult words of the national translation?  (Does the new translation brings better understanding and still fit with the meaning of the national language translation?)

Added help:

One way to determine if the text is accurate is to ask comprehension questions, such as “who, what, when, where, how and why”.
