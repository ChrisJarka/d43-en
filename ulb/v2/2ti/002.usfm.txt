\v 1 You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
\v 2 And the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit you to faithful men, who shall be able
to teach others also.
\v 3 Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
\v 4 No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this
life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.
\v 5 And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully.
\v 6 The husbandman that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.
\v 7 Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give you understanding in all things.
\v 8 Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:
\v 9 wherein I suffer hardship to bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.
\v 10 Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with
eternal glory.
\v 11 Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:
\v 12 if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:
\v 13 if we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he cannot deny himself.
\p
\v 14 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about
words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.
\v 15 Give diligence to present yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, handling aright the word
of truth.
\v 16 But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,
\v 17 and their word will eat as does a gangrene: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
\v 18 men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.
\v 19 Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his: and, Let every one
that names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.
\v 20 Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to
honor, and some to dishonor.
\v 21 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, meet for the master’s use,
prepared to every good work.
\v 22 But flee youthful lusts, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a
pure heart.
\v 23 But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.
\v 24 And the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,
\v 25 in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if perhaps God may give them repentance to the knowledge of
the truth,
\v 26 and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to his will.
