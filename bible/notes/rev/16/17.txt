\v 17 Then the seventh angel poured out into the air the wine that was in his bowl. As a result, someone said with a loud voice from the throne in the Most Holy Place, "The time for God to punish rebellious people is finished."
\v 18 When the angel emptied his bowl, lightning flashed, there were rumblings and thunder, and the earth shook. It shook more violently than it had ever shaken since people first lived on earth.
\v 19 And as a result, the very large city split into three parts. God also destroyed cities in other nations. God did not forget that the people of Babylon had sinned very much. So he made them drink a cup of the wine that made them suffer because he was angry with them.

\v 17 The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a great voice came out of the Holy of Holies and from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
\v 18 There were lightning bolts, voices, and peals of thunder. A great earthquake came about which has not come about since people have been on earth, so great an earthquake it was, so mighty.
\v 19 The great city divided into three parts, the cities of the nations fell, and Babylon the great was remembered in the presence of God. He gave her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
