\c 116
\q
\v 1 I love Jehovah, because he hears
\q My voice and my supplications.
\q
\v 2 Because he has inclined his ear to me,
\q Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
\q
\v 3 The cords of death compassed me,
\q And the pains of Sheol got hold upon me:
\q I found trouble and sorrow.
\q
\v 4 Then called I upon the name of Jehovah:
\q O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
\q
\v 5 Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous;
\q Yea, our God is merciful.
\q
\v 6 Jehovah preserves the simple:
\q I was brought low, and he saved me.
\q
\v 7 Return to your rest, O my soul;
\q For Jehovah has dealt bountifully with thee.
\q
\v 8 For you have delivered my soul from death,
\q Mine eyes from tears,
\q And my feet from falling.
\q
\v 9 I will walk before Jehovah
\q In the land of the living.
\q
\v 10 I believe, for I will speak:
\q I was greatly afflicted:
\q
\v 11 I said in my haste,
\q All men are liars.
\q
\v 12 What shall I render to Jehovah
\q For all his benefits toward me?
\q
\v 13 I will take the cup of salvation,
\q And call upon the name of Jehovah.
\q
\v 14 I will pay my vows to Jehovah,
\q Yea, in the presence of all his people.
\q
\v 15 Precious in the sight of Jehovah
\q Is the death of his saints.
\q
\v 16 O Jehovah, truly I am your servant:
\q I am your servant, the son of your handmaid;
\q You have loosed my bonds.
\q
\v 17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
\q And will call upon the name of Jehovah.
\q
\v 18 I will pay my vows to Jehovah,
\q Yea, in the presence of all his people,
\q
\v 19 In the courts of Jehovahâ€™s house,
\q In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
\q Praise you Jehovah.
