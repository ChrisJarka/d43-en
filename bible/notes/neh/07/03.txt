\v 3 And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand
on guard, let them shut the doors, and bar you them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in
his watch, and every one to be over against his house.
\v 4 Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.
