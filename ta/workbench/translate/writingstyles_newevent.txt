===== Description =====

A new event happens when a new time, of place or people or main purpose of telling the idea come into a story. The new information needs to be mentioned at the beginning of the new event. Most languages have definite ways and definite orders in which new information is told. 

**It happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth... to John** (Luke 3:9)- In this sentence a new event, the time, main character and place are all included.\\ 

This page will help you think through how you need to introduce this information in your language. You may need to change how and in what order new information is introduced at the beginning of a new event in order for your translation to sound natural in your language.

===== Examples from the Bible =====
**Now there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish Council. This man came to Jesus at night time** (John 3:1,2)\\
**I, John, ... was on the island called Patmos...on the Lord's day.** (Revelation 1:9)

===== Translation Strategies =====
  - Consider how people tell about happenings they have seen or done; and follow how they have introduced new people, places, times and purposes in their stories.
  - Where the this information is not known, consider using an indefinite word or phrase such as: another time, someone,
  - If your language introduces new people as the subject of the sentence reorder your sentence to make the new person the subject.
  - If the new person cannot be the subject of the sentence, consider using a dummy word as the subject.
