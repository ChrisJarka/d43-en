\v 12 At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had
heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
\v 13 And Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the
spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his
house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
