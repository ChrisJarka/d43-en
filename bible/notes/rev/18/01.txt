<usfm> \v 1 After this I saw another angel, one who had great authority, coming down from heaven. The earth became bright because he was shining so intensely. \v 2 He shouted with a very loud voice, "God is about to completely destroy the very evil city of Babylon. As a result, all kinds of evil spirits will live there, and all kinds of foul and detestable birds will live there. Babylon is like a prostitute \v 3 with whom all the people groups have committed acts of sexual immorality. God is very angry with them. Yes, and the kings of the earth have done the same things with her. The world's merchants became rich because she wanted to commit so much sexual immorality."
