Here is a great place to put in ideas for icons.


Add an icon - state the purpose - discuss. :)


How about a icon for the following:


Translation Hints:  An Icon of a candle {{en:ta:resource:tanslationhints.svg?nolink&100x100}}


Well Done: An Icon of a thumbs up


Test Yourself: An Icon of a check mark


Pause and Think: An Icon of an hourglass


I created rough and ready icons so what do people think?
