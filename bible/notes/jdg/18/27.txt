\v 27 The men of the tribe of Dan were carrying the things that had been made for Micah, and they also took his priest, and they continued traveling to Laish. They attacked the people who were peacefully living there, and killed them with their swords, and then they burned everything in the city.
\v 28 There was no group of people to rescue the people of Laish. Laish was far from Sidon \add city, so the people who lived there could not help the people of Laish\add*. And the people of Laish had no other allies. Laish was in a valley near Beth-Rehob \add town\add*.
\p The people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the city and started to live there.
\v 29 They gave to the city a \add new\add* name, Dan, \add in honor of\add* their ancestor Dan, who was one of the sons of Jacob.

\v 27 And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure,
and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.
\v 28 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the
valley that lies by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and lived therein.
\v 29 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: howbeit the name
of the city was Laish at the first.
