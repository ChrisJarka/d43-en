====== Jeremiah 29 General Notes ======



=== Special concepts in this chapter ===

== Two letters ==

Jeremiah sent a letter to Babylon telling the exiles to prepare for a long stay. A false prophet in Babylon wrote back to the chief priest telling him he should punish Jeremiah for sending his letter. Even though Jeremiah had prophesied the exile, the Jews still did not believe him. (See: [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]] and [[:en:obe:kt:prophet]])
