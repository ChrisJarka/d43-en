\v 5  Now I will say this to you young men  and women. Just like married men and women are to be subject to their spouses, you must be subject to the older men of the congregation. And all of you believers should act humbly toward each other, because this proverb is true,
\q God opposes people who are proud, 
but he acts kindly toward those who are humble.

\v 5 In the same way, you younger men, be subject to the older men. All of you gird yourselves with humility and serve one another. God resists the proud man, but he gives grace to the humble man.
\v 6 Therefore, humble yourselves under God's mighty hand so that he may exalt you in due time.
\v 7 Cast all your anxiety upon him, because he cares for you.
