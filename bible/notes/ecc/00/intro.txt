=== What is the Book of Ecclesiastes about? ===

Ecclesiastes is a group of short teachings that try to answer the question "What is life?" This book speaks about the futility of seeking a purpose in the things of this world. From the book's viewpoint, any work we perform or any knowledge and skill we gain are useless. Ecclesiastes is a series of thoughts about a variety of subjects, all of them about the purpose and worth of various actions and events.

=== How should the title of this book be translated? === 

The traditional title "Ecclesiastes" is another name for "assembly," but it carries little meaning as a title. Translators might consider creating a better title such as "Thoughts of a Teacher" or "Thoughts of a Wise Man."

=== Who wrote the Book of Ecclesiastes? ===

The author appears to be Solomon, who is called "the Teacher, the descendant of David and king in Jerusalem." The book appears to be written near the end of Solomon's reign as he reflects on how he wasted much of his life.

=== Why are there so many contradictions in the Book of Ecclesiastes? ===

Some people have viewed the author as a faithful man, while others see him as a tragic figure. The apparent contradictions in the book may be a reflection of Solomon's wavering faith, but it is also possible that the teachings in the book differ from each other in order to suit various circumstances in the reader's life.

===== Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts =====

=== What does the Book of Ecclesiastes teach about God's retribution? ===

In the Ancient Near East, people were concerned with the reason they were being punished or [[:en:obe:kt:bless|blessed]].  They often attributed these acts of [[:en:obe:kt:justice|justice]] or retribution to their [[:en:obe:kt:falsegod|gods]]. Ecclesiastes explains that Yahweh will bless the [[:en:obe:kt:righteous|righteous]] and punish the [[:en:obe:kt:evil]], but that he might not reward or punish a person until after the next life, after the person dies.

=== What value did the Israelites place on Ecclesiastes? ===

The Israelites have often questioned the value of this book, because of the book's unusual wording and theology. At times, the book appears to disagree with the rest of Scripture. While many people have questioned whether it should be part of the Bible, most people have affirmed it to be part of Scripture. This is because the book gives valuable lessons concerning the uselessness of living apart from Yahweh and of pursuing any goal other than his glory.

===== Part 3: Important Translation Issues =====

=== What is the meaning of the expression "under the sun" in the Book of Ecclesiastes? ===

"Under the sun" is another way of saying "on the earth" or "in this life." When the author says that there is "nothing new under the sun," this means that whatever happens on earth, it is always identical or similar to something that happened before.

=== How should one translate harsh or shocking passages? ===

There are parts of the book that can be shocking or surprising to read in the Book of Ecclesiastes. For example, "If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but if his heart is not satisfied with good and he is not buried with honor, then I say that a baby that is born dead is better off than he is" (6:3). The translator should allow these difficulties to remain and not try to "soften" them.
