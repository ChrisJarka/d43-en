\q
\v 1 Is there not a warfare to man upon earth?
\q And are not his days like the days of a hireling?
\q
\v 2 As a servant that earnestly desires the shadow,
\q And as a hireling that looks for his wages:
\q
\v 3 So am I made to possess months of misery,
\q And wearisome nights are appointed to me.
\q
\v 4 When I lie down, I say,
\q When shall I arise, and the night be gone?
\q And I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day.
\q
\v 5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;
\q My skin closeth up, and breaks out afresh.
\q
\v 6 My days are swifter than a weaverâ€™s shuttle,
\q And are spent without hope.
\q
\v 7 Oh remember that my life is a breath:
\q Mine eye shall no more see good.
\q
\v 8 The eye of him that sees me shall behold me no more;
\q Your eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.
\q
\v 9 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away,
\q So he that goes down to Sheol shall come up no more.
\q
\v 10 He shall return no more to his house,
\q Neither shall his place know him any more.
\b
\q
\v 11 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;
\q I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
\q I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
\q
\v 12 Am I a sea, or a sea-monster,
\q That you set a watch over me?
\q
\v 13 When I say, My bed shall comfort me,
\q My couch shall ease my complaint;
\q
\v 14 Then you scare me with dreams,
\q And terrifiest me through visions:
\q
\v 15 So that my soul chooses strangling,
\q And death rather than these my bones.
\q
\v 16 I loathe my life; I would not live alway:
\q Let me alone; for my days are vanity.
\q
\v 17 What is man, that you should magnify him,
\q And that you should set your mind upon him,
\q
\v 18 And that you should visit him every morning,
\q And try him every moment?
\q
\v 19 How long will you not look away from me,
\q Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
\q
\v 20 If I have sinned, what do I to thee, O you watcher of men?
\q Why have you set me as a mark for thee,
\q So that I am a burden to myself?
\q
\v 21 And why do you not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?
\q For now shall I lie down in the dust;
\q And you will seek me diligently, but I shall not be.
