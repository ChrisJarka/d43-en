\c 94

\q
\v 1 O Jehovah, you God to whom vengeance belongeth,
\q You God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.
\q
\v 2 Lift up thyself, you judge of the earth:
\q Render to the proud their desert.
\q
\v 3 Jehovah, how long shall the wicked,
\q How long shall the wicked triumph?
\q
\v 4 They prate, they speak arrogantly:
\q All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.
\q
\v 5 They break in pieces your people, O Jehovah,
\q And afflict your heritage.
\q
\v 6 They kill the widow and the sojourner,
\q And murder the fatherless.
\q
\v 7 And they say, Jehovah will not see,
\q Neither will the God of Jacob consider.
\q
\v 8 Consider, you brutish among the people;
\q And you fools, when will you be wise?
\q
\v 9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?
\q He that formed the eye, shall he not see?
\q
\v 10 He that chastises the nations, shall not he correct,
\q Even he that teaches man knowledge?
\q
\v 11 Jehovah knows the thoughts of man,
\q That they are vanity.
\q
\v 12 Blessed is the man whom you chastenest, O Jehovah,
\q And teachest out of your law;
\q
\v 13 That you may give him rest from the days of adversity,
\q Until the pit be digged for the wicked.
\q
\v 14 For Jehovah will not cast off his people,
\q Neither will he forsake his inheritance.
\q
\v 15 For judgment shall return to righteousness;
\q And all the upright in heart shall follow it.
\q
\v 16 Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers?
\q Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
\q
\v 17 Unless Jehovah had been my help,
\q My soul had soon lived in silence.
\q
\v 18 When I said, My foot slippeth;
\q Your lovingkindness, O Jehovah, held me up.
\q
\v 19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me Your comforts delight my soul.
\q
\v 20 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee,
\q Which frameth mischief by statute?
\q
\v 21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
\q And condemn the innocent blood.
\q
\v 22 But Jehovah has been my high tower,
\q And my God the rock of my refuge.
\q
\v 23 And he has brought upon them their own iniquity,
\q And will cut them off in their own wickedness;
\q Jehovah our God will cut them off.
