\c 4
\p
\v 1 Whence come wars and whence come fightings among you?
come they not hence, even of your pleasures that war in your members?
\v 2 You lust, and have not: you kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: you fight and war; you have not, because you ask not.
\v 3 You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may spend
it in your pleasures.
\v 4 You adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of
the world makes himself an enemy of God.
\v 5 Or think you that the scripture speaks in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long to envying?
\v 6 But he gives more grace. Wherefore the scripture saith, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the
humble.
\v 7 Be subject therefore to God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
\v 8 Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you doubleminded.
\v 9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
\v 10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you.
\p
\v 11 Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaks against a brother, or judges his brother, speaks against the
law, and judges the law: but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
\v 12 One only is the lawgiver and judge, even he who is able to save and to destroy: but who are you that
judge your neighbor?
\p
\v 13 Come now, you that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend a youar there, and trade, and get gain:
\v 14 whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For you are a vapor that appears for a little time,
and then vanisheth away.
\v 15 For that you ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that.
\v 16 But now you glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil.
\v 17 To him therefore that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin.
