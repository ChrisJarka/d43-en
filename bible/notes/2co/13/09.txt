====== 2 Corinthians 13:9-10 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 I am happy \add whenever\add* you are strongly \add trusting and obeying Christ, and because of that I do not have to use my authority to discipline you. It does not matter to me if that makes people think that I do not have any authority\add*. Truly, what I am praying for is that \add God\add* will \add help\add* you to completely change your conduct.
\v 10 That is why I am writing these things while I am still away from you. \add What I want is that\add* when I visit you, \add you will already be conducting your lives as God wants you to\add*, and so I will not have to \add discipline you\add* severely, as the \add Lord Jesus Christ gave me\add* the authority to do. The authority that I have from the Lord is to help you to become \add spiritually\add* mature believers, not to cause you to stop \add trusting in him\add*.

<usfm>
\v 9 We have joy when we are weak and you are the strong ones. We pray that your faith may become mature and complete.
\v 10 I am away from you now as I write this to you, so when I come to be with you I do not have to deal with you by my authority and we experience harshness as we deal with these sins. I would rather use my authority to make you stronger in your faith rather than to tear you down and make you weaker.
