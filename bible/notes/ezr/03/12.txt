\v 12 But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathersâ€™ houses, the old men that had seen the first house,
when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
\v 13 so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the
people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
