====== watch, watchman ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "watch" means to look at something or someone intentionally and carefully. A "watch" is also the name for a shift or unit of time (3 to 4 hours) during which a watchman for a city would be on the alert looking out for any threat from an enemy.

  * Figurative meanings of "watch" also include the idea of being careful and giving close attention to something. For example:
      * To "watch your life and doctrine closely" means to be careful about how you live your life and to be careful to believe teaching that is true.
      * To "watch out" is a warning to be careful to avoid danger or harmful behaviors and false teaching.
      * To "keep watch" means to always be alert and on guard against evil.
  * For the purpose of appointing watchmen to guard a city, the 12-hour period at night was divided into equal time periods called "watches." <font 14px line-height: 19.600000381469727px;/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>In New Testament times, the Jews followed the Roman system and had four watches of three hours each.</font>
  * Based on this, the "first watch" would be from sunset to around 9:00 pm, the "second watch" would be from 9:00 pm to midnight, the "third watch" would be from midnight to around 3:00 am and the "fourth watch" would be from 3:00 to 6:00 am.
  * When the exact time is not known,  references to time could be translated with phrases such as, "late afternoon" or "early morning" or "the middle of the night" or "mid-morning."
