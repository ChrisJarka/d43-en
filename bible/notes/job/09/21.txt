\q5
\v 21 I am perfect, but I do not care any more about myself;
\q I despise my own life.
\q
\v 22 It makes no difference, which is why I say
\q that he destroys the perfect and the wicked together.
\q
\v 23 If a plague should suddenly kill, 
\q he will laugh at the afflictions of the innocent.
\q
\v 24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;
\q God covers the faces of its judges.
\q If it is not he who does it, then who is it?
\b
