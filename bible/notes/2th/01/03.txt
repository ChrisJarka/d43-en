<usfm> \v 3 Our fellow believers, we are always thanking God, and we should do this, because you are trusting in the Lord Jesus more and more, and because every one of you is loving each of the others more and more. \v 4 As a result, we keep proudly talking about you to the other groups of believers belonging to God. We tell them how you are being patient and how you continue trusting in the Lord Jesus, even though other people frequently cause you much trouble.

\p \v 5 Since you are enduring all that trouble, we clearly know that God will judge all people justly. In your case, he will declare to everyone that you are worthy for him to rule rule forever, because you accept to suffer as you trust in him. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \p \v 3 We should give thanks to God always for you, brothers, for it is appropriate, because your faith is growing very much, and the love of each one of you abounds toward one another. \v 4 So we ourselves speak proudly about you among the churches of God concerning your patience and faith in all your persecutions and afflictions that you endure. \v 5 This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, with the result that you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you also suffer. </usfm>
