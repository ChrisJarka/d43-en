====== Jeremiah 16:12-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 But you \add who are living now\add* have done more wicked things than your ancestors did! Each of you stubbornly does the evil things that he desires and refuses to pay attention to what I say.
\v 13 So, I will throw you out of this land, and I will send you to a land that you and your ancestors have never known about. There you will worship other gods day and night. And I will not act mercifully toward you.'

<usfm>
\v 12 and you have done evil more than your fathers; for, behold, you walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so
that you listen not to me:
\v 13 therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that you have not known, neither you nor your fathers; and
there shall you serve other gods day and night; for I will show you no favor.
