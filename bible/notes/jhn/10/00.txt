=== Important figures of speech in this chapter ===

== Sheepfold ==
The illustration used here involves the place where sheep are kept. There would have been a door or gate that the shepherd would have normally entered into the sheepfold. The sheep immediately recognize him. On the other hand, a robber would have entered into the sheepfold through another way where he may not be caught. The sheep would likely run from the thief because they did not recognize him. Jesus uses this as a [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] for his ministry.

== "I lay down my life that I may take it again" ==
Although this is not set apart in any way, it is certainly a prophecy concerning Jesus' coming death. It emphasizes that he willingly died for the sins of man.
