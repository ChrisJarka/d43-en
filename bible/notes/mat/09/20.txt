\v 20 And behold, a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment:
\v 21 for she said within herself, If I do but touch his garment, I shall be made whole.
\v 22 But Jesus turning and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you whole. And the woman was made
whole from that hour.
