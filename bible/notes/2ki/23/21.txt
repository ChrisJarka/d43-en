\v 21 Then the king commanded all the people, saying, "Keep the passover to Yahweh your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant."
\v 22 Surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel nor of the kings of Judah.
\v 23 But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this passover was kept to Yahweh in Jerusalem.
