\v 6 When you brought it home, you would call together your friends and neighbors and say to them, 'Be happy with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!'
\v 7 I tell you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* that similarly\add God\add* will be very happy about each and every sinner who turns from doing evil. God does not \add need to\add* be happy about ninety-nine people who \add think that they\add* are \f + \ft irony \f* righteous and think that they do not need to turn from doing evil.

\v 6 And when you come home, you will call together your friends and neighbors and say to them: 'Be joyful with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!'
\v 7 I tell you that, in a similar way, there will be more joy in heaven because of one sinner who repents from his sins than about many righteous people who have already repented.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * Jesus continues his parable
    * **And when he comes home**  - that is, the owner of 100 sheep comes home with the lost sheep
    * **rejoice with me **- That is, "be joyful with me," or "join me in my joy." This is a request not a command, so it can also be translated as, "please be joyful with me," or "please join me in my joy."
    * **for I have found my lost sheep **- That is, "for I have found my sheep, the one I lost," or "because I have found my sheep, the one I lost,"
    * **that even so there will be **- That is, "that in the same way there will be," or "that like the shepherd and his friends and neighbors, there will be.
    * **joy in heaven**  - joy in God's presence
    * **ninety nine righteous person who do not need to repent**- That is, "ninety nine righteous person who need not to repent." This may indicate an irony based on the context, that is, "ninety nine thinking they are righteous that do not need to repent." Or this may indicate, "ninety nine righteous persons not in need of repentance anymore.
