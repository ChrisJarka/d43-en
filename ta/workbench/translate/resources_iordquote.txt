===== Indirect to Direct Quote =====

When adding the option for a direct quote, preface the alternate with "It can be translated as a direct quote:" followed by the new phrase.

  * **to tell no one**  - This can be translated as a direct quote: "Do not tell anyone." The implied information is "that you have been healed." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations|Speech Quotations]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]])
