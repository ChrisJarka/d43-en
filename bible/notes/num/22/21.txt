\v 21 Balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the leaders of Moab.
\v 22 And Godâ€™s anger was kindled because he went. The angel of Yahweh placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his donkey and his two servants were with him.
\v 23 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh who stood in the way with his sword drawn in his hand. The donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. Balaam struck the donkey to turn her into the way.
